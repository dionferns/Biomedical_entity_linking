  "27254792": "Emergence of family medicine in Ethiopia [corrected]: an international collaborative education model Family Medicine (FM) is a new specialty in Ethiopia. The first seven family physicians graduated in February 2016 from the inaugural residency programme at Addis Ababa University. Cooperation amongst Ethiopian and expatriate decision-makers and physicians was needed to begin the programme. Intentional replacement of expatriates with Ethiopian family physicians has begun. Barriers include lack of understanding of FM and the human and financial resources needed for scaling up the programme. Regular programme review with resident physician involvement has allowed the FM training programme to adapt and fit the Ethiopian context. Further successes will result from ongoing support and advocacy from the Federal Ministry of Health and other Ethiopian, African, and international primary care organisations.",
  "27059693": "Patient - Physician Discordance in Global Assessment in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Literature Review With Meta-Analysis The integration of the patient in therapeutic decision-making is important in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the patient opinion regarding disease status may differ from the physician's opinion. The aim of this study was to assess in the published literature the frequency and drivers of patient - physician discordance in global assessment in RA. A systematic literature review of all articles published up to January 2015 in Medline or Embase, reporting discordance in RA, was conducted by 2 investigators. Discordance was defined based on the absolute difference of patient global (PGA) and physician global assessments (PhGA) on 0-10-cm scales. The frequency of discordance and its predictors were collected in each study. Frequencies of discordance were pooled by meta-analysis using random effect. In all, 12 studies were selected (i.e., 11,879 patients): weighted mean ± SD age was 55.1 ± 13.9 years, weighted mean ± SD disease duration was 10.4 ± 9.3 years, and 80.7% were women. The value of the difference | PGA - PhGA | defining discordance varied between ≥0.5 cm (n = 2 studies) to ≥3 cm (n = 5 studies); the weighted mean value was 2.7 cm. The pooled percentage of patients with discordance was 43% (95% confidence interval 36%-51%; range 25%-76%). PGA was usually higher than PhGA. The drivers of PGA were pain and functional incapacity, whereas drivers of PhGA were joint counts and acute-phase reactants. Discordance in global assessment was most frequently defined as a difference of 3 points or more; even with such a stringent definition, up to half the patients were found to be discordant. The long-term consequences of this discordance remain to be determined.",
  "27233592": "Measurement of Outcomes of Upper Limb Reconstructive Surgery for Tetraplegia Reconstructive arm/hand surgery for tetraplegia is performed to improve arm/hand function and therefore personal well-being for individuals who accept such elective surgeries. However, changes at an impairment level do not always translate into functional or quality of life changes. Therefore, multiple outcome tools should be used that incorporate sufficient responsiveness to detect changes in arm/hand function, activity and participation, and quality of life of the individuals involved. This narrative review aims to assist clinicians to choose the most appropriate tools to assess the need for reconstructive surgery and to evaluate its outcomes. Our specific objectives are (1) to describe aspects to consider when choosing a measure and (2) to describe the measures advised by an international therapist consensus group established in 2007. All advised measures are appraised in terms of the underlying construct, administration, and clinical relevance to arm/hand reconstructions. Essentially there are currently no criterion standard measures to evaluate the consequences of reconstructive arm/hand surgery. However, with judicious use of available measures it is possible to ensure the questions asked or tasks completed are relevant to the surgical reconstruction (s) undertaken. Further work in this field is required. This would be best met by immediate collaboration between 2 outcome's tool developers and by analysis of pre - and postoperative data already held in various international sites, which would allow further evaluation of the measures already in use, or components thereof.",

THE ' SIGNIFICANT HARM ' OF RE B AND G (CHILDREN) (CARE PROCEEDINGS)[2015] EWFC 3 The academic debate rages on as to whether male circumcision really is in the best interests of the child or if it constitutes an abusive practice. This commentary discusses the recent case of Re B and G (children) (care proceedings) [2015] EWFC 3, delivered by the current President of the Family Division of the High court, Sir James Munby. Two key issues are raised by this judgment. First, that President Munby's obiter comments constitute an attack on the legally accepted act of male circumcision by suggesting a similar nature between the illegal act of female genital mutilation (FGM) and that of male circumcision as well as the suggestion that male circumcision can be classed as a significant harm. Second, that this case reflects the woefully unprepared condition of the UK medical profession in dealing with FGM.",
  "27262362": "Survival status and functional outcome of children who required prolonged intensive care after cardiac surgery Children who require prolonged intensive care after cardiac surgery are at risk of high mortality. The long-term survival and functional outcome of these children have not been studied in detail. Children who stayed in intensive care for >28 days after cardiac surgery from 1997 to 2012 were studied in a single institution. A total of 116 patients were identified; 107 (92%) were <1 year of age and 63 (54%) had univentricular physiology. The incidence of children requiring prolonged intensive care increased from 1.01/100 undergoing cardiac surgery in 1997 to 2000 to 2.66/100 in 2009 to 2012 (P trend = .002). This increase coincided with an increase in the number of children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome having prolonged intensive care during the same period (0.13/100 in 1997-2000 to 1.0/100 in 2009-2012; P trend = .001). Survival to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) discharge was 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65-82) and 51% (95% CI, 41-59) at 3 years. Factors associated with mortality were univentricular repair (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.21-3.70; P = .008) and acute renal failure (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.77-5.12; P < .001), but era did not influence mortality (1997-2005 vs 2006-2012; log-rank P = .66). Among PICU survivors, 3- year survival in those who did not need early reoperation was 81% (95% CI, 66-90), compared with 58% (95% CI, 42-71) in those who required early reoperation (log-rank P = .01). Among survivors, 36% had either moderate or severe disability and 13% had poor quality of life. The incidence of children requiring prolonged intensive care after cardiac surgery has increase d in our institution. Our data suggest that the long-term outcome for most of these children is poor, especially after univentricular repair.",
  "27258956": "Women's Sexual Issues After Myocardial Infarction: A Literature Review Sexual activity after myocardial infarction (MI) is a concern for patients and often a challenge for health care professionals to address. It is widely recognized that most patients, of both sexes, report sexual problems or concerns after MI. However, there are reported differences between men and women. Women with sexual concerns may seek less help from health care providers and are more inclined to conceal them because of cultural barriers. The aim of the current study is to present a comprehensive review of the literature describing women's sexual issues after MI. A systematic search of the relevant literature was performed within international databases, including PubMed / Medline, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and ProQuest, as well as Google Scholar using relevant keywords. Also, Persian electronic databases such as Magiran, Scientific Information Databases, and Iran Medex were searched from the inception to October 2014. Articles focusing on the sexual issues after MI only in women, as well as articles on both sexes where women's results could be separated, were included in this review. A total of 8 articles were included in the final dataset. The main themes of women's sexual concerns after MI were \" loss or decrease of sexual activity ,\" \" dissatisfaction of sexual relationship ,\" \" doubt about resumption time of sexual activity ,\" \" fear of reinfarction or sudden death during sexual activity after MI ,\" \" knowledge deficit regarding sexual activity after MI ,\" and \" poor performance of health care providers in sexual counseling .\" The results of this review demonstrate that women's post- MI sexual activity is affected by many concerns. The concerns may be a knowledge deficit related to not receiving necessary consultation on this topic. Nurses, as first-line care givers, can provide appropriate consultation and education for patients post- MI. As a result, breaking taboo imposed by cultural barriers, personal assumptions, or lack of confidence on giving sexual consultation may ultimately help patients to improve their quality of life.",
  "27245524": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) were originally described by Ehlers in Denmark and Danlos in Paris in 1898 and 1908, respectively. They had both published individual case studies in which the common factor was laxity of ligaments leading to joint hypermobility and hyperextensibility of the skin. The choice of the name of this eponymous disease had been made by Dr Parkes Weber, an eminent London physician in the 1930s, who had a penchant for eponymous diseases, having had no less than seven attributed to himself, at least in part. Unfortunately, this was before the age of a computerised literature search, and Parkes Weber had inadvertently overlooked the very first description of EDS which had been made by Tchernabogov, a Russian dermatologist, whose description was published in 1891 and remains one of the best descriptions of EDS in the literature.",

In this study, lipid - polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs), which contain both pemetrexed and miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide (anti-miR-21), have been developed for treatment of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain tumor. Prepared LPNs have been well characterized by particle size distribution and zeta potential measurements, determination of encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release experiments. Morphology of LPNs was determined by transmission electron microscopy. LPNs had a hydrodynamic size below 100 nm and exhibited sustained release of pemetrexed up to 10 h. Encapsulation of pemetrexed in LPNs increased cellular uptake from 6% to 78%. Results of confocal microscopy analysis have shown that co-delivery of anti-miR-21 significantly improved accumulation of LPNs in the nucleus of U87MG cells. Nevertheless, more effective cytotoxicity results could not be obtained due to low concentration of anti-miR-21, loaded in LPNs. We expect that the effective drug delivery systems can be obtained with higher concentration of anti-miR-21 for the treatment of glioblastoma.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of swimming training on cardiac expression of Bcl-2, and Mir-133 levels and glycogen changes in the myocyte. Forty animals were separated into four groups as control, sham, ovariectomy (OVX) and ovariectomized group with 8 weeks swimming training (OVX.E). Training effects were evaluated by measuring lipid profiles, Bcl-2 and Mir-133 expression levels in the cardiac tissue. Grafts were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for Bcl-2 mRNA and Mir-133 and by Western blot for Bcl-2 protein. Ovariectomy down-regulated Bcl-2 and Mir-133 expression levels in the cardiac tissue, and swimming training up-regulated their expression significantly (P<0.05). Our results showed that regular exercise as a physical replacement therapy could prevent and improve the effects of estrogen deficiency in the cardia.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether histologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney could enable early identification of unrecognized kidney disease and could be of prognostic value in predicting postoperative renal outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 51 patients with upper urinary tract malignancies who received uninephrectomy or uninephroureterectomy. A thorough pathologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney including special stains, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic studies was performed. The degree of parenchymal changes was graded from 0 to 15. Of 51 patients, only 13 showed normal kidney pathology. Fifteen patients showed glomerular abnormalities, 14 showed diabetic nephropathy, and 11 showed vascular nephropathy. There was one case each of reflux nephropathy and chronic pyelonephritis. The median histologic score was 5 points. Only 25.4% of patients had ≤ 3 points. Score more than 5 was observed in 47.1% of patients. Postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 3 to 36 months were obtained from 90.2% of patients, and of those, 34.8% had de novo CKD. Since no one had CKD in partial nephrectomized patients, we determined risk factors for CKD in radical nephrectomized patients. Cox regression analysis revealed that postoperative AKI, preoperative eGFR, and histologic score of non-neoplastic kidney were the independent predictors for CKD. We conclude that routine pathologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information.",

This study explored AT adaptation by comparing properties within the jump and non-jump legs of jumping athletes. Non-jumping control athletes were included to control limb dominance effects. AT properties were assessed in the preferred (jump) and non-preferred (lead) jumping legs of male collegiate-level long and/or high jump (jumpers; n=10) and cross-country (controls; n=10) athletes. Cross-sectional area (CSA), elongation, and force during isometric contractions were used to estimate the morphological, mechanical and material properties of the ATs bilaterally. Jumpers exposed their ATs to more force and stress than controls (all p≤0.03). AT force and stress were also greater in the jump leg of both jumpers and controls than in the lead leg (all p<0.05). Jumpers had 17.8% greater AT stiffness and 24.4% greater Young's modulus in their jump leg compared to lead leg (all p<0.05). There were no jump versus lead leg differences in AT stiffness or Young's modulus within controls (all p>0.05). ATs chronically exposed to elevated mechanical loading were found to exhibit greater mechanical (stiffness) and material (Young's modulus) properties.",
  "27274893": "Comparison of sonoelastography with sonourethrography and retrograde urethrography in the evaluation of male anterior urethral strictures Retrograde urethrography (RUG) is the most common and preferred imaging modality for imaging of the anterior urethral strictures despite its well-known limitations and disadvantages. Sonourethrography (SUG) was introduced in 1988 to overcome the limitations of RUG and to provide more accurate results. As proper selection of imaging modality is very important for planning the treatment, various advances in this area are required. One of the major factors for recurrence of stricture disease is spongiofibrosis. Sonoelastography (SE) is a newer technique, tried in various other pathologies. In this study, we have used this technique for the first time to assess its efficacy in the evaluation of anterior urethral stricture disease by comparison with RUG and SUG. Between August 2014 and May 2015, 77 patients with clinical features of anterior urethral stricture disease were included in the study and evaluated by RUG followed by SUG and SE for stricture location, length, depth of spongiofibrosis and periurethral pathologies. The results were then correlated with operative and histopathological findings. Overall diagnostic accuracy of SE, SUG, and RGU for the estimation of stricture location, and length were estimated 92.68% vs. 91.54%, 79% vs. 78.87% and 80.48% vs. 43.66%, respectively, while for depth of spongiofibrosis SE, and SUG had accuracy rates of 87.3%, 48%, respectively. The mean length measured on SE was nearest to the mean intra-operative stricture length (21.34+11.8 mm). SE findings significantly correlated with the colour of bladder mucosa on cystoscopic examination (p=0.003) whereas the association was non-significant (p=0.127) for difficulty in incision. While a nonsignificant correlation existed between SUG findings related both to the colour of the bladder mucosa and difficulty in incision on cystoscopy, SE findings had a significant association (p<0.001) with histopathology findings for severe degree of fibrosis. Sonoelastography estimates stricture site and length better in comparison with RUG and SUG. It estimates degree of spongiofibrosis which serves as an important prognostic factor for stricture recurrence more accurately than SUG.",
  "27250949": "Strategies for Assaying Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization Late endosomal organelles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes to degrade cargo delivered either from the extracellular environment by endocytosis or from within the cell itself by autophagy. In the event of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), the contents of late endosomes and lysosomes can be released into the cytosol and then initiate apoptosis. Compounds that can trigger LMP are therefore candidates for the induction of apoptosis, in particular in anticancer therapy. Alternatively, drug-delivery systems, such as nanoparticles, can have side effects that can include LMP, which has toxic consequences for the cells. To determine when, to what extent, and with what consequences LMP occurs is therefore of paramount importance for the evaluation of new potentially LMP - inducing compounds. In this introduction, we provide an overview of some basic assays for assessing LMP, such as staining with lysosomotropic dyes and measurement of cysteine cathepsin activity, and discuss additional strategies for the detection of the release of endogenous lysosomal molecules or preloaded exogenous tracers into the cytosol.",
  "27283994": "Juglone ameliorates skin wound healing by promoting skin cell migration through Rac1 / Cdc42 / PAK pathway Skin cell regeneration and wound healing are key processes in the recovery from skin injuries. Rapid cell migration and regeneration of skin cells lead to faster and better healing of wounded skin. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the wound healing potential of juglone, a naturally occurring Pin1 inhibitor found in walnuts. Cultured skin cells (NHDF and HaCaT) and hairless mice were treated with juglone after wound creation to examine its effects on cell migration and wound healing rate. The expressions of cell migration related proteins (Rac1, Cdc42, and α-PAK), collagen deposition, and angiogenesis were analyzed. Juglone treatment resulted in faster rate of growth and migration and recovered cell morphology, particularly at a concentration of 5 µM, in skin cells compared to the untreated group. In vivo experiments showed that mice treated with juglone showed faster wound healing rate with better skin morphology and collagen deposition than the vehicle group. Furthermore, juglone increased the activation and/or expression of Cdc42, Rac1, and α-pak in HaCaT cells, and resulted in enhanced angiogenesis in endothelial cells (HUVECs). Juglone also activated MAPKs signaling by activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 proteins. Taken together, these data suggest that juglone may be a potential candidate for wound healing and skin regeneration which ameliorates wound healing mainly by promoting skin cell migration through Rac1 / Cdc42 / PAK pathway.",
  "27280485": "Hepatitis E virus in donor plasma collected in Japan Human hepatitis E virus (HEV) is prevalent worldwide. Iatrogenic HEV has recently been identified based on the reports of transfusion-transmitted cases. The detection rate of HEV-RNA and seroprevalence of HEV-IgG / IgM have been regionally evaluated in Japan, and donor plasma collected in Hokkaido is currently screened by nucleic acid amplification testing. However, the detection rate of HEV-RNA in blood donors in Japan outside of Hokkaido has not been reported. A total of 620 140 qualified donor plasma samples from Japanese regions excluding Hokkaido were tested for HEV-RNA (pools of 50 or 500) between 2004 and 2014. HEV-RNA-positive plasma bags were identified, and the HEV viral load, genotype and anti-HEV immunoglobulin (Ig)G/IgM were evaluated. The detection rate of HEV-RNA (pools of 50) was 1/15 075 and higher in eastern than in western Japan. All 36 HEV-RNA-positive samples were genotype 3 with viral load ranging from <1·69 to 7·22 log10 copies/ml. Our detection rate of HEV-RNA in donor populations in Japan outside Hokkaido (1/15 075 donations) is generally lower than reported in Europe and lower than previously reported for Hokkaido (1/8173 donations). As methods varied, we cannot exclude that these differences are reflective of differing RNA detection limits. In contrast to Hokkaido where genotype 4 has been reported among blood donations, all our positive donations were genotype 3, which is less pathogenic.",
  "27241291": "In Search of the E. coli Compounds that Change the Antibiotic Production Pattern of Streptomyces coelicolor During Inter-species Interaction The aim of this work was to investigate the interaction between E.coli and Streptomyces coelicolor A3 (2) for the increased production of undecylprodigiosin and identify the E. coli actives mediating this inter-species interaction. The antibiotics of interest were the red-pigmented undecylprodigiosin and blue-pigmented actinorhodin. Pure cultures of S. coelicolor in a defined medium produced higher concentrations of actinorhodin compared to those of undecylprodigiosin. The latter however, is more important due to its immunosuppressive and antitumor properties. As a strategy to increase undecylprodigiosin production, we added separately, live cells and heat-killed cells of E. coli C600, and the cell-free supernatant of E. coli culture to S. coelicolor cultures in shake flasks. The interaction with live cells of E. coli altered the antibiotic production pattern and undecylprodigiosin production was enhanced by 3.5-fold compared to the pure cultures of S. coelicolor and actinorhodin decreased by 15-fold. The heat-killed cells of E. coli however, had no effect on antibiotic production. In all cases, growth and glucose consumption of S. coelicolor remained almost the same as those observed in the pure culture indicating that the changes in antibiotic production were not due to nutritional stress. Results with cell-free supernatant of E. coli culture indicated that the interaction between S. coelicolor and E. coli was mediated via diffusible molecule(s). Using a set of extraction procedures and agar-well diffusion bioassays, we isolated and preliminarily identified a class of compounds. For the preliminary verification, we added the compound which was the common chemical structural moiety in this class of compounds to the pure S. coelicolor cultures. We observed similar effects on antibiotic production as with the live E. coli cells and their supernatant indicating that this class of compounds secreted by E. coli indeed could act as actives during interspecies interaction and increase the production of undecylprodigiosin.",

Additionally, the mitochondrial genome of another member of the Cryphonectriaceae, namely Cryphonectria parasitica (158,902 bp), was retrieved and annotated for comparative purposes. These genomes showed high levels of synteny, especially in regions including genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer, unique open reading frames (uORFs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs), as well as intron positions. Comparative analyses revealed signatures of duplication events, intron number and length variation, and varying intronic ORFs which highlighted the genetic diversity of mt genomes among the Cryphonectriaceae. These mt genomes showed remarkable size polymorphism. The size polymorphism in the mt genomes of these closely related Chrysoporthe species was attributed to the varying number and length of introns, coding sequences and to a lesser extent, intergenic sequences. Compared to publicly available fungal mt genomes, the C. austroafricana mt genome is the second largest in the Ascomycetes thus far.",

This controlled, randomised clinical trial was conducted at General Surgery and Trauma of the Clinics Hospital, Medical School, the University of Sγo Paulo between September 2010 and February 2011. Totally, 50 male patients, with a bilateral inguinal hernia, older than 25 years were considered eligible for the study. The following parameters were analysed during the early post-operative period: (1) The intensity of surgical trauma, operation time, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, white blood cell count, bleeding and pain intensity; (2) quality of life assessment; and (3) post-operative complications. LTE procedure was longer than the Stoppa procedure (134.6 min ΁ 38.3 vs. 90.6 min ΁ 41.3; P < 0.05). The levels of CRP were higher in the Stoppa group (P < 0.05) but the number of leucocytes, haematocrit, and haemoglobin were similar between the groups (P > 0.05). There was no difference in pain during the 1 st and 7 th post-operative, physical functioning, physical limitation, the impact of pain on daily activities, and the Carolinas Comfort Scale during the 7 th and 15 th post-operative (P > 0.05). Complications occurred in 88% of Stoppa group (22 patients) and 64% in LTE group (16 patients) (P < 0.05). The comparative study between the Stoppa and LTE approaches for the bilateral inguinal hernia repair demonstrated that: (1) The LTE approach showed less surgical trauma despite the longer operation time; (2) Quality of life during the early post-operative period were similar; and (3) Complication rates were higher in the Stoppa group.",
  "27245335": "The effects of paternal high-fat diet exposure on offspring metabolism with epigenetic changes in the mouse adiponectin and leptin gene promoters Recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic changes resulting from malnutrition might play important roles in transgenerational links with metabolic diseases. Previously, we observed that exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) in utero caused a metabolic syndrome -like phenomenon through epigenetic modifications of the adiponectin and leptin genes that persisted for multiple generations. Recent etiological studies indicated that paternal BMI had effects on offspring BMI that were independent of but additive to maternal BMI effects. Thus, we examined whether paternal HFD - induced obesity affected the metabolic status of offspring through epigenetic changes in the adiponectin and leptin genes. Additionally, we investigated whether a normal diet during subsequent generations abolished the epigenetic changes associated with paternal HFD exposure before conception. We observed the effects of paternal HFD exposure before conception over multiple generations on offspring metabolic traits, including weight and fat gain, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, abnormal adipocytokine levels, hypertension, and adiponectin and leptin gene expression and epigenetic changes. Normal diet consumption by male offspring during the subsequent generation following paternal HFD exposure diminished whereas consumption for two generations completely abolished the effect of paternal HFD exposure on metabolic traits and adipocytokine promoter epigenetic changes in the offspring. The effects of paternal HFD exposure on offspring were relatively weaker than those following HFD exposure in utero. However, paternal HFD exposure had an additive metabolic effect for two generations, suggesting that both paternal and maternal nutrition might affect offspring metabolism through epigenetic modifications of adipocytokine genes for multiple generations.",
  "27261525": "The N-Methyl d-Aspartate Glutamate Receptor Antagonist Ketamine Disrupts the Functional State of the Corticothalamic Pathway The non-competitive N-methyl d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine elicits a brain state resembling high-risk states for developing psychosis and early stages of schizophrenia characterized by sensory and cognitive deficits and aberrant ongoing gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz)in cortical and subcortical structures, including the thalamus. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. The goal of the present study was to determine whether a ketamine - induced psychotic - relevant state disturbs the functional state of the corticothalamic (CT) pathway. Multisite field recordings were performed in the somatosensory CT system of the sedated rat. Baseline activity was challenged by activation of vibrissa - related prethalamic inputs. The sensory - evoked thalamic response was characterized by a short - latency (∼4 ms) prethalamic -mediated negative sharp potential and a longer latency (∼10 ms) CT -mediated negative potential. Following a single subcutaneous injection of ketamine (2.5 mg/kg), spontaneously occurring and sensory - evoked thalamic gamma oscillations increased and decreased in power, respectively. The power of the sensory -related gamma oscillations was positively correlated with both the amplitude and the area under the curve of the corresponding CT potential but not with the prethalamic potential. The present results show that the layer VI CT pathway significantly contributes in thalamic gamma oscillations, and they support the hypothesis that reduced NMDAR activation disturbs the functional state of CT and corticocortical networks.",

An evaluation is also made of the renal failure rate and related economic outcomes between study groups. An economic post hoc evaluation of a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 4 study was carried out. Nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA in hospitalized adults. The modified intent to treat (mITT) population comprised 224 linezolid - and 224 vancomycin - treated patients. Costs and HCRU were evaluated between patients administered either linezolid or vancomycin, and between patients who developed renal failure and those who did not. Analysis of HCRU outcomes and costs. Total costs were similar between the linezolid - (€17,782±€9,615) and vancomycin - treated patients (€17,423±€9,460) (P=.69). The renal failure rate was significantly lower in the linezolid - treated patients (4% vs. 15%; P<.001). The total costs tended to be higher in patients who developed renal failure (€19,626±€10,840 vs. €17,388±€9,369; P=.14). Among the patients who developed renal failure, HCRU (days on mechanical ventilation: 13.2±10.7 vs. 7.6±3.6 days; P=.21; ICU stay: 14.4±10.5 vs. 9.9±6.6 days; P=.30; hospital stay: 19.5±9.5 vs. 16.1±11.0 days; P=.26) and cost (€17,219±€8,792 vs. €20,263±€11,350; P=.51) tended to be lower in the linezolid - vs. vancomycin - treated patients. There were no statistically significant differences in costs per patient - day between cohorts after correcting for mortality (€1000 vs. €1,010; P=.98). From a Spanish perspective, there were no statistically significant differences in total costs between the linezolid and vancomycin pneumonia cohorts. The drug cost corresponding to linezolid was partially offset by fewer renal failure adverse events.",
  "27271770": "Interleukin-1β induced Stress Granules Sequester COX-2 mRNA and Regulates its Stability and Translation in Human OA Chondrocytes Enhanced and immediate expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA is observed in IL-1β - stimulated OA chondrocytes but the synthesis of protein found significantly delayed. Here we investigated the role of stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes that regulate mRNA translation, in the delayed translation of COX-2 mRNAs in IL-1β - stimulated OA chondrocytes. Stimulation of human chondrocytes with IL-1β activated the stress response genes and the phosphorylation of eIF2α that triggered the assembly of SGs. Using combined immunofluorescence staining of SGs markers and COX-2 protein, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA immunoprecipitation, the COX-2 mRNAs were found sequestered in SGs in IL-1β - stimulated OA chondrocytes. No increase in COX-2 protein expression was observed during the persistence of SGs but enhanced expression of COX-2 protein was noted upon clearance of the SGs. Inhibition of SGs clearance blocked COX-2 mRNA translation whereas blocking the assembly of SGs by TIA-1 depletion resulted in rapid and increased production of COX-2 and PGE2. Our findings show for the first time assembly of SGs and sequestration of COX-2 mRNAs in human OA chondrocytes under pathological conditions. Post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 mRNAs translation by SGs indicates a role in IL-1β -mediated catabolic response that could be therapeutically targeted in OA.",
  "27254091": "Using Evolutionary Theory to Guide Mental Health Research Evolutionary approaches to medicine can shed light on the origins and etiology of disease. Such an approach may be especially useful in psychiatry, which frequently addresses conditions with heterogeneous presentation and unknown causes. We review several previous applications of evolutionary theory that highlight the ways in which psychiatric conditions may persist despite and because of natural selection. One lesson from the evolutionary approach is that some conditions currently classified as disorders (because they cause distress and impairment) may actually be caused by functioning adaptations operating \" normally \" (as designed by natural selection). Such conditions suggest an alternative illness model that may generate alternative intervention strategies. Thus, the evolutionary approach suggests that psychiatry should sometimes think differently about distress and impairment. The complexity of the human brain, including normal functioning and potential for dysfunctions, has developed over evolutionary time and has been shaped by natural selection. Understanding the evolutionary origins of psychiatric conditions is therefore a crucial component to a complete understanding of etiology.",
  "27244841": "Improving Early Identification and Ongoing Care of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder Poor adherence to recommended screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and pediatricians ' lack of confidence in providing care for children with ASD reflect quality gaps in primary care. This study aimed to increase the proportion of toddlers screened for ASD and improve physicians ' self-efficacy in providing care to children with ASD. Twenty-six Utah primary care practices participated in a 3 to 6 month learning collaborative (LC) to improve identification and ongoing care of children with ASD. Monthly chart audits assessed whether an ASD screening tool was administered at 18- and 24- month visits. Physicians completed pre-LC and post-LC surveys to assess changes in self-efficacy in providing care and changes in perceived barriers to implementation of screening and caring for children with ASD. Before the LC, 15% of 18- and 24- month visits had documented ASD screening, compared with 91% during the last month of the LC (P < .001). This rate of ASD screening was sustained 4 years after the LC by most practices. Compared with survey responses before the LC, physicians reported significant improvement in their ability to care for children with ASD and decreases in their perceived barriers to screening and caring for children with ASD. The LC was effective in increasing and sustaining recommended ASD screening of toddlers and improving physicians ' perceived self-efficacy in caring for children with ASD. Improving primary care screening, skills, and knowledge may improve the timing of diagnosis, initiation of treatment, quality of care, and outcomes for children with ASD.",
  "27242550": "Mitochondrial Ultrastructure and Glucose Signaling Pathways Attributed to the Kv1.3 Ion Channel Gene-targeted deletion of the potassium channel Kv1.3 (Kv1.3(-∕-)) results i n \"S uper-smeller\" mice with a se nsory p h enotype t hat includes an increased olfactory ability linked to changes in olfactory circuitry, increased abundance of olfactory cilia, and increased expression of odorant receptors and the G-protein, Golf. Kv1.3(-∕-) mice a lso have a metabolic p h enotype i ncluding lo wer b o dy weight a nd de creased a d iposity, in creased total energy expenditure (TEE), increased locomotor activity, and resistance to both diet - and genetic-induced obesity. We explored two cellular aspects to elucidate the mechanism by which loss of Kv1.3 channel in the olfactory bulb (OB) may enhance glucose utilization and metabolic rate. First, using in situ hybridization we find that Kv1.3 and the insulin - dependent glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) are co-localized to the mitral cell layer of the OB. Disruption of Kv1.3 conduction via construction of a pore mutation (W386F Kv1.3) was sufficient to independently translocate GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in HEK 293 cells. Because olfactory sensory perception and the maintenance of action potential (AP) firing frequency by mitral cells of the OB is highly energy demanding and Kv1.3 is also expressed in mitochondria, we next explored the structure of this organelle in mitral cells. We challenged wildtype (WT) and Kv1.3(-∕-) male mice with a m oderately high-fat diet (M HF, 31.8 % kcal fat) for 4 months and then examined OB ultrastructure using transmission electron microscopy. In WT mice, mitochondria were significantly enlarged following diet-induced obesity (DIO) and there were fewer mitochondria, likely due to mitophagy. Interestingly, mitochondria were significantly smaller in Kv1.3(-∕-) mice c ompared with that of W T mice. Similar to their m etabolic r esistance to D IO, the K v1.3(-∕-) mice ha d unchanged mit ochondria in terms of cros s sectional area and abundance following a challenge with modified diet. We are very interested to understand how targeted disruption of the Kv1.3 channel in the OB can modify TEE. Our study demonstrates that Kv1.3 regulates mitochondrial structure and alters glucose utilization; two important metabolic changes that could drive whole system changes in metabolism initiated at the OB.",
  "27252074": "The Chinese Herbal Mixture Tien-Hsien Liquid Augments the Anticancer Immunity in Tumor Cell - Vaccinated Mice Background The Chinese herbal mixture, Tien-Hsien liquid (THL), has been used as an anticancer dietary supplement for more than 20 years. Our previous studies have shown that THL can modulate immune response and inhibit tumor growth. In this study, we further evaluated the effect of THL on anticancer immune response in mice vaccinated with γ-ray - irradiated tumor cells. Methods The antitumor effect of THL was determined in mice vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low colon cancer cells or γ-ray-irradiated high-tumorigenic CT-26-high colon cancer cells. The number of natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes in the spleen was analyzed by flow cytometry. The tumor - killing activities of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were analyzed by flow cytometry using YAC-1 and CT-26-high cells, respectively, as target cells. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Results THL suppressed the growth of CT-26-high tumor in mice previously vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low cells or γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the populations of NK cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes in the spleen and enhanced the tumor - killing activities of NK cells and CTL in mice vaccinated with γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α in mice vaccinated with γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. Conclusion THL can enhance the antitumor immune responses in mice vaccinated with killed tumor cells. These results suggest that THL may be used as a complementary medicine for cancer patients previously treated with killed tumor cell vaccines, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.",
  "27245303": "Dynamics of intestinal metabolites and morphology in response to necrotic enteritis challenge in broiler chickens Despite the relatively small contribution to metabolizable energy that volatile fatty acids (VFAs) provide in chickens, these organic acids have been reported to play beneficial roles in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of birds, for example, inhibition of the growth of some pathogenic bacteria. However, information regarding the dynamics of these metabolites in the GIT of chickens is still scarce, especially under disease conditions such as necrotic enteritis (NE). Here, we investigated the dynamics of VFAs and lactic acid, and intestinal morphology in response to NE predisposing factors, that is, excessive dietary fishmeal and Eimeria inoculation, and causative agent Clostridium perfringens producing NetB toxin. The experiment was designed in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with or without: fishmeal feeding, Eimeria inoculation and C. perfringens challenge. The results showed that these factors significantly influenced composition and concentration of VFAs and lactic acids, pH and histomorphometry in one way or another. These changes may be important for the onset of NE or only the synergetic responses to micro environmental stress. Eimeria appeared to be more important than fishmeal in predisposing birds to NE, thus the application of Eimeria in NE challenge provides more consistent success in inducing the disease. The metabolic responses to various adverse factors such as excessive dietary fishmeal and Eimeria infection are complex. Thus, intensive efforts are required to better understand NE so as to achieve the control of the disease in the absence of antibiotics.",
  "27261587": "Combination of telmisartan with sildenafil ameliorate progression of diabetic nephropathy in streptozotocin - induced diabetic model Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the world. Several signaling pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of DN including elevation in level of angiotensin II, formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE), activation of protein kinase c (PKC), and lipid accumulation. These pathways activate one another mutually leading to oxidative stress, increasing expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β 1) and release of interleukins and adhesion molecules, so the aim of this study is to interrupt more than pathogenic pathway to ameliorate the progression of DN. In the present study, white male rats (N=48) were divided into six groups (8 rats each), the first two groups served as normal control and a control vehicle group while the remaining four groups were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of Streptozotocin (STZ) and being left for 4 weeks to develop DN. Thereafter, the rats were divided into DN group, DN group receiving Telmisartan or Sildenafil or Telmisartan Sildenafil combination. After the specified treatment period, urine samples were collected (using metabolic cages) to measure proteinuria, animals were then euthanized, blood and tissue samples were collected for measurement of Blood glucose, BUN, S.Cr, LDL, NO, TGF-β1, IL-1β, AGEPs, and SOD. The combination therapy showed significant decrease in BUN, S.Cr, LDL, TGF-β1, IL-1β, Proteinuria and AGEPs and significant increase in SOD and NO. The findings showed that combination therapy was able to ameliorate DN and that the effects were superior to the single drugs alone.",
  "27265654": "Conservation education and habitat restoration for the endangered Sagalla caecilian (Boulengerula niedeni) in Sagalla Hill, Kenya The Sagalla caecilian (Boulengerula niedeni) is an endangered amphibian endemic to Sagalla Hill in the Taita Hills. This burrowing worm -like species prefers soft soil with high moisture and organic matter. The major threats to the Sagalla caecilian are soil erosion caused by steep slopes, bare ground and water siphoning / soil hardening from exotic eucalyptus trees. The purpose of this study was to get a better understanding of the local people's attitude towards this species and how they can contribute to its continued conservation through restoration of its remaining habitat. In this study, it was found that 96% of Sagalla people are aware of the species, its habits and its association with soils high in organic matter. It was also found that 96% of Sagalla people use organic manure from cow dung in their farms. Habitat restoration through planting of indigenous plants was found to be ongoing, especially on compounds of public institutions as well as on private lands. Although drought was found to be a challenge for seedlings development especially on the low elevation sites, destruction by livestock especially during the dry season is also a major threat. In this study, it was recommended that any future habitat restoration initiative should include strong chain-link fencing to protect the seedlings from livestock activity. Recognizing that the preferred habitats for the species are in the valleys, systematic planting of keystone plant species such as fig trees (Ficus) creates the best microhabitats. These are better than general woodlots of indigenous trees."
