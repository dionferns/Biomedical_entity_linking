The past decade has witnessed tremendous growth in research on SCD, which may reflect the recognition of SCD as the earliest symptomatic manifestation of AD. Yet methodological challenges associated with establishing common assessment and classification procedures hamper the construct. This article reviews essential features of SCD associated with preclinical AD and current measurement approaches, highlighting challenges in harmonizing study findings across settings. We consider the relation of SCD to important variables and outcomes (e.g., AD biomarkers, clinical progression). We also examine the role of self- and informant - reports in SCD and various psychological, medical, and demographic factors that influence the self-report of cognition. We conclude with a discussion of intervention strategies for SCD, ethical considerations, and future research priorities.",
  "28348878": "A phylogenomic framework for assessing the global emergence and evolution of clonal complex 398 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Distinct clones of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have emerged as important causes of infection in individuals who have exposure to livestock (livestock -associated MRSA; LA-MRSA). Clonal complex 398 (CC398) is the most prevalent LA-MRSA clone, and has been reported from several geographical settings, including Europe, the Americas and Asia. To understand the factors contributing to the global dissemination of this clone, we analysed CC398 MRSA isolates from New Zealand (NZ), a geographically isolated country with an economy strongly dependent on livestock farming. We supplemented the NZ CC398 MRSA collection with global datasets of CC398 MRSA and CC398 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Here, we demonstrate multiple sporadic incursions of CC398 MRSA into NZ, as well as recent importation and spread of a swine -associated clade related to the European LA-MRSA lineage. Within a larger global phylogenomic framework, Bayesian modelling suggested that this NZ clade emerged in the late 2000s, with a probable origin in swine from Western Europe. Elucidating the factors responsible for the incursion and spread of LA-MRSA in geographically distant regions, such as NZ, provides important insights into global pathways of S. aureus transmission, and will inform strategies to control importation and spread.",
  "27778115": "Influence of dentin thickness on intrapulpal temperature under simulated pulpal pressure during Nd:YAG laser irradiation The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dentin thickness and pulpal pressure simulation (PPS) on the variation of intrapulpal temperature (∆T) when submitted to an adhesive technique using laser irradiation. Sixty sound human molars were sectioned and randomly divided into two groups (n = 30): group 1-1 mm of dentin thickness; group 2-2 mm of dentin thickness. Each group was divided into two subgroups (n = 15): subgroup A - absence of PPS; subgroup P - presence of PPS (15 cm H2O), sequentially treated with the following: 37 % phosphoric acid, adhesive system (Adper Single Bond), irradiation with Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 10 Hz, 60 s) using 60, 80, and 100 mJ/ pulse energy parameters and light-curing (10 s). The ∆T was evaluated during the laser irradiation with a digital thermometer. Data were analyzed by three-way ANOVA and Tukey tests (p < 0.05). Three-way ANOVA revealed no significant differences for dentin thickness (p = 0.6512) on ∆T. PPS significantly reduced ∆T (p = 0.0001). The laser energy parameters (p = 0.0027) indicated that 100 mJ presented with significantly greater ∆T when compared to the groups irradiated with 80 and 60 mJ. Dentin thickness did not affect ∆T. The presence of PPS reduced the mean temperature values. The Nd:YAG laser energy parameters had a negative influence on the variation of temperature in the absence of PPS. In the presence of PPS, there was no risk to the pulp, since this study obtained temperature increases below 5.5 °C for all energy parameters, showing the technical viability for in vivo conditions.",
  "27358636": "Diagnostic value of diffusion weighted MRI and ADC in differential diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma of the liver To investigate the use of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the diagnosis of hemangioma. The study population consisted of 72 patients with liver masses larger than 1 cm (72 focal lesions). DWI examination with a b value of 600 s/mm2 was carried out for all patients. After DWI examination, an ADC map was created and ADC values were measured for 72 liver masses and normal liver tissue (control group). The average ADC values of normal liver tissue and focal liver lesions, the \" cut-off \" ADC values, and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the ADC map in diagnosing hemangioma, benign and malignant lesions were researched. Of the 72 liver masses, 51 were benign and 21 were malignant. Benign lesions comprised 38 hemangiomas and 13 simple cysts. Malignant lesions comprised 9 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 12 metastases. The highest ADC values were measured for cysts (3.782±0.53×10(-3) mm(2)/s) and hemangiomas (2.705±0.63×10(-3) mm(2)/s). The average ADC value of hemangiomas was significantly higher than malignant lesions and the normal control group (p<0.001). The average ADC value of cysts were significantly higher when compared to hemangiomas and normal control group (p<0.001). To distinguish hemangiomas from malignant liver lesions, the \" cut-off \" ADC value of 1.800×10(-3) mm(2)/s had a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 90.9%. To distinguish hemangioma from normal liver parenchyma the \" cut-off\" value of 1.858×10(-3) mm(2)/s had a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 95.7%. To distinguish benign liver lesions from malignant liver lesions the \" cut-off\" value of 1.800×10(-3) mm(2)/s had a sensitivity of 96.1% and a specificity of 90.0%. DWI and quantitative measurement of ADC values can be used in differential diagnosis of benign and malignant liver lesions and also in the diagnosis and differentiation of hemangiomas. When dynamic examination cannot distinguish cases with vascular metastasis and lesions from hemangioma, DWI and ADC values can be useful in the primary diagnosis and differential diagnosis. The technique does not require contrast material, so it can safely be used in patients with renal failure.",
  "28412023": "Precise prediction of activators for the human constitutive androstane receptor using structure -based three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship methods The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) regulates the expression of numerous drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. The upregulation of various enzymes, including CYP2B6, by CAR activators is a critical problem leading to clinically severe drug-drug interactions (DDIs). To date, however, few effective computational approaches for identifying CAR activators exist. In this study, we aimed to develop three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models to predict the CAR activating potency of compounds emerging in the drug-discovery process. Models were constructed using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) based on the molecular alignments of ligands binding to CAR, which were obtained from ensemble ligand-docking using 28 compounds as a training set. The CoMFA model, modified by adding a lipophilic parameter with calculated logD7.4 (S+logD7.4), demonstrated statistically good predictive ability (r(2) = 0.99, q(2) = 0.74). We also confirmed the excellent predictability of the 3D-QSAR model for CAR activation (r(2)pred = 0.71) using seven compounds as a test set for external validation. Collectively, our results indicate that the 3D-QSAR model developed in this study provides precise prediction of CAR activating potency and, thus, should be useful for selecting drug candidates with minimized DDI risk related to enzyme-induction in the early drug-discovery stage.",
  "28026207": "Impact sports and bone fractures among adolescents The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of different sports on stress fractures among adolescents during a 9- month follow-up period. The sample was composed of 184 adolescents divided into three groups (impact sports [n = 102]; swimming [n = 35]; non-sports [n = 47]). The occurrence of stress fracture was reported by participants and coaches. As potential confounders we considered age, sex, resistance training, body composition variables and age at peak of height velocity. There were 13 adolescents who reported fractures during the 9- month period. Bone mineral density values were higher in adolescents engaged in impact sports (P-value = 0.002). Independently of confounders, the risk of stress fracture was lower in adolescents engaged in impact sports than in non-active adolescents (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.05 to 0.98]), while swimming practice was not associated to lower risk of fracture (HR = 0.49 [95% CI = 0.09 to 2.55]). In conclusion, the findings from this study indicate the importance of sports participation among adolescents in the reduction of stress fracture risk, especially with impact sports. More importantly, these results could be relevant for recognising adolescents in danger of not reaching their potential for peak bone mass and later an increased risk of fractures.",
  "28411263": "Use of Platelet Function Testing Before Pipeline Embolization Device Placement: A Multicenter Cohort Study Thromboembolic complications constitute a significant source of morbidity after neurointerventional procedures. Flow diversion using the pipeline embolization device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms necessitates the use of dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce this risk. The use of platelet function testing before pipeline embolization device placement remains controversial. A retrospective review of prospectively maintained databases at 3 academic institutions was performed from the years 2009 to 2016 to identify patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with pipeline embolization device placement. Clinical and radiographic data were analyzed with emphasis on thromboembolic complications and clopidogrel responsiveness. A total of 402 patients underwent 414 pipeline embolization device procedures for the treatment of 465 intracranial aneurysms. Thromboembolic complications were encountered in 9.2% of procedures and were symptomatic in 5.6%. Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications compared with clopidogrel responders (17.4% versus 5.6%). This risk was significantly lower in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor when compared with patients who remained on clopidogrel (2.7% versus 24.4%). In patients who remained on clopidogrel, the rate of thromboembolic complications was significantly lower in those who received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure when compared with those who did not (9.8% versus 51.9%). There was no significant difference in the rate of hemorrhagic complications between groups. Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications when compared with clopidogrel responders. However, this risk seems to be mitigated in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor or received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure.",
  "27505653": "Pupil dynamics with periodic flashes: effect of age on mesopic adaptation The purpose of this study is to determine the pupillary dynamics with periodical flashes from a peripheral glare source, in similar conditions to night driving, while focusing on dependence with age. We measured two groups of people: youth and adults. Maximum pupil size decreases due to periodic flashes. Latency does not present significant differences. The reduction of pupil size is greater for older adults. The presence of a peripheral and periodic glare source modifies the pupil size. This leads to a reduction of retinal illuminance, which is greater for older adults.",
  "27412526": "Variability in conditioned pain modulation predicts response to NSAID treatment in patients with knee osteoarthritis Patients with painful knee osteoarthritis (OA) demonstrate hyperalgesia and altered pain-modulatory responses. While some prior work has demonstrated cross-sectional associations between laboratory and clinical pain measures, it is unknown whether individual variability in quantitative sensory testing (QST) responses at baseline can prospectively predict analgesic treatment responses. Patients with knee OA (n = 35) were compared on QST responses to a demographically -matched pain-free control group (n = 39), after which patients completed a month-long treatment study of diclofenac sodium topical gel (1 %), applied up to 4 times daily. OA patients demonstrated reduced pain thresholds at multiple anatomic sites, as well as reduced conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and enhanced temporal summation of pain. The most pain-sensitive patients tended to report the most intense and neuropathic OA pain. Following diclofenac treatment, the knee OA cohort showed a roughly 30 % improvement in pain, regardless of the presence or absence of neuropathic symptoms. Baseline CPM scores, an index of endogenous pain-inhibitory capacity, were prospectively associated with treatment -related changes in clinical pain. Specifically, participants with higher CPM at baseline (i.e., better functioning endogenous pain - inhibitory systems) showed more reduction in pain at the end of treatment (p < .05). These results support prior findings of amplified pain sensitivity and reduced pain-inhibition in OA patients. Moreover, the moderate to strong associations between laboratory-based measures of pain sensitivity and indices of clinical pain highlight the clinical relevance of QST in this sample. Finally, the prospective association between CPM and diclofenac response suggests that QST-based phenotyping may have utility in explaining inter-patient variability in long-term analgesic treatment outcomes.

  "27546724": "The relationship between social functioning and subjective memory complaints in older persons: a population -based longitudinal cohort study Poor social functioning is associated with cognitive decline in older adults. It is unclear whether social functioning is also associated with subjective memory complaints (SMC). We investigated the association between social functioning and incident SMC and SMC recovery. A population -based sample of 8762 older adults (aged ≥65 years) with good objective cognitive functioning at baseline (MMSE ≥26) from the LifeLines Cohort Study were followed for 1.5 years. Self-reported SMC were measured at baseline and after 1.5 years follow-up. Aspects of social functioning included marital status, household composition, social network size, social activity, quality of social relationships, social support, affection, behavioral confirmation, and status. Thirteen percent (513/3963) developed SMC during follow-up (incident SMC). Multivariate logistic regression analyses (adjusted for age, gender, education level, physical activity, alcohol use, smoking status, depression, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke) showed that participants with better feelings of affection, behavioral confirmation and stable good social support had a lower risk of incident SMC. Thirty-four percent (1632/4799) reported recovery. Participants with good social functioning at baseline on all determinants reported more SMC recovery. People who remained stable in a relationship, stable in good quality of social relationships or increased in quality of social relationships more often report SMC recovery. Good social functioning is associated with less incident SMC and more SMC recovery over a follow-up period of 1.5 years. Albeit future confirmative studies are needed, we argue for targeting also social functioning when designing multidomain interventions to prevent or slow down cognitive decline.

  "27378028": "Demonstration and validation of a new pressure -based MRI -safe pain tolerance device One of the barriers to studying the behavioral and emotional effects of pain using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is the absence of a commercially available, MRI - compatible, pressure -based algometer to elicit pain. The present study sought to address this barrier through creation and validation of a novel MRI -safe apparatus capable of delivering incremental, measurable amounts of pressure inside a scanning bore. We introduced an MR-safe device used to administer pressure -based pain. To test against a commercially available, MRI - incompatible algometer (AlgoMed), 199 participants reported their pain tolerance for both devices. A second experiment tested the validity of pressure -based pain in an MRI environment by comparing brain activation with established neural networks for pain. 10 participants performed an identical procedure to test for pain tolerance while being scanned in a 7T MRI scanner. Results support the validity and reliability of our novel device. In Study 1, pain tolerance with this device was strongly correlated with pain tolerance as measured by a commercially available algometer (r=0.78). In Study 2, this device yielded BOLD activation within the insula (BA 13) and anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24); as pressure increased, activation in these areas parametrically increased. These findings correspond to other studies using thermal, electrical, or mechanical pain applications. Behavioral and functional data demonstrate that this new device is a valid method of administering pressure -related pain in MRI environments. Our novel MRI -safe device is a valid instrument to measure and administer pressure -based pain.",
  "27939879": "Trends in Adolescent Overweight Perception and Its Association With Psychosomatic Health 2002-2014: Evidence From 33 Countries Perceiving oneself as overweight is common and strongly associated with adolescents' subjective well-being. The prevalence of overweight perceptions and their impact on well-being may have increased over the past decade due to an increase in the salience of weight-related issues. This study examines trends (2002-2014) in the prevalence of adolescent overweight perceptions and their association with psychosomatic complaints. Data from 15-year-old adolescents were obtained between 2002 and 2014 in four rounds of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study in 33 countries in Europe and North America (N = 187,511). Design-adjusted logistic regressions were used to quantify changes in overweight perceptions over time. Linear modeling was used to assess change in the association between perceived overweight and self-reported psychosomatic complaint burden, adjusting for overweight status. Among boys, 10 of 33 countries saw an increase in overweight perceptions between 2002 and 2014, with Russia, Estonia, and Latvia showing the most pronounced year-on-year increases. Only England, France, Germany, and Norway saw an increase in the positive association between overweight perceptions and psychosomatic complaints among boys. Among girls, most countries (28/33) saw no change in the prevalence of overweight perceptions, with the prevalence over 40% in most nations. However, in 12 countries, the association between overweight perceptions and psychosomatic complaints increased among girls, with particularly strong changes seen in Scotland and Norway. Evidence is presented which suggests that for adolescent girls in 12 Northern and Western European countries and for boys in four perceiving oneself as overweight may be increasingly deleterious for psychosomatic health.",
  "27659602": "The Aortic Root: Natural History After Root-Sparing Ascending Replacement in Nonsyndromic Aneurysmal Patients Leaving native aortic tissue in situ in root-sparing ascending aortic replacement raises concern regarding potential later need for root reoperation or for the potential occurrence of localized dissections or rupture in the residual root. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the natural growth of the aortic root after root-sparing aortic replacement. In all, 102 consecutive patients (mean age 61.8 ± 12.5 years; 60% male) who had undergone root-sparing aortic replacement had sufficient retrievable information regarding their aortic root diameter at postoperative baseline and follow-up imaging by computed tomography or echocardiography. The annual growth rate was evaluated and also compared according to the influence of valve morphology and concomitant aortic valve replacement. Furthermore, the years of natural history that would require for root enlargement to meet a 50 mm threshold of the root diameter were calculated. The estimated growth rate of the aortic root after root-sparing aortic replacement is between 0.27 and 0.51 mm per year (mean 0.41 mm, varying according to the underlying diameter) and therefore fivefold less than other aortic regions. Accordingly, a root aneurysm indicating reoperation would not be expected for 29.1 years on average. Only patients with a diameter of 45 mm or more are at risk for reoperation, and not until at least after 10.4 years have passed. Neither the valve morphology (p = 0.62) nor concomitant aortic valve replacement (p = 0.86) influenced rate of root dilation. In nonsyndromic patients, the aortic root is the slowest growing portion of the thoracic aorta. Leaving the native root, as in root-sparing ascending aortic replacement, is a safe approach regarding secondary root intervention for aortic root diameters of 45 mm or less.",
  "27580908": "Assessing the learning potential of an interactive digital game versus an interactive-style didactic lecture: the continued importance of didactic teaching in medical student education Games with educational intent offer a possible advantage of being more interactive and increasing learner satisfaction. We conducted a two-armed experiment to evaluate student satisfaction and content mastery for an introductory pediatric radiology topic, taught by either an interactive digital game or with a traditional didactic lecture. Medical students participating in a fourth-year radiology elective were invited to participate. Student cohorts were alternatively given a faculty - supervised 1h session playing a simple interactive digital Tic-tac-toe quiz module on pediatric gastrointestinal radiology or a 1h didactic introductory lecture on the same topic. Survey questions assessed the learners' perceived ability to recall the material as well as their satisfaction with the educational experience. Results of an end-of-rotation exam were reviewed to evaluate a quantitative measure of learning between groups. Survey responses were analyzed with a chi-squared test. Exam results for both groups were analyzed with a paired Student's t-test. Students in the lecture group had higher test scores compared to students in the game group (4.0/5 versus 3.6/5, P = 0.045). Students in the lecture group reported greater understanding and recall of the material than students in the game group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). Students in the lecture group perceived the lecture to be more enjoyable and a better use of their time compared to those in the game group (P = 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the lecture and game group in ability to maintain interest (P = 0.187). In comparison to pre-survey results, there was a statistically significant decrease in interest for further digital interactive materials reported by students in the game group (P = 0.146). Our experience supported the use of a traditional lecture over a digital game module. While these results might be affected by the specific lecture and digital content in any given comparison, a digital module is not always the superior option.",
  "27484604": "Evaluation of Spontaneous Bone Regeneration after Enucleation of Large Cysts of the Jaws using Radiographic Computed Software Spontaneous regeneration of bone is commonly seen in the small surgical defects caused by enucleation of cysts. However, in case of large surgical defects caused by the enucleation, spontaneous regeneration of bone is a rare phenomenon and it depends on factors, such as age of the patient, intact periosteum, and proper stabilization. The study included 16 patients, who reported to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery with the complaint of pain and swelling in the jaws diagnosed as cyst. The sample included equal numbers of male and female subjects aged between 15 and 40 years. Panoramic radiographs were taken pre- and postoperatively on day 2 of the enucleation. The dimensions of the cyst were evaluated on the radiograph according to the proforma. Subsequent radiographs were taken at regular intervals of 1.5, 3, and 6 months using standard parameters and were analyzed using MCID™ analysis software of imaging research. Mean reduction was seen in up to 39 and 60% in the cystic cavity size and increase in the mean density up to 59 and 90.2% at 3 and 6 months intervals respectively. Spontaneous bone regeneration was seen even after primary closure of the large cystic defect without the need for placement of foreign substances or grafts and it also eliminated the complications resulting from placement of foreign substance. Further studies are required in a larger sample with longer follow-up durations to confirm the outcome of the present work for the benefit of patients. The present study depicted that spontaneous bone regeneration can occur with accepted results after simple enucleation of jaw cyst without the aid of any graft material. Hence, simple enucleation may be considered as a first line of treatment modality for cystic lesion of the jaws. This simplifies the surgical procedure, decreases the economic and biologic costs, and reduces the risk of postoperative complications. Follow-up is necessary along with patient's compliance for the success of treatment.",
  "27997759": "Down-regulation of cladofulvin biosynthesis is required for biotrophic growth of Cladosporium fulvum on tomato Fungal biotrophy is associated with a reduced capacity to produce potentially toxic secondary metabolites (SMs). Yet, the genome of the biotrophic plant pathogen Cladosporium fulvum contains many SM biosynthetic gene clusters, with several related to toxin production. These gene clusters are, however, poorly expressed during the colonization of tomato. The sole detectable SM produced by C. fulvum during in vitro growth is the anthraquinone cladofulvin. Although this pigment is not detected in infected leaves, cladofulvin biosynthetic genes are expressed throughout the pre-penetration phase and during conidiation at the end of the infection cycle, but are repressed during the biotrophic phase of tomato colonization. It has been suggested that the tight regulation of SM gene clusters is required for C. fulvum to behave as a biotrophic pathogen, whilst retaining potential fitness determinants for growth and survival outside its host. To address this hypothesis, we analysed the disease symptoms caused by mutant C. fulvum strains that do not produce or over-produce cladofulvin during the biotrophic growth phase. Non-producers infected tomato in a similar manner to the wild-type, suggesting that cladofulvin is not a virulence factor. In contrast, the cladofulvin over-producers caused strong necrosis and desiccation of tomato leaves, which, in turn, arrested conidiation. Consistent with the role of pigments in survival against abiotic stresses, cladofulvin protects conidia against UV light and low-temperature stress. Overall, this study demonstrates that the repression of cladofulvin production is required for C. fulvum to sustain its biotrophic lifestyle in tomato, whereas its production is important for survival outside its host.",

CSCs contribute to drug-resistance, cancer recurrence and metastasis, thus development of CSC -targeted therapeutic strategies has recently received significant attention in cancer research. In this study, the potential efficacy of renieramycin M (RM) isolated from the sponge Xestospongia species, was examined against lung CSCs. Colony and spheroid formation assays, as well as western blotting analysis of lung CSC protein markers were employed to determine the CSC -like phenotypes of H460 lung cancer cells after treatment with RM at non-toxic concentrations. RM treatment reduced significantly colony and spheroid formation of H460 cells. Moreover, the CSC markers CD133, CD44 and ALDH1A1 of CSC -enriched H460 cells were reduced significantly following RM treatment. RM could be a potent anti-metastatic agent by suppressing lung CSC -like phenotypes in H460 cells.",

A pilot project involving fingerprint -based criminal history background checks for personal care workers in Michigan has supplied an opportunity to examine one such mechanism. In conjunction with the pilot project, we have conducted a stakeholder analysis with the aim of informing decision makers about stakeholder perceptions of standard policy criteria like effectiveness, efficiency, and equity. We employed focus groups and a web-based survey to collect data from stakeholders. While stakeholders generally see fingerprint -based background checks for personal care workers as potentially effective and as a net benefit, they also point to a variety of contingencies. They also recognize difficulties and constraints for government involvement. This preliminary analysis provides solid foundational information for decision makers and for more extensive benefit-cost analysis.",
  "28113347": "NEMo: An Evolutionary Model With Modularity for PPI Networks Modeling the evolution of biological networks is a major challenge. Biological networks are usually represented as graphs; evolutionary events not only include addition and removal of vertices and edges but also duplication of vertices and their associated edges. Since duplication is viewed as a primary driver of genomic evolution, recent work has focused on duplication -based models. Missing from these models is any embodiment of modularity, a widely accepted attribute of biological networks. Some models spontaneously generate modular structures, but none is known to maintain and evolve them. We describe network evolution with modularity (NEMo), a new model that embodies modularity. NEMo allows modules to appear and disappear and to fission and to merge, all driven by the underlying edge-level events using a duplication -based process. We also introduce measures to compare biological networks in terms of their modular structure; we present comparisons between NEMo and existing duplication -based models and run our measuring tools on both generated and published networks.",
  "27405997": "Vestibular ablation and a semicircular canal prosthesis affect postural stability during head turns In our study, we examined postural stability during head turns for two rhesus monkeys: one animal study contrasted normal and mild bilateral vestibular ablation and a second animal study contrasted severe bilateral vestibular ablation with and without prosthetic stimulation. The monkeys freely stood, unrestrained on a balance platform and made voluntary head turns between visual targets. To quantify each animals ' posture, motions of the head and trunk, as well as torque about the body's center of mass, were measured. In the mildly ablated animal, we observed less foretrunk sway in comparison with the normal state. When the canal prosthesis provided electric stimulation to the severely ablated animal, it showed a decrease in trunk sway during head turns. Because the rhesus monkey with severe bilateral vestibular loss exhibited a decrease in trunk sway when receiving vestibular prosthetic stimulation, we propose that the prosthetic electrical stimulation partially restored head velocity information. Our results provide an indication that a semicircular canal prosthesis may be an effective way to improve postural stability in patients with severe peripheral vestibular dysfunction.",
  "27871298": "Socioeconomic variation in incidence of primary and secondary major cardiovascular disease events: an Australian population-based prospective cohort study Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affects disadvantaged people, but reliable quantitative evidence on socioeconomic variation in CVD incidence in Australia is lacking. This study aimed to quantify socioeconomic variation in rates of primary and secondary CVD events in mid- age and older Australians. Baseline data (2006-2009) from the 45 and Up Study, an Australian cohort involving 267,153 men and women aged ≥ 45, were linked to hospital and death data (to December 2013). Outcomes comprised first event - death or hospital admission - for major CVD combined, as well as myocardial infarction and stroke, in those with and without prior CVD (secondary and primary events, respectively). Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for each outcome in relation to education (and income and area-level disadvantage), separately by age group (45-64, 65-79, and ≥ 80 years), adjusting for age and sex, and additional sociodemographic factors. There were 18,207 primary major CVD events over 1,144,845 years of follow-up (15.9/1000 person-years), and 20,048 secondary events over 260,357 years (77.0/1000 person-years). For both primary and secondary events, incidence increased with decreasing education, with the absolute difference between education groups largest for secondary events. Age - sex adjusted hazard ratios were highest in the 45-64 years group: for major CVD s, HR (no qualifications vs university degree) = 1.62 (95% CI: 1.49-1.77) for primary events, and HR = 1.49 (1.34-1.65) for secondary events; myocardial infarction HR = 2.31 (1.87-2.85) and HR = 2.57 (1.90-3.47) respectively; stroke HR = 1.48 (1.16-1.87) and HR = 1.97 (1.42-2.74) respectively. Similar but attenuated results were seen in older age groups, and with income. For area-level disadvantage, CVD gradients were weak and non-significant in older people (> 64 years). Individual-level data are important for quantifying socioeconomic variation in CVD incidence, which is shown to be substantial among both those with and without prior CVD. Findings reinforce the opportunity for, and importance of, primary and secondary prevention and treatment in reducing socioeconomic variation in CVD and consequently the overall burden of CVD morbidity and mortality in Australia.",
  "27748824": "Cardiovascular diseases related to ionizing radiation: The risk of low - dose exposure (Review) Traditionally, non-cancer diseases are not considered as health risks following exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation. Indeed, non-cancer diseases are classified as deterministic tissue reactions, which are characterized by a threshold dose. It is judged that below an absorbed dose of 100 mGy, no clinically relevant tissue damage occurs, forming the basis for the current radiation protection system concerning non-cancer effects. Recent epidemiological findings point, however, to an excess risk of non-cancer diseases following exposure to lower doses of ionizing radiation than was previously thought. The evidence is the most sound for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cataract. Due to limited statistical power, the dose - risk relationship is undetermined below 0.5 Gy; however, if this relationship proves to be without a threshold, it may have considerable impact on current low ‑ dose health risk estimates. In this review, we describe the CVD risk related to low doses of ionizing radiation, the clinical manifestation and the pathology of radiation-induced CVD, as well as the importance of the endothelium models in CVD research as a way forward to complement the epidemiological data with the underlying biological and molecular mechanisms.",
  "27806383": "Transplacental Passage of Acetaminophen in Term Pregnancy Objective The objective of this study was to determine the maternal and fetal pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of acetaminophen after administration of a therapeutic oral dose. Study Design After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval and their written informed consent, pregnant women were given a single oral dose (1,000 mg) of acetaminophen upon admission for scheduled cesarean delivery. Maternal venous blood and fetal cord blood were obtained at the time of delivery and acetaminophen levels were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. PK parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. Nonparametric correlation of maternal / fetal acetaminophen levels and PK curves were calculated. Results In this study, 34 subjects were enrolled (median, 32 years; range, 25-39 years). The median maternal weight was 82 kg (range, 62-100 kg). All but two subjects were delivered beyond 39 weeks' gestation. The median newborn birth weight was 3,590 g (interquartile range, 3,403-3,848 g). Noncompartmental analysis described similar PK parameters in the maternal (T1/2, 84 minutes; apparent clearance [Cl/F], 28.8 L/h; apparent volume of distribution [Vd/F], 57.5 L) and fetal compartments (T1/2, 82 minutes; Cl/F, 31.2 L/h; Vd/F, 61.2 L). Paired maternal / fetal acetaminophen levels were highly correlated (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Fetal acetaminophen PKs in the fetus parallels that in the mother suggesting that placental transfer is flow limited. Maternal acetaminophen levels can be used as a surrogate for fetal exposure.",
  "28213871": "Thieno[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives: a new class of antiviral drugs against Mayaro virus Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an arthropod-borne virus and a member of the family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus. Its infection leads to an acute illness accompanied by long-lasting arthralgia. To date, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines against infection with MAYV and resources for the prevention or treatment of other alphaviruses are very limited. MAYV has served as a model to study the antiviral potential of several substances on alphavirus replication. In this work we evaluated the antiviral effect of seven new derivatives of thieno[2,3-b]pyridine against MAYV replication in a mammalian cell line. All derivatives were able to reduce viral production effectively at concentrations that were non-toxic for Vero cells. Molecular modeling assays predicted low toxicity risk and good oral bioavailability of the substances in humans. One of the molecules, selected for further study, demonstrated a strong anti-MAYV effect at early stages of replication, as it protected pre-treated cells and also during the late stages, affecting virus morphogenesis. This study is the first to demonstrate the antiviral effect of thienopyridine derivatives on MAYV replication in vitro, suggesting the potential application of these substances as antiviral molecules against alphaviruses. Additional in vivo research will be needed to expand the putative therapeutic applications.",
  "27798219": "Impact of antibiotic de-escalation on clinical outcomes in community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia Although antibiotic de-escalation is regarded as a measure that reduces selection pressure, adverse drug effects and costs, evidence supporting this practice in community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia (CAPP) is lacking. We carried out a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of a cohort of hospitalized adults with CAPP. Pneumococcal aetiology was established in patients with one or more positive cultures for Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained from blood, sterile fluids or sputum, and/or a positive urinary antigen test. De-escalation therapy was considered when the initial antibiotic therapy was narrowed to penicillin, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate within the first 72 h after admission. The primary outcomes were 30 day mortality and length of hospital stay (LOS). Adjustment for confounders was performed with multivariate and propensity score analyses. Of 1410 episodes of CAPP, antibiotic de-escalation within the first 72 h after admission was performed in 166 cases. After adjustment, antibiotic de-escalation was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.24-2.81), but it was found to be a protective factor for prolonged LOS (above the median) (OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.30-0.70). Similar results were found in patients classified into high-risk pneumonia severity index classes (IV-V), those with clinical instability and those with bacteraemia. No significant differences were documented in adverse drug reactions or readmission (<30 days). Antibiotic de-escalation seems to be safe and effective in reducing the duration of LOS, and did not adversely affect outcomes of patients with CAPP, even those with bacteraemia and severe disease, and those who were clinically unstable.",
  "28545358": "Molecular Imaging of Tumor Angiogenesis and Therapeutic Effects with Dual Bioluminescence Angiogenesis is critical for the growth of tumor by supplying nutrients and oxygen that exacerbates the metastasis and progression of cancer. Noninvasive imaging of angiogenesis during the tumor therapeutic processes may provide novel opportunities for image-guided tumor management. Here, we want to develop a mouse animal model for assessing cancer progression and angiogenesis in the same individuals by molecular imaging. Breast cancer model was developed with mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 carrying a reporter system encoding a triple fusion (TF) reporter gene consisting of renilla luciferase (Rluc), red fluorescent protein (RFP) and herpes simplex virus truncated thymidine kinase (HSV-ttk) in transgenic mice, which expressed firefly luciferase (Fluc) under the promoter of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (Vegfr2-luc). The mice were subsequently treated with ganciclovir (GCV) and the tumor angiogenesis was tracked by Fluc imaging and the growth status of tumor was monitored by imaging of Rluc simultaneously. Overall, this traceable breast cancer model can simultaneously image the tumor growth and angiogenesis in single individual, which may facilitate a better understanding the mechanisms of angiogenesis in the progression and regression of tumor.",
  "27306647": "Delayed progression of rabies transmitted by a vampire bat Here, we compared the growth kinetics, cell-to-cell spread, and virus internalization kinetics in N2a cells of RABV variants isolated from vampire bats (V-3), domestic dogs (V-2) and marmosets (V-M) as well as the clinical symptoms and mortality caused by these variants. The replication rate of V-3 was significantly higher than those of V-2 and V-M. However, the uptake and spread of these RABV variants into N2a cells were inversely proportional. Nevertheless, V-3 had longer incubation and evolution periods. Our results provide evidence that the clinical manifestations of infection with bat RABV variant occur at a later time when compared to what was observed with canine and marmoset rabies virus variants.",
  "27872234": "Downregulation of Endothelial Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Type 4 Channel and Small-Conductance of Ca2+-Activated K+ Channels Underpins Impaired Endothelium-Dependent Hyperpolarization in Hypertension Endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (EDH)-mediated responses are impaired in hypertension, but the underlying mechanisms have not yet been determined. The activation of small- and intermediate-conductance of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (SKCa and IKCa) underpins EDH -mediated responses. It was recently reported that Ca(2+) influx through endothelial transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 channel (TRPV4) is a prerequisite for the activation of SKCa / IKCa in endothelial cells in specific beds. Here, we attempted to determine whether the impairment of EDH in hypertension is attributable to the dysfunction of TRPV4 and S / IKCa, using isolated superior mesenteric arteries of 20-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In the WKY arteries, EDH -mediated responses were reduced by a combination of SKCa / IKCa blockers (apamin plus TRAM-34; 1-[(2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethl]-1H-pyrazole) and by the blockade of TRPV4 with the selective antagonist RN-1734 or HC-067047. In the SHRSP arteries, EDH-mediated hyperpolarization and relaxation were significantly impaired when compared with WKY. GSK1016790A, a selective TRPV4 activator, evoked robust hyperpolarization and relaxation in WKY arteries. In contrast, in SHRSP arteries, the GSK1016790A -evoked hyperpolarization was small and relaxation was absent. Hyperpolarization and relaxation to cyclohexyl-[2-(3,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-1-yl)-6-methyl-pyrimidin-4-yl]-amine, a selective SKCa activator, were marginally decreased in SHRSP arteries compared with WKY arteries. The expression of endothelial TRPV4 and SKCa protein was significantly decreased in the SHRSP mesenteric arteries compared with those of WKY, whereas function and expression of IKCa were preserved in SHRSP arteries. These findings suggest that EDH -mediated responses are impaired in superior mesenteric arteries of SHRSP because of a reduction in both TRPV4 and SKCa input to EDH.",
  "27565266": "Considering Cost-Effectiveness in Cardiology Clinical Guidelines: Progress and Prospects Since the 1980s, when the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) established a joint task force to examine the use of cardiovascular procedures and therapies, cardiologists have been leaders in the development of clinical practice guidelines. The ACC/AHA guidelines development process has evolved considerably over the last 30 or more years. Guidelines now focus on clinical conditions, such as angina, instead of procedures, such as bypass surgery. There is a formal organizational structure, with dedicated staff, a standing committee on practice guidelines, and specific panels of volunteer experts on each topic. This process tightly manages conflicts of interest and strives for evidence-based, as opposed to opinion-based, guidelines, with a clear citation of the supporting evidence. Traditional clinical guidelines consider only what is best for the individual patient, and have explicitly not considered the cost to society. Nevertheless, in many guidelines development meetings, high cost was implicitly considered: if a procedure was extremely costly, the evidence needed to be very strong. The Guidelines Committee recognized that cost considerations ought to be made more transparent, and that the evidence on economic value should be explicitly cited when available. These considerations were formalized by a recent white paper on incorporating economic considerations into ACC/AHA guidelines. In considering value, it is necessary to assess the quality of the evidence as well as to define levels of value. The next ACC/AHA guideline will incorporate value as a part of its recommendations. This will be an evidence-based process in which published economic assessments relating to key questions will be reviewed.",
  "27507702": "Transcriptome sequencing and de novo characterization of Korean endemic land snail, Koreanohadra kurodana for functional transcripts and SSR markers The Korean endemic land snail Koreanohadra kurodana (Gastropoda: Bradybaenidae) found in humid areas of broadleaf forests and shrubs have been considered vulnerable as the number of individuals are declining in recent years. The species is poorly characterized at the genomic level that limits the understanding of functions at the molecular and genetics level. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcript dataset of visceral mass tissue of K. kurodana by the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Over 234 million quality reads were assembled to a total of 315,924 contigs and 191,071 unigenes, with an average and N50 length of 585.6 and 715 bp and 678 and 927 bp, respectively. Overall, 36.32 % of the unigenes found matches to known protein / nucleotide sequences in the public databases. The direction of the unigenes to functional categories was determined using COG, GO, KEGG, and InterProScan protein domain search. The GO analysis search resulted in 22,967 unigenes (12.02 %) being categorized into 40 functional groups. The KEGG annotation revealed that metabolism pathway genes were enriched. The most prominent protein motifs include the zinc finger, ribonuclease H, reverse transcriptase, and ankyrin repeat domains. The simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified from >1 kb length of unigenes show a dominancy of dinucleotide repeat motifs followed with tri- and tetranucleotide motifs. A number of unigenes were putatively assessed to belong to adaptation and defense mechanisms including heat shock proteins 70, Toll-like receptor 4, AMP-activated protein kinase, aquaporin-2, etc. Our data provide a rich source for the identification and functional characterization of new genes and candidate polymorphic SSR markers in K. kurodana. The availability of transcriptome information (http://bioinfo.sch.ac.kr/submission/) would promote the utilization of the resources for phylogenetics study and genetic diversity assessment.",
  "28127757": "Donor bone marrow cells are essential for iNKT cell -mediated Foxp3 + Treg cell expansion in a murine model of transplantation tolerance Mixed chimerism induction is the most reliable method for establishing transplantation tolerance. We previously described a novel treatment using a suboptimal dose of anti-CD40 ligand (anti-CD40L) and liposomal formulation of a ligand for invariant natural killer T cells administered to sub-lethally irradiated recipient mice after donor bone marrow cell (BMC) transfer. Recipient mice treated with this regimen showed expansion of a Foxp3 -positive regulatory T(Treg) cell phenotype, and formation of mixed chimera. However, the mechanism of expansion and bioactivity of Treg cells remains unclear. Here, we examine the role of donor BMCs in the expansion of bioactive Treg cells. The mouse model was transplanted with a heart allograft the day after treatment. The results showed that transfer of spleen cells in place of BMCs failed to deplete host interferon (IFN)-γ -producing CD8(+) T cells, expand host Ki67(+) CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells, and prolong graft survival. Severe combined immunodeficiency mice who received Treg cells obtained from BMC-recipients accepted skin grafts in an allo-specific manner. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which were a copious cell subset in BMCs, enhanced the Ki67 expression of Treg cells. This suggests that donor BMCs are indispensable for the expansion of host bioactive Treg cells in our novel treatment for transplant tolerance induction.",
  "28466270": "Synaptic NMDA Receptor Activation Induces Ubiquitination and Degradation of STEP61 NMDA receptor signaling is critical for the development of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, and dysregulation of NMDAR signaling is implicated in a number of neurological disorders including schizophrenia (SZ). Previous work has demonstrated that the STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase 61 kDa (STEP61) is elevated in human SZ postmortem cortical samples and after administration of psychotomimetics to cultures or mice. Here, we report that activation of synaptic NMDAR by bicuculline or D-serine results in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of STEP61, and increased surface localization of GluN1 / GluN2B receptors. Moreover, bicuculline or D-serine treatments rescue the motor and cognitive deficits in MK-801 -treated mice and reduce STEP61 in mouse frontal cortex. These results suggest that STEP61 may contribute to the therapeutic effects of D-serine.",
  "27441638": "Potentiation of LPS - Induced Apoptotic Cell Death in Human Hepatoma HepG2 Cells by Aspirin via ROS and Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Protection by N-Acetyl Cysteine Cytotoxicity and inflammation - associated toxic responses have been observed to be induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in vitro and in vivo respectively. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, has been reported to be beneficial in inflammation - associated diseases like cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Their precise molecular mechanisms, however, are not clearly understood. Our previous studies on aspirin treated HepG2 cells strongly suggest cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In the present study, we have further demonstrated that HepG2 cells treated with LPS alone or in combination with aspirin induces subcellular toxic responses which are accompanied by increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and apoptosis. The LPS / Aspirin induced toxicity was attenuated by pre-treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Alterations in oxidative stress and glutathione - dependent redox-homeostasis were more pronounced in mitochondria compared to extra - mitochondrial cellular compartments. Pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with NAC exhibited a selective protection in redox homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results suggest that the altered redox metabolism, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in HepG2 cells play a critical role in LPS / aspirin - induced cytotoxicity. These results may help in better understanding the pharmacological, toxicological and therapeutic properties of NSAIDs in cancer cells exposed to bacterial endotoxins.",

On full workup, he was diagnosed with an advanced cancer of the pancreas. It was an aggressive, highly treatment resistant cancer, with an alarmingly poor prognosis. Before the diagnosis had been made, the family had informed our team that we were not to discuss medical issues with Mr X directly, and that upon arriving on a diagnosis we were to come to them first and they would subsequently inform him. They reported that Mr X was in support of this arrangement. Eventually we told the family about Mr X's diagnosis, and they asserted their collective will to keep this information from him, reaffirming that all medical discussion go through them. However, the doctor in charge explained the diagnosis to Mr X using an interpreter while his family were away from his bed. In this discussion, I consider this case from the perspective of respecting patients' and families' preferences around medical treatment and care.",

Important lipogenic enzymes like glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) show subcellular distribution pattern. Activity of G-6-PDH was largely restricted to cytosolic fraction while MDH was found in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction in Gastrothylax indicus. Following in vitro treatment with ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Punica granatum fruit peel and commercial anthelmintic, albendazole G-6-PDH activity was decreased by 19-32 %, whereas MDH was suppressed by 24-41 %, compared to the respective control. Albendazole was quite effective when compared with negative control and both the extracts. The results indicate that phytochemicals of plant may act as potential vermifuge or vermicide.",
  "27613509": "Improved individualized prediction of schizophrenia in subjects at familial high risk, based on neuroanatomical data, schizotypal and neurocognitive features To date, there are no reliable markers for predicting onset of schizophrenia in individuals at high risk (HR). Substantial promise is, however, shown by a variety of pattern classification approaches to neuroimaging data. Here, we examined the predictive accuracy of support vector machine (SVM) in later diagnosing schizophrenia, at a single-subject level, using a cohort of HR individuals drawn from multiply affected families and a combination of neuroanatomical, schizotypal and neurocognitive variables. Baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), schizotypal and neurocognitive data from 17 HR subjects, who subsequently developed schizophrenia and a matched group of 17 HR subjects who did not make the transition, yet had psychotic symptoms, were included in the analysis. We employed recursive feature elimination (RFE), in a nested cross-validation scheme to identify the most significant predictors of disease transition and enhance diagnostic performance. Classification accuracy was 94% when a self-completed measure of schizotypy, a declarative memory test and structural MRI data were combined into a single learning algorithm; higher than when either quantitative measure was used alone. The discriminative neuroanatomical pattern involved gray matter volume differences in frontal, orbito-frontal and occipital lobe regions bilaterally as well as parts of the superior, medial temporal lobe and cerebellar regions. Our findings suggest that an early SVM -based prediction of schizophrenia is possible and can be improved by combining schizotypal and neurocognitive features with neuroanatomical variables. However, our predictive model needs to be tested by classifying a new, independent HR cohort in order to estimate its validity.",

All thrombotic events were classified as endovenous heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT). Thrombus was observed in 27 stumps (87.1%), with only four (12.9%) stumps remaining without thrombus on postoperative day 6. Thrombus as EHIT class 2 was observed in one stump and as EHIT class 3 in another; in the remaining 25 stumps, it was observed as EHIT class 1 postoperatively. No further extension of thrombus was found at 4 and 16 weeks after surgery. The rate of thrombus formation in the proximal stump of the saphenous vein after conventional surgery is comparatively higher than that after thermoablation techniques. Further studies are required to determine adequate evaluation methods and appropriate therapies for stump thrombosis after varicose vein surgery.

Fed-batch immobilized cultures with A. succinogenes in alginates resulted in higher sugar to succinic acid conversion yield (0.81g/g) than the respective yield achieved (0.65g/g) when DCM immobilized cultures were used. The final succinic acid concentration and yield achieved in fed-batch with immobilized cultures of B. succiniciproducens in alginates (45g/L and 0.66g/g) were higher than A. succinogenes immobilized cultures (35.4g/L and 0.61g/g) using nano - filtrated SSL as fermentation medium. Immobilized cultures of B. succiniciproducens in alginate beads were reused in four sequential fed-batch fermentations of nano - filtrated SSL leading to the production of 64.7g of succinic acid with a yield range of 0.42-0.67g/g and productivity range of 0.29-0.65g/L/h.

Despite this, violations of professional conduct are common. We sought to explore professional behaviors specific to appropriate use of technology by looking at changes in third-year medical students' attitudes and behaviors at the beginning and conclusion of their clinical clerkships. After formal teaching about digital professionalism, we administered a survey to medical students that described 35 technology - related behaviors and queried students about professionalism of the behavior (on a 5-point Likert scale), observation of others engaging in the behavior (yes or no), as well as personal participation in the behavior (yes or no). Students were resurveyed at the end of the academic year. Over the year, perceptions of what is considered acceptable behavior regarding privacy, data security, communications, and social media boundaries changed, despite formal teaching sessions to reinforce professional behavior. Furthermore, medical students who observed unprofessional behaviors were more likely to participate in such behaviors. Although technology is a useful tool to enhance teaching and learning, our results reflect an erosion of professionalism related to information security that occurred despite medical school and hospital -based teaching sessions to promote digital professionalism. True alteration of trainee behavior will require a cultural shift that includes continual education, better role models, and frequent reminders for faculty, house staff, students, and staff.",

Recently, secretion of inducible cytokines and growth factors from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been discovered, and we also have reported the osteogenic effects of cell physical stimulation. In this study, we investigated the effects of hABMSCs - conditioned secretion media (B-CSM) on osteogenic differentiation of hABMSCs in vitro. Furthermore, we analyzed the B-CSM by proteomics array to identify inducible factors which facilitate osteogenic differentiation. To determine optimal concentration, B-CSM was firstly added at varying amounts (5, 10, 20, 40, and 60%) relative to culture medium. The viability and proliferation of hABMSCs were higher after treating with 5-20% B-CSM to the cells, compared to 40-60%. In addition, the expression of stem cells markers CD146 and STRO-1 was increased in the cells treated with 5-20% B-CSM, but decreased with 40-60%. We also found that B-CSM promoted osteogenic differentiation of hABMSCs such as mineralized nodules were strongly generated by 5-20%. B-CSM was most effective in increasing the expression of Vinculin and osteocalcin (OCN) in osteogenic differentiation of hABMSCs. Taken together, the results of our study ultimately indicate that B-CSM from hABMSCs induced by physical stimulation induce the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hABMSCs.",

We also aimed to evaluate predictors and potential clinical associates of these collaterals. Methods Coronary angiograms of 83 consecutive CTEPH patients who had undergone coronary angiography before PEA operation between January 1, 2012 and June 1, 2015 were retrospectively evaluated for presence of coronary artery - pulmonary artery collaterals. Medical records of all patients were also retrospectively reviewed for demographic information, cardiovascular risk factors, preoperative right heart catheterization reports, operation reports, and follow-up data. Data of CTEPH patients with coronary artery - pulmonary artery collaterals were compared with data of CTEPH patients without such collaterals. Results There were 15 patients (18.1%) with definite and 4 patients (4.8%) with probable coronary artery - pulmonary artery collaterals among the study population. CTEPH patients with collaterals had higher preoperative pulmonary artery pressures, higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and lower cardiac index values compared with CTEPH patients without collaterals. However, CTEPH patients with collaterals displayed higher amount of reduction in PVR after PEA compared with patients without collaterals. There were no significant differences between groups regarding incidence of reperfusion injury or mortality. Conclusion Prevalence of coronary artery - pulmonary artery collaterals seems to be increased in our CTEPH patients compared with the general population. The presence of coronary artery - pulmonary artery collaterals is often combined with proximal disease with the possibility of increased reduction of PVR after PEA operation.",

Total aerobic mesophilic bacteria counts exceeded the acceptability limit at d 7 in the control group without MAP (AIR), and at d 19 in MAP and OS containing samples. OS utilization resulted in around 1.5 and 1.0 log unit reductions in Pseudomonas spp. counts at d 7 and d 10 of storage, respectively, as compared with AIR and MAP groups (P < 0.05). MAP and OS groups had fewer (P < 0.05) coliform counts than did the AIR group, with an approximately 1.0 log reduction observed at d 10. Although in some cases OS utilization resulted in lower TBARS values and carbonyl and sulphydryl contents, particularly during later stages of refrigerated storage as compared to AIR and MAP groups, in general, these effects were not always apparent. The results of this study suggested that MAP suppressed microbiological growth and retarded lipid and protein oxidation in chicken thigh meats, with a 9- day shelf-life extention with insignificant effects of OS.",

The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiographic bone level assessment to intra-surgical bone level registration (1) and to identify the clinical variables rendering interdental bone level assessment inaccurate (2). The study sample included 49 interdental sites in 17 periodontitis patients. Evaluation methods included vertical relative probing attachment level (RAL-V), analogue and digital intra-oral radiography and bone sounding without and with flap elevation. The latter was considered the true bone level. Five examiners evaluated all radiographs. Significant underestimation of the true bone level was observed for all evaluation methods pointing to 2.7 mm on average for analogue radiography, 2.5 mm for digital radiography, 1.8 mm for RAL-V and 0.6 mm for bone sounding without flap elevation (p < 0.001). Radiographic underestimation of the true bone level was higher in the (pre)molar region (p ≤ 0.047) and increased with defect depth (p < 0.001). Variation between clinicians was huge (range analogue radiography 2.2-3.2 mm; range digital radiography 2.1-3.0 mm). All evaluation methods significantly underestimated the true bone level. Bone sounding was most accurate, whereas intra-oral radiographs were least accurate. Deep periodontal defects in the (pre)molar region were most underrated by intra-oral radiography. Bone sounding had the highest accuracy in assessing interdental bone level.",

Clinical Relevance for Quality Improvement Visualization can reduce the cognitive load of information, allowing users to easily interpret and assess large amounts of data. The purpose of our study was to examine home health data using visual analysis techniques to discover clinically salient associations between patient characteristics with problem-oriented health outcomes of older adult home health patients during the home health service period. Knowledge, Behavior and Status ratings at discharge as well as change from admission to discharge that was coded using the Omaha System was collected from a dataset on 988 de-identified patient data from 15 home health agencies. SPSS Visualization Designer v1.0 was used to visually analyze patterns between independent and outcome variables using heat maps and histograms. Visualizations suggesting clinical salience were tested for significance using correlation analysis. The mean age of the patients was 80 years, with the majority female (66%). Of the 150 visualizations, 69 potentially meaningful patterns were statistically evaluated through bivariate associations, revealing 21 significant associations. Further, 14 associations between episode length and Charlson co-morbidity index mainly with urinary related diagnoses and problems remained significant after adjustment analyses. Through visual analysis, the adverse association of the longer home health episode length and higher Charlson co-morbidity index with behavior or status outcomes for patients with impaired urinary function was revealed. We have demonstrated the use of visual analysis to discover novel patterns that described high-needs subgroups among the older home health patient population. The effective presentation of these data patterns can allow clinicians to identify areas of patient improvement, and time periods that are most effective for implementing home health interventions to improve patient outcomes.",

However, we found a significant association of haplotype AT between CSCC and controls (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.31-3.97, P = 2.83 × 10-3) and the OR increased further in CSCC patients infected with HPV-16 (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.55-5.37, P = 4.54 × 10-4). The linkage disequilibrium analysis demonstrated that ITPR3 association with CSCC was independent of HLA-DRB1 alleles. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AT haplotype in the ITPR3 gene may serve as a potential marker for genetic susceptibility to CSCC.",

Various subject specific and exercise related parameters affect endurance of an individual. In this work, we propose a statistical technique to model endurance as a function of these factors incorporating the serial dependence of observations generated by individuals over time. The proposed model provides a device to predict future endurance of a test subject following particular exercise regime. This facilitates a test user with a fitness planner with the provision to fix exercise regimes to reach a set fitness goal.",

Case report of a patient diagnosed with chikungunya infection presenting with blurry vision and floaters. Exam revealed a unilateral intermediate uveitis, with an extensive work-up positive for chikungunya virus immunoglobulin M and G titers. The patient responded to oral corticosteroids with signs and symptoms resolving over the course of 3 months ' treatment. While anterior uveitis and retinitis are the most common ocular manifestations of chikungunya infection, we report here a case of chikungunya infection presenting as an intermediate uveitis, responding well to oral corticosteroids. This case demonstrates the varied presentation of chikungunya -related uveitis and highlights its consideration in the differential diagnoses of those who have had preceding systemic viral symptoms and uveitis.",
  "27704589": "Identifying research priorities with nurses at a tertiary children's hospital in the United Kingdom The objective of this study was to undertake a research priority setting exercise with the aim of maximizing efficiency and impact in research activity undertaken by nurses at one children's tertiary healthcare institution by ensuring the clinical staff directly shaped a coherent, transparent and consensus driven nurse-led research agenda. In Round 1, the research topics of 147 nurses were elicited using a modified nominal group technique as the consensus method. The number of participants in the 24 separate discussions ranged from 3 to 21, generating lists of between 6 and 23 topics. In Round 2, nurses from the clinical areas ranked topics of importance resulting in a set of four to five priorities. In Round 3, the divisional heads of nursing consulted with staff in all of their clinical areas to each finalize their five divisional priorities. The Nursing Research Working Group discussed and refined the divisions' priorities and voted on the final list to agree the top five research priorities for the organization. A total of 269 research topics were initially generated. Following three rounds of ranking and prioritizing, five priorities were agreed at Divisional level, and from these, the five top organizational priorities were selected. These were (i) understanding and improving all aspects of the patient journey through the hospital system; (ii) play; (iii) staff wellbeing, patient care and productivity; (iv) team work - linking to a more efficient service; and (v) supporting parents / parent pathway. Divisional priorities have been disseminated widely to clinical teams to inform a patient-specific nurse-led research agenda. Organizational priorities agreed upon have been disseminated through management structures and processes to ensure engagement at all levels. A subgroup of the Nursing Research Working Group has been delegated to take this work forward so that the agreed priorities continue to contribute towards shaping nurse-led research activity, thereby going some way to inform and embed an evidence-based culture of inquiry.",
  "28225881": "Zinc and metalloproteinases 2 and 9: What is their relation with breast cancer? Zinc is the catalytic component of proteins that regulate responses to DNA damage, intracellular signaling enzymes, and matrix metalloproteinases, which are important proteins in carcinogenesis. The objective of this review is to bring current information on the participation of zinc and matrix metalloproteinases types 2 and 9 in mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. We conducted a literature review, in consultation with the PubMed, Lilacs, and Scielo databases. The zinc and cysteine residues are structural elements shared by all members of the family of matrix metalloproteinases, and these proteins appear to be involved in the propagation of various types of neoplasms, including breast cancer. Moreover, transported zinc is likely to be used for the metalation of the catalytic domain of the newly synthesized metalloproteinases before the latter are secreted. Accordingly, increase in zinc concentrations in cellular compartments and the reduction of this trace element in the blood of patients with breast cancer appear to alter the activity of metalloproteinases 2 and 9, contributing to the occurrence of malignancy. Thus, it is necessary to carry out further studies with a view to clarify the role of zinc and metalloproteinases 2 and 9 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.",

We evaluated the efficacy of topical imiquimod (IQ) followed by carbon dioxide laser ablation of the lesion. From 2010 to 2015, 10 patients affected by CIS of the glans were treated by IQ, followed by carbon dioxide laser ablation. For every patient, we performed histologic examination before and after IQ. Local toxicity and adverse effects were recorded. After treatment, histologic examination showed no residual tumor in 6 patients (complete response [CR]), stable disease in 2 patients, and progressive disease in 2 patients. Those with a CR had human papillomavirus - related lesions, and they had no experienced relapses after a mean follow-up of 26 months. The 2 patients with progressive disease underwent total penectomy. All patients were alive at the last follow-up examination. All patients experienced a mild local toxicity (burning erythema) but no major adverse effects. Local treatment with IQ for glans CIS is effective mainly for human papillomavirus - related lesions. The present study is the first to record the histologic examination findings before and after IQ treatment. The small number of patients, owing to the rarity of this disease, was the main limitation of the present study. IQ must be used carefully, and a close follow-up protocol is mandatory because of the lack of long-term efficacy data.",
  "28273482": "Orai1 -Mediated Antimicrobial Secretion from Pancreatic Acini Shapes the Gut Microbiome and Regulates Gut Innate Immunity The gut microbiome participates in numerous physiologic functions and communicates intimately with the host immune system. Antimicrobial peptides are critica l components of intestinal innate immunity. We report a prominent role for antimicrobials secreted by pancreatic acini in shaping the gut microbiome that is essential for intestinal innate immunity, barrier function, and survival. Deletion of the Ca(2+) channel Orai1 in pancreatic acini of adult mice resulted in 60%-70% mortality within 3 weeks. Despite robust activation of the intestinal innate immune response, mice lacking acinar Orai1 exhibited intestinal bacterial outgrowth and dysbiosis, ultimately causing systemic translocation, inflammation, and death. While digestive enzyme supplementation was ineffective, treatments constraining bacterial outgrowth (purified liquid diet, broad-spectrum antibiotics) rescued survival, feeding, and weight gain. Pancreatic levels of cathelicidin -related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) were reduced, and supplement of synthetic CRAMP prevented intestinal disease. These findings reveal a critical role for antimicrobial pancreatic secretion in gut innate immunity.",
  "28443672": "Heightened HIV antibody responses in postpartum women as exemplified by recent infection assays: implications for incidence estimates Laboratory assays that identify recent HIV infections are important for assessing impacts of interventions aimed at reducing HIV incidence. Kinetics of HIV humoral responses can vary with inherent assay properties, and between HIV subtypes, populations and physiological states. They are important in determining mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) for antibody-based assays for detecting recent HIV infections. We determined MDRIs for BED-CEIA, LAg and BRAI assays for 101 seroconverting postpartum women, recruited in Harare in 1997- 2000 during the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies (ZVITAMBO) Trial, comparing them against published MDRIs estimated from seroconverting cases in the general population. We also compared MDRIs for women who seroconverted either during the first nine months, or at later stages, postpartum. At cut-offs (C) of 0.8 for BED, 1.5 for LAg and 40% for BRAI, estimated MDRIs for postpartum mothers, were 192, 104 and 144 days, 33%, 32-41% and 52% lower than published estimates of 287, 152-177 and 298 days, respectively, for clade C samples from general populations. Point estimates of MDRI values were 7 - 19% shorter for women who seroconverted in the first 9- months postpartum, compared with those seroconverting later. MDRI values for three HIV incidence biomarkers are longer in the general population than among postpartum women, particularly those who recently gave birth, consistent with heightened immunologic activation soon after birth. Our results provide a caution that MDRI may vary significantly between subjects in different physiological states.",

This cohort study assessed the effects of pregnancy on kidney disease progression and risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with IgAN. A cohort study. Women of child-bearing age with IgAN and minimum follow-up of 1 year after biopsy from December 2003 to September 2014. Pregnancy, treated as a time-dependent variable; baseline (at time of biopsy) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria, blood pressure, and kidney pathology (Oxford MEST classification). Kidney disease progression event, defined as 30% decline in eGFR or end-stage kidney disease; rate of eGFR decline; and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including severe preeclampsia and fetal loss. Of 413 patients enrolled, 266 (64.4%), 101 (24.5%), 40 (9.6%), and 6 (1.5%) had chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. During follow-up, 104 had 116 pregnancies, of which 110 continued beyond week 20; 309 patients did not become pregnant. After adjustment for age, eGFR, mean arterial pressure, proteinuria, and pathology class at the time of biopsy, subsequent pregnancy among patients with CKD stages 3 to 4, but not CKD stages 1 to 2, was associated with faster eGFR decline (-7.44 vs -3.90mL/min/1.73m(2) per year; P=0.007) and increased incidence of kidney progression events (HR, 5.14; 95% CI, 1.16-22.74) compared with patients who did not become pregnant. Relatively small sample size and single-center experience. Pregnancy accelerated kidney disease progression in women with IgAN and CKD stage 3, but not in those at stage 1 or 2.",
  "28509526": "Paraoxonases and psoriasis: negative imbalance of anti--oxidant endogenous mechanisms Numerous reports have shown that psoriasis patients are more exposed to lipoprotein peroxidation and to a decrease in the activity of paraoxonase (PON)1, an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory enzyme. Thus, it has been suggested that malfunction of the anti-oxidant system and an increased production of reactive oxygen species drive immune inflammatory events, that result in progressive skin cell damage in patients with psoriasis. The PON protein family, including PON1, PON2 and PON3, is one of the most important endogenous defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated PON gene expression in psoriasis and in cutaneous oxidative stress. The study population included 10 patients affected by moderate -to- severe plaque psoriasis and 15 healthy donors who have undergone to plastic surgery, were used as control. Skin punch biopsies of lesional and non lesional psoriatic skin were performed for analysis of PON2 and PON3 gene expression. In addition, oxidation assays in ex vivo full-thickness healthy skin organ cultures were performed. No significant differences were observed between PON2 and PON3 gene expression in psoriatic lesional and non lesional skin compared with healthy controls. H2O2 treatment induced a significant decrease of PON2 and PON3 expression in ex vivo full-thickness healthy skin organ cultures; conversely the pre-treatment of samples with the anti-oxidant reagent N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) induced a significant increase. Interestingly, no significant alterations were reported for PON2 and PON3 expression in ex vivo full-thickness healthy skin organ cultures stimulated with IL-17. Taken together our findings have revealed that a strong pro-oxidative activity is not effectively countered by anti-oxidant endogenous mechanisms both in psoriatic skin and in ex vivo experimental model.",
  "27820857": "Identification of In-Chain-Functionalized Compounds and Methyl-Branched Alkanes in Cuticular Waxes of Triticum aestivum cv. Bethlehem In this work, cuticular waxes from flag leaf blades and peduncles of Triticum aestivum cv. Bethlehem were investigated in search for novel wax compounds. Seven wax compound classes were detected that had previously not been reported, and their structures were elucidated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of various derivatives. Six of the classes were identified as series of homologs differing by two methylene units, while the seventh was a homologous series with homologs with single methylene unit differences. In the waxes of flag leaf blades, secondary alcohols (predominantly C27 and C33), primary / secondary diols (predominantly C28) and esters of primary / secondary diols (predominantly C50, combining C28 diol with C22 acid) were found, all sharing similar secondary hydroxyl group positions at and around C-12 or ω-12. 7- and 8-hydroxy-2-alkanol esters (predominantly C35), 7- and 8-oxo-2-alkanol esters (predominantly C35), and 4-alkylbutan-4-olides (predominantly C28) were found both in flag leaf and peduncle wax mixtures. Finally, a series of even - and odd-numbered alkane homologs was identified in both leaf and peduncle waxes, with an internal methyl branch preferentially on C-11 and C-13 of homologs with even total carbon number and on C-12 of odd-numbered homologs. Biosynthetic pathways are suggested for all compounds, based on common structural features and matching chain length profiles with other wheat wax compound classes.",

Through routine diagnostics, we identified 3 novel individuals with the seemingly uncommon combination of 22q11DS and JME. We subsequently screened the literature for reports focussing on the epilepsy phenotype in 22q11DS. We additionally screened a database of 173 22q11DS patients and identified a fourth individual with JME as well as 2 additional cases with GGE. We describe 6 novel and 22 published cases with co-occurrence of 22q11DS and GGE. In many patients, GGE was associated with myoclonic seizures allowing for a diagnosis of JME in at least 6 individuals. Seventeen of the 173 22q11DS cases (10%) had a diagnosis of either focal or generalized epilepsy. In these cases, focal epilepsy could often be attributed to syndrome-associated hypocalcaemia, cerebral bleeds, or structural brain anomalies. However, the cause of GGE remained unclear. In this study, we describe and review 28 individuals with 22q11DS and GGE (especially JME), showing that both disorders frequently co-occur. Compared to the reported prevalence of 15-21%, in our case series only 10% of 22q11DS individuals were found to have epilepsy, often GGE. Since 22q11.2 does not contain convincing GGE candidate genes, we discuss the possibility of an aetiological correlation through a possibly disturbed interaction with the GABAB receptor.",
  "28471941": "Basic science and pathogenesis of ageing with HIV: potential mechanisms and biomarkers : The increased prevalence of age -related comorbidities and mortality is worrisome in ageing HIV-infected patients. Here, we aim to analyse the different ageing mechanisms with regard to HIV infection. Ageing results from the time - dependent accumulation of random cellular damage. Epigenetic modifications and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups modulate ageing. In antiretroviral treatment -controlled patients, epigenetic clock appears to be advanced, and some haplogroups are associated with HIV infection severity. Telomere shortening is enhanced in HIV-infected patients because of HIV and some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Mitochondria -related oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA mutations are increased during ageing and also by some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Overall, increased inflammation or ' inflammageing ' is a major driver of ageing and could result from cell senescence with secreted proinflammatory mediators, altered gut microbiota, and coinfections. In HIV-infected patients, the level of inflammation and innate immunity activation is enhanced and related to most comorbidities and to mortality. This status could result, in addition to age, from the virus itself or viral protein released from reservoirs, from HIV -enhanced gut permeability and dysbiosis, from antiretroviral treatment, from frequent cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus coinfections, and also from personal and environmental factors, as central fat accumulation or smoking. Adaptive immune activation and immunosenescence are associated with comorbidities and mortality in the general population but are less predictive in HIV-infected patients. Biomarkers to evaluate ageing in HIV-infected patients are required. Numerous systemic or cellular inflammatory, immune activation, oxidative stress, or senescence markers can be tested in serum or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The novel European Study to Establish Biomarkers of Human Ageing MARK-AGE algorithm, evaluating the biological age, is currently assessed in HIV-infected patients and reveals an advanced biological age. Some enhanced inflammatory or innate immune activation markers are interesting but still not validated for the patient's follow-up. To be able to assess patients ' biological age is an important objective to improve their healthspan.",
  "27729641": "Intracellular localization of Saffold virus Leader (L) protein differs in Vero and HEp-2 cells The Saffold virus (SAFV) genome is translated as a single long polyprotein precursor and co-translationally cleaved to yield 12 separate viral proteins. Little is known about the activities of SAFV proteins although their homologs in other picornaviruses have already been described. To further support research on functions and activities of respective viral proteins, we investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of SAFV proteins in Vero and HEp-2 cells that had been either transfected with plasmids that express individual viral proteins or infected with live SAFV. Our results revealed that, with the exception of the Leader (L) protein, all viral proteins were localized in the cytoplasm at all the time points assayed. The L protein was found in the cytoplasm at an early time point but was subsequently translocated to the nucleus of HEp-2, but not Vero, cells. This was observed in both transfected and infected cells. Further mutational analysis of L protein revealed that Threonine 58 of the Ser / Thr -rich domain of L protein is crucial for protein trafficking between the cytoplasm and nucleus in HEp-2 cells. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding and stimulate investigation of the differetial cellular responses of HEp-2 cells in comparison to other mammalian cell lines during SAFV infection.",
  "28259683": "Inhibition of Sebum Production with the Acetyl Coenzyme A Carboxylase Inhibitor Olumacostat Glasaretil Olumacostat glasaretil (OG) is a small molecule inhibitor of acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that controls the first rate-limiting step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Inhibition of ACC activity in the sebaceous glands is designed to substantially affect sebum production, because over 80% of human sebum components contain fatty acids. OG inhibits de novo lipid synthesis in primary and transformed human sebocytes. TrueMass Sebum Panel analyses showed a reduction in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acyl chains across lipid species, including di- and triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, and wax esters in OG - treated sebocytes. There was no shift to shorter acyl chain lengths observed, suggesting that the fatty acid chain elongation process was not affected. OG is a pro-drug of the ACC inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid and was designed to enhance delivery in vivo. Topical application of OG but not 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid significantly reduced hamster ear sebaceous gland size, indicating that this pro-drug approach was critical to obtain the desired activity in vivo. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses of hamster ear extracts showed that OG treatment increased ACC levels and the ratio of acetyl-CoA to free CoA in these animals, indicating increased fatty acid oxidation. These changes are consistent with ACC inhibition. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging showed that OG applied onto Yorkshire pig ears accumulated in sebaceous glands relative to the surrounding dermis. Sebaceous gland ACC represents an attractive therapeutic target given its central role in formation of sebum, a key factor in acne pathogenesis.",
  "28254372": "Tumor accumulation of liposomal doxorubicin in three murine models: Optimizing delivery efficiency Systemic drug delivery to a solid tumor involves a sequence of steps that determine efficacy and survival. Extravasation from circulation at the tumor site is a critical step in this sequence since it regulates how much of the drug accumulates in the tumor. Despite its importance in determining outcomes, extravasation from circulation remains a \"black box.\" The objective of this study is to develop predictive tools for optimization of drug delivery systems. By comparing pharmacokinetics of liposomal doxorubicin in tumor -free and tumor bearing mice we quantitatively assess the rate constants for distribution, elimination, and tumor accumulation. We then relate these rate constants to the tumor -type and drug delivery system. We compare tumor accumulation in three tumor types and show a 10-fold difference between a colorectal adenocarcinoma and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Finally, we show how quantitative predictions of changes in tumor accumulation can be used to optimize drug delivery system s.",
  "27086366": "The Role of TRAF4 and B3GAT1 Gene Expression in the Food Hypersensitivity and Insect Venom Allergy in Mastocytosis Mastocytosis is an uncommon disease classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm, however, its symptoms are broad and place patients at crossroads between dermatology, hematology and allergology. Patients with mastocytosis often suffer from symptoms resulting from the activation and release of mediators from the mast cells, such as generalized itching, redness, headache, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bone pain or arthritis, hypotension and shock. The possible severe, fatal or near fatal reactions caused by food hypersensitivity are reasons for the research focused on marker identification. The aim of the study was to analyse the gene expression differences in mastocytosis patients with and without food and drug hypersensitivity and insect venom allergy (IVA). A total of 57 Caucasian patients with mastocytosis were studied [median age 41.8; range 18-77 years; 15 (26.3 %) males and 42 (73.7 %) females]. Quantitative RT-PCRs of 11 genes plus ribosomal 18S RNA were run. Symptoms of food hypersensitivity were found in 12 patients (21 %), including 3 patients (13 %) with cutaneous mastocytosis (CM), and 9 (28 %) with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM). IVA was confirmed in 13 patients (22.8 %) including 6 patients (10.5 %) with CM, and 7 patients (12.3 %) with ISM. Drug hypersensitivity was diagnosed in 10 patients (17.5 %). Significant differences in the gene expression were found for TRAF4 (p = 0.008) in the comparison of the mastocytosis patients with and without concomitant food hypersensitivity. Furthermore significant differences were found in gene expression for B3GAT1 (p = 0.003) in patients with IVA compared to patients without insect sting anaphylaxis in the medical history. The expression of studied genes did not differ according to the presence of drug hypersensitivity. The TRAF4 expression was higher in mastocytosis patients with food hypersensitivity in their medical history, the B3GAT1 expression was lower in mastocytosis patients with IVA in history.",
  "28446912": "Temporal and Spatial Variability of Fungal Structures and Host Responses in an Incompatible Rust-Wheat Interaction Information about temporal and spatial variability of fungal structures and host responses is scarce in comparison to the vast amount of genetic, biochemical, and physiological studies of host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we used avirulent wild type and virulent mutant isolates of Puccinia striiformis to characterize the interactions in wheat carrying yellow rust Yr2 resistance. Both conventional and advanced microscopic techniques were used for a detailed study of morphology and growth of fungal colonies and associated host cell responses. The growth of the wild type isolates was highly restricted due to hypersensitive response (HR, plant cell death) indicated by autofluorescence and change in the shape of the affected plant cells. The host response appeared post - haustorial, but large variation in the time and stage of arrest was observed for individual fungal colonies, probably due to a delay between detection and response. Some colonies were stopped right after the formation of the primary infection hyphae whereas others formed highly branched mycelia. HR was first observed in host cells in direct contact with fungal structures, after which the defense responses spread to adjacent host cells, and eventually led to encasement of the fungal colony. Several cells with HR contained haustoria, which were small and underdeveloped, but some cells contained normal sized haustoria without signs of hypersensitivity. The growth of the virulent mutants in the resistant plants was similar to the growth in plants without Yr2 resistance, which is a strong indication that the incompatible phenotype was associated with Yr2. The interaction between P. striiformis and wheat with Yr2 resistance was highly variable in time and space, which demonstrate that histological studies are important for a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions and plant defense mechanisms in general.",
  "28293289": "Novel Acinetobacter parvus HANDI 309 microbial biomass for the production of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) using swollen chitin substrate in submerged fermentation N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc)6 is extensively used as an important bio-agent and a functional food additive. The traditional chemical process for GlcNAc production has some problems such as high production cost, low yield, and acidic pollution .Therefore, to discover a novel chitinase that is suitable for bioconversion of chitin to GlcNAc would be of great value. Here, we describe the complete isolation and functional characterization of a novel exo-chitinase from Acinetobacter parvus HANDI 309 for the conversion of chitin. The identified exo-chitinase mainly produced N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, using chitin as a substrate by submerged fermentation. The A. parvus HANDI 309 biofuels producing exo-chitinase were characterized by TLC, and was further validated and quantified by HPLC. Furthermore, the optimal temperature and pH for the exo-chitinase activity was obtained in the culture conditions of 30 °C and 7.0, respectively. The maximum growth of the stationary phase was reached in 24 h after incubation. These results suggest that A. parvus HANDI 309 biofuels producing exo-chitinases may have great potential in chitin to N-acetyl-d-glucosamine conversion. The excellent thermostability and hydrolytic properties may give the exo-chitinase great potential in chitin to GlcNAc conversion in industry. This is the first report that A. parvus HANDI 309 is a novel bacterial strain that has the ability to produce an enormous amount of exo-chitinase - producing bio-agents in a short time on an industrial scale without any pretreatment, as well as being potentially valuable in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",

But little is known about gaze use when social interactions co-occur with other joint activities. We investigated the case of walking while talking. We assessed how gaze gets allocated among various targets in mobile conversations, whether allocation of gaze to other targets affects conversational coordination, and whether reduced availability of gaze for conversational coordination affects conversational performance and content. In an experimental study, pairs were videotaped in four conditions of mobility (standing still, talking while walking along a straight-line itinerary, talking while walking along a complex itinerary, or walking along a complex itinerary with no conversational task). Gaze to partners was substantially reduced in mobile conversations, but gaze was still used to coordinate conversation via displays of mutual orientation, and conversational performance and content was not different between stationary and mobile conditions. Results expand the phenomena of multitasking to joint activities.",

The WHOQOL-OLD questionnaire was answered by 105 older adults aged 60 to 90 years who were newly fitted hearing aids on the day of fitting and at 2 - 6 months afterward. The associations between the daily hours of hearing aid usage and social relations with changes in the WHOQOL-OLD total score after hearing aids fitting were estimated adjusting for possible confounders. Older persons with hearing loss experienced significant increases in WHOQOL-OLD total score after hearing aid fitting. Regular use of hearing aid was associated with a greater increase in the total score. The combined categorical variable of social relations and hearing aid usage revealed no separate effects of these two variables, but a combined effect; only those with frequent social interactions who used their hearing aid regularly had a significantly greater increase in WHOQOL-OLD total score. This study's findings indicate that hearing aid fitting may be associated with a subsequent improvement in older - person - specific QOL by improvements in hearing due to the hearing aid, and possibly enhanced communication opportunities.",

The aim of our research is to study the effect of multiple variables for potential risk of falls and construct an elderly fall risk assessment model based on demographics data and gait characteristics. A total of 101 subjects, whom belong to Malianwa Street, aged above 50 years old and participated in questionnaire survey. Participants were classified into three groups (high, medium and low risk group) according to the score of elderly fall risk assessment scale. In addition, the data of ground reaction force (GRF) and ground reaction moment (GRM) was record when they performed walking at comfortable state. The demographic variables, sample entropy of GRF and GRM, and impulse difference of bilateral foot were considered as potential explanatory variables of risk assessment model. Firstly, we investigated whether different groups could present difference in every variable. Statistical differences were found for the following variables: age (p=2.28e-05); impulse difference (p=0.02036); sample entropy of GRF in vertical direction (p=0.0144); sample entropy of GRM in anterior-posterior direction (p=0.0387). Finally, the multiple regression analysis results indicated that age, impulse difference and sample entropy of resultant GRM could identify individuals who had different levels of fall risk.

  "27667643": "' Yarn with me': applying clinical yarning to improve clinician - patient communication in Aboriginal health care Although successful communication is at the heart of the clinical consultation, communication between Aboriginal patients and practitioners such as doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, continues to be problematic and is arguably the biggest barrier to the delivery of successful health care to Aboriginal people. This paper presents an overarching framework for practitioners to help them reorientate their communication with Aboriginal patients using ' clinical yarning '. Clinical yarning is a patient -centred approach that marries Aboriginal cultural communication preferences with biomedical understandings of health and disease. Clinical yarning consists of three interrelated areas: the social yarn, in which the practitioner aims to find common ground and develop the interpersonal relationship; the diagnostic yarn, in which the practitioner facilitates the patient's health story while interpreting it through a biomedical or scientific lens; and the management yarn, that employs stories and metaphors as tools for patients to help them understand a health issue so a collaborative management approach can be adopted. There is cultural and research evidence that supports this approach. Clinical yarning has the potential to improve outcomes for patients and practitioners.",

Several factors may influence adherence behavior. This cross-sectional study aimed to highlight socioeconomic predictors of adherence behavior among a cohort of 242 adult Malaysian patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Hospital Sungai Buloh, Malaysia, where they were enrolled in a parent study (single-blinded randomized controlled trial) between January and December 2014. Statistical analysis of secondary data on adherence behavior and sociodemographic characteristics of the patients revealed mean age of 33.4 years and ranged from 18 to 64 years; 88.8% were males. A total of 224 (93%) patients who completed 6 months' adherence assessment were included in the model. Of these, 135 (60.3%) achieved optimal adherence. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis revealed that patient's income and ethnicity were significant predictors of adherence behavior. This may be valuable for targeted programmatic interventions to further enhance successful treatment outcomes among the target population.",

  "27271969": "Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Bark and Ambrosia Beetles in a Brazilian Tropical Dry Forest Bark and the ambrosia beetles dig into host plants and live most of their lives in concealed tunnels. We assessed beetle community dynamics in tropical dry forest sites in early, intermediate, and late successional stages, evaluating the influence of resource availability and seasonal variations in guild structure. We collected a total of 763 beetles from 23 species, including 14 bark beetle species, and 9 ambrosia beetle species. Local richness of bark and ambrosia beetles was estimated at 31 species. Bark and ambrosia composition was similar over the successional stages gradient, and beta diversity among sites was primarily determined by species turnover, mainly in the bark beetle community. Bark beetle richness and abundance were higher at intermediate stages; availability of wood was the main spatial mechanism. Climate factors were effectively non-seasonal. Ambrosia beetles were not influenced by successional stages, however the increase in wood resulted in increased abundance. We found higher richness at the end of the dry and wet seasons, and abundance increased with air moisture and decreased with higher temperatures and greater rainfall. In summary, bark beetle species accumulation was higher at sites with better wood production, while the needs of fungi (host and air moisture), resulted in a favorable conditions for species accumulation of ambrosia. The overall biological pattern among guilds differed from tropical rain forests, showing patterns similar to dry forest areas.",

The collected data were described and the sequenced glycoprotein (G) and nucleoprotein (N) genes were implemented to estimate the evolutionary rates and phylogeographic patterns using BEAST v.1.8.2. 269 rabies cases were reported and 70.26% of the cases were male and 61.71% were between the ages of 19 to 59. The majority of the cases were farmers (83.27%). The estimated evolutionary rate of the N genes was 2.4 × 10(-4) substitutions/site/year and the G genes was 3.4 × 10(-4). The time of the most recent common ancestor(TMRCA) was estimated around 1990. We detected viral migration paths from Sichuan, Guizhou and Hunan to Hanzhong prefecture of Shaanxi and then spreaded to Xi'an and other prefectures. The main population affected by rabies virus was male adult farmers. The evolution rate of rabies viruses in Shaanxi was similar with the prior results reported by others and the ancestor virus should be circulating in neighboring province Sichuan around 1990 and then transmitted to Shaanxi. Promptly standard wound treatment and timely post-exposure prophylaxis should be compulsory for the dog-bitten victims. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

It is considered the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, being many of them unknown. Therefore, there is a dire necessity for the identification of novel molecular players for the understanding of this disease. In this data article we determined the protein expression profiles of whole protein extracts from cortex regions of brains from patients with Alzheimer׳s disease in comparison to a normal brain. We identified 721 iTRAQ-labeled polypeptides with more than 95% in confidence. We analyzed all proteins that changed in their expression level and located them in the KEGG metabolic pathways, as well as in the mitochondrial complexes of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase. In addition, we analyzed the over- and sub-expressed polypeptides through IPA software, specifically Core I and Biomarkers I modules. Data in this article is related to the research article \"Identification of proteins that are differentially expressed in brains with Alzheimer's disease using iTRAQ labeling and tandem mass spectrometry \" (Minjarez et al., 2016) [1].",

Data on suicides and open verdicts in men aged 15-34 were obtained from coroner's records in Newcastle upon Tyne and analysed using SPSS software. Results An increase in suicide rates from the first to the second decade was followed by a fall in the third decade. This was associated with an increasing proportion of single men, those living alone, unemployment, consumption of alcohol, use of hanging, previous suicide attempt and history of treatment for mental illness. Clinical implications This study highlights the need for more interventions and focus to be given to young males in the suicide prevention area and is of high importance in the field of public health. Areas that could be tackled include reducing access to means of suicide, reducing alcohol use, support for relationship difficulties, engagement with mental health services and management of chronic illness.",
  "27998307": "Neuro-Behcet disease presenting as a solitary cerebellar hemorrhagic lesion: a case report and review of the literature Behcet's disease is a heterogeneous, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. The classic triad of oral and genital ulcerations in conjunction with uveitis was originally described by the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behcet in 1937, but associated symptoms of the cardiovascular, central nervous, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems were later identified. In fact, Behcet's disease with neurological involvement (neuro-Behcet's disease) is not uncommon. Patients with neuro-Behcet's disease typically exhibit a diverse array of symptoms, most commonly in the brainstem and diencephalic regions. Herein, we report an unusual case of neuro-Behcet's disease in a patient who presented with a solitary cerebellar hemorrhage. A 39-year-old Asian woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of a sudden speech difficulty that had manifested the same morning, and dizziness and mild vomiting experienced over the previous 3 days. Magnetic resonance images revealed target-like hemorrhagic lesions in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum. Risk factors that may result in cerebellar hemorrhage, such as high blood pressure or bleeding diathesis, were ruled out, and subsequent brain angiograms were normal. These findings suggest that the patient's cerebellar hemorrhage could have been due to intracranial vasculitis in a rare, if not unique, complication of neuro-Behcet's disease.",
  "27576608": "Ocular toxicity of AUY922 in pigmented and albino rats AUY922, a heat shock protein 90 inhibitor is associated with ocular adverse events (AEs). To provide a better understanding of ocular AEs in patients, 4 investigative studies were performed in a step-wise approach to assess retinal structure and function in pigmented (Brown Norway) and albino (Wistar) rats. In rats administered 30mg/kg of AUY922, the AUC 0-24 h and Cmax are comparable to that in patients at 70mg/m(2). AUY922 at ≥30mg/kg was poorly tolerated by rats with morbidity or mortality generally after the third weekly treatment. Electroretinography (ERG) changes were observed at doses ≥30mg/kg. The ERG changes were dose dependent, consistent with an effect on the photoreceptors, and fully reversible. The ERG effects could not be minimized by decreasing the Cmax while maintaining AUC. Histopathological changes were seen mainly when rats were administered AUY922 at 100mg/kg. The 2- hour infusion of AUY922 at 100mg/kg caused disorganization of the outer segment photoreceptor morphology in male Brown Norway rats; the severity of the disorganization increased with the number of administrations, but was reversible during a 4- week posttreatment period. There was no major difference in ocular response between Brown Norway and Wistar rats. No changes in serum iron levels, and no changes in rhodopsin, PDE6α, β-transducin concentrations, or retinal pigment epithelium-specific protein RPE65 expression were observed after single and multiple infusions of AUY922 at 100mg/kg compared to vehicle-treated controls. AUY922 retinal toxicity in rats recapitulates and further characterizes that reported in patients and is shown to be reversible, while a precise molecular mechanism for the effect was not determined.",

We studied the association between groups of body mass index and suicide methods. We identified all medicolegal autopsy cases with a cause of death due to external causes in Sweden during 1999-2013 (N = 39,368) and included 11,715 suicides and 13,316 accidents or homicides as controls. We applied multinomial regression models adjusted for age, sex, year and season of death. Obesity was associated with suicidal intoxication, OR 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02, 1.30] and negatively associated with all other suicide methods studied. Underweight showed a negative association with suicidal drowning and there was an indication towards a negative association with hanging in men OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.65, 1.01). We conclude that body mass index (BMI) is associated with the choice of suicide method. This may be of importance in a public health perspective, e.g. potential for prevention of intoxications. In the practice of forensic medicine, the physician's level of suspicion may rise if the apparent suicidal method is less common for the individual characteristics of the deceased, such as BMI.",
  "27500005": "Operative surgical nuances of modified extradural temporopolar approach with mini-peeling of dura propria based on cadaveric anatomical study of lateral cavernous structures Extradural temporopolar approach (ETA) has been modified as less invasive manner and named as trans-superior orbital fissure (SOF) approach with mini-peeling technique. The present study discusses the operative nuances of this modified technique on the basis of cadaveric study of lateral cavernous structures. In five consecutive cadaveric specimens, we performed an extradural anterior clinoidectomy with mini-peeling of the dura propria to expose the anterior clinoid process entirely. We also investigated the histological characteristics of the lateral cavernous sinus (CS) between the dura propria and periosteal dura at the SOF, foramen rotundum (FR), and foramen ovale (FO) levels, and of each trigeminal nerve division. Coronal histological examination of the lateral wall of the CS showed invagination of the dura propria and periosteal dura into the SOF. In contrast, no such invagination was observed at the levels of the FR and FO. This finding supports the technical rationale of the only skeletonization of the SOF for peeling of the dura propria but not FR. In addition, our modified ETA method needs only minimal dural incision between the SOF and FR where no cranial nerves are present. Our technical modification of ETA may be recommended for surgical treatment of paraclinoid lesions to reduce the risk of intraoperative neurovascular injury.",
  "27273307": "Pathophysiology, treatment and prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic condition that affects 1% of women that undergo treatment with assisted reproductive technology. The review aims to summarize recent evidence on pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of OHSS. The pathophysiology is still not completely understood; however, vascular endothelial growth factor is likely to be an important mediator. Human chorionic gonadotropin was previously thought to be necessary for OHSS to occur; however, recent case reports have proven otherwise. The contribution of an attenuated anti-Mullerian hormone signalling pathway and CD11c + HLA-DR + dendritic cells and associated interleukins has been explored recently as contributors to pathogenesis. Treatment is largely supportive and is based mainly on consensus statements rather than evidence. Therefore, it is important to prevent this condition by identifying women at risk, allowing the clinician to implement preventive strategies, including the use of GnRH antagonist cycles with agonist triggers. More research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology behind the condition. Clinicians should employ strategies to prevent OHSS.",

Using a cross-sectional cohort design, we recruited 140 experienced male weightlifters 34 to 54 years of age, comprising 86 men reporting ≥2 years of cumulative lifetime AAS use and 54 nonusing men. Using transthoracic echocardiography and coronary computed tomography angiography, we assessed 3 primary outcome measures: left ventricular (LV) systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction), LV diastolic function (early relaxation velocity), and coronary atherosclerosis (coronary artery plaque volume). Compared with nonusers, AAS users demonstrated relatively reduced LV systolic function (mean ± SD left ventricular ejection fraction = 52±11% versus 63±8%; P<0.001) and diastolic function (early relaxation velocity = 9.3±2.4 cm/second versus 11.1±2.0 cm/second; P<0.001). Users currently taking AAS at the time of evaluation (N=58) showed significantly reduced LV systolic (left ventricular ejection fraction = 49±10% versus 58±10%; P<0.001) and diastolic function (early relaxation velocity = 8.9±2.4 cm/second versus 10.1±2.4 cm/second; P=0.035) compared with users currently off - drug (N=28). In addition, AAS users demonstrated higher coronary artery plaque volume than nonusers (median [interquartile range] 3 [0, 174] mL(3) versus 0 [0, 69] mL(3); P=0.012). Lifetime AAS dose was strongly associated with coronary atherosclerotic burden (increase [95% confidence interval] in rank of plaque volume for each 10- year increase in cumulative duration of AAS use: 0.60 SD units [0.16-1.03 SD units]; P=0.008). Long-term AAS use appears to be associated with myocardial dysfunction and accelerated coronary atherosclerosis.

This study developed a mathematical model for testing the indentation induced by a fluid jet and determined a semianalytical solution. The soft tissue was modeled as an elastic layer bonded to a rigid base. The pressure of the fluid jet impinging on the soft tissue was assumed to have a power-form function. The semianalytical solution was verified in detail using finite-element modeling, with excellent agreement being achieved. The effects of several parameters on the solution behaviors are reported, and a method for applying the solution to determine the mechanical properties of soft tissues is suggested.",
  "27875815": "Wang's Forceps -Assisted Catheter Reposition and Fixation: An Easy and Reliable Rescue Method Catheter migration and omental wrap are the most common causes of catheter malfunction, which usually result in catheter removal or replacement. The conventional open surgery for catheter reposition has many disadvantages. A new tunnel is needed throughout the procedure of catheter replacement causing more pain and frustration to the patients. Another drawback is that the incidence of catheter migration after conventional catheter reposition surgery is still as high as it was before the procedure. Wang's forceps, an instrument commonly used in our peritoneal dialysis center, is easy and effective in catheter insertion and fixation. Recently, we have successfully used the Wang's forceps to resolve the catheter displacement for 10 patients, including 1 patient who suffered from catheter tip migration 3 times and had undergone conventional catheter rescue by both open surgery and laparoscopy. This new technique was easy and reliable, and the original tunnel was maintained, which reduced pain and risk of infection in the patients. These advantages may grant the Wang's forceps technique favorable over the conventional surgical approach.",
  "28183596": "A numerical study on the application of the functionally graded materials in the stent design Undesirable deformation of the stent can induce a significant amount of injure not only to the blood vessel but also to the plaque. The objective of this study was to reduce/minimize these undesirable deformations by the application of Functionally Graded Materials (FGM). To do this, Finite Element (FE) method was employed to simulate the expansion of a stent and the corresponding displacement of the stenosis plaque. Three hyperelastic plaque types as well as five elastoplastic stents were simulated. Dogboning, foreshortening, maximum stress in the plaque, and the pressure which is needed to fully expand the stent for different stent materials, were acquired. While all FGMs had lower dogboning in comparison to the stents made of the uniform materials, the stent with the lowest heterogeneous index displayed the lowest amount of dogboning. Steel stent showed the lowest foreshortening and fully expansion pressure but the difference was much lower than that the one for dogboning. Therefore, the FGM with the heterogeneous index of 0.5 is expected to exhibit the most suitable results. In addition, the results revealed that the material parameters has crucial effects on the deformation of the stent and, as a result, as a design point of view the FGM parameters can be tailored to achieve the goal of the biomechanical optimization.",

Radiation risk model, patient dose data and data from national screening statistics were used to estimate the number of deaths due to radiation-induced breast cancers in the NHSBSP in England. Dose and dose effectiveness factors (DDREFs) equal to one and two were assumed. The breast cancer mortality reduction in the invited population due to screening and the percentage of females diagnosed with symptomatic breast cancer, who die from breast cancer, were collated from the literature. The number of lives saved owing to screening was calculated. Assuming, a total of 1,770,436 females between the ages of 50-70 years were screened each year, and a breast cancer mortality reduction of 20% due to screening in the invited population, the number of screen-detected cancers were 14,872 annually, resulting in 1071 lives saved. Conversely, for the same mortality reduction, the number of radiation-induced cancer s was 36 and 18 for DDREFs of 1 and 2, respectively. This resulted in seven and three deaths due to radiation-induced cancers annually for DDREFs of 1 and 2, respectively. The ratios of lives saved owing to screening to radiation-induced cancers were 30: 1 and 60: 1 for DDREFs of 1 and 2. The ratios of lives saved owing to screening to deaths due to radiation-induced cancer s were 156: 1 and 312: 1 for DDREFs of 1 and 2. For the 1.8% of the screening population with very thick breasts, the latter ratios decrease to 94: 1 and 187: 1 for DDREFs of 1 and 2. The breast cancer mortality reduction due to screening greatly outweighs the risk of death due to radiation-induced cancer s.

  "27827387": "DNA sequence diversity and the efficiency of natural selection in animal mitochondrial DNA Selection is expected to be more efficient in species that are more diverse because both the efficiency of natural selection and DNA sequence diversity are expected to depend upon the effective population size. We explore this relationship across a data set of 751 mammal species for which we have mitochondrial polymorphism data. We introduce a method by which we can examine the relationship between our measure of the efficiency of natural selection, the nonsynonymous relative to the synonymous nucleotide site diversity (πN / πS), and synonymous nucleotide diversity (πS), avoiding the statistical non-independence between the two quantities. We show that these two variables are strongly negatively and linearly correlated on a log scale. The slope is such that as πS doubles, πN / πS is reduced by 34%. We show that the slope of this relationship differs between the two phylogenetic groups for which we have the most data, rodents and bats, and that it also differs between species with high and low body mass, and between those with high and low mass -specific metabolic rate.",

How experience and internal state influence the duration of memory at the molecular level remains unknown. A self-assembled aggregated state of Drosophila Orb2A protein is required specifically for long-lasting memory. We report that in the adult fly brain the mRNA encoding Orb2A protein exists in an unspliced non-protein-coding form. The convergence of experience and internal drive transiently increases the spliced protein-coding Orb2A mRNA. A screen identified pasilla, the fly ortholog of mammalian Nova-1 / 2, as a mediator of Orb2A mRNA processing. A single-nucleotide substitution in the intronic region that reduces Pasilla binding and intron removal selectively impairs long-term memory. We posit that pasilla -mediated processing of unspliced Orb2A mRNA integrates experience and internal state to control Orb2A protein abundance and long-term memory formation.",
  "27430240": "Adenosine and the adenosine A2A receptor agonist, CGS21680, upregulate CD39 and CD73 expression through E2F-1 and CREB in regulatory T cells isolated from septic mice The number of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and the expression of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1; also known as CD39) and 5'-ectonucleotidase (NT5E; also known as CD73) on the Treg cell surface are increased during sepsis. In this study, to determine the factors leading to the high expression of CD39 and CD73, and the regulation of the CD39 / CD73 / adenosine pathway in Treg cells under septic conditions, we constructed a mouse model of sepsis and separated the Treg cells using a flow cytometer. The Treg cells isolated from the peritoneal lavage and splenocytes of the mice were treated with adenosine or the specific adenosine A2A receptor agonist, CGS21680, and were transfected with specific siRNA targeting E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F-1) or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), which are predicted transcription regulatory factors of CD39 or CD73. The regulatory relationships among these factors were then determined by western blot analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay. In addition, changes in adenosine metabolism were measured in the treated cells. The results revealed that adenosine and CGS21680 significantly upregulated CD39 and CD73 expression (P<0.01). E2F-1 and CREB induced CD39 and CD73 expression, and were upregulated by adenosine and CGS21680. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and adenosine generation were inhibited by the knockdown of E2F-1 or CREB, and were accelerated in the presence of CGS21680. Based on these results, it can be inferred that adenosine, the adenosine A2A receptor agonist, E2F-1 and CREB are the possible factors contributing to the high expression of CD39 and CD73 on the Treg cell surface during sepsis. Adenosine and its A2A receptor agonist served as the signal transducer factors of the CD39 / CD73 / adenosine pathway, accelerating adenosine generation. Our study may benefit further research on adenosine metabolism for the treatment of sepsis.",
  "28387851": "Does Intrawound Vancomycin Application During Spine Surgery Create Vancomycin-Resistant Organism? Surgical site infection (SSI) following spine surgery is a morbid and expensive complication. The use of intrawound vancomycin is emerging as a solution to reduce SSI. The development of vancomycin-resistant pathogens is an understandable concern. To determine the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant SSI in patients with and without use of intrawound vancomycin. Patients undergoing elective spine surgery were dichotomized based on whether intrawound vancomycin was applied. Outcome was occurrence of SSI requiring return to the operating room within postoperative 90 days. The intrawound culture and vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were reviewed. Analyses were conducted to compare the pathogen profile and MIC for vancomycin in patients who received vancomycin and those who did not. Of the total 2802 patients, 43% (n = 1215) had intrawound vancomycin application during the index surgery. The use of vancomycin was associated with significantly lower deep SSI rates (1.6% [n = 20] vs 2.5% [n = 40], P = .02). The occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus SSI was significantly lower in the patients who had application of intrawound vancomycin (32% vs 65%, P = .003). None of the patients who had application of intrawound vancomycin powder, and subsequently developed an S aureus SSI, demonstrated pathogens with resistance to vancomycin. All patients had MIC < 2 μg/mL, the vancomycin susceptibility threshold. The occurrence of gram-negative SSI (28% vs 7%) and culture negative fluid collection (16% vs 5%) was higher in the vancomycin cohort. The use of intrawound vancomycin during the index spine surgery was protective against SSI following spine surgery. The application of intrawound vancomycin during index surgery does not appear to create vancomycin-resistant organisms in the event of an SSI.",
  "28034357": "Psychological Stress in Pathogenesis of Essential Hypertension The article represents literature review and provides evidence for psychological stress to play essential role in the development of arterial hypertension. The pathogenesis of hypertension is complex with a significant diversity and variability of the mechanisms involved in individual patient. In this regard, the determination of specific pathogenic pathways underlying sustained blood pressure elevation in each patient would substantially individualize therapeutic approaches, and hence increase the effectiveness of treatment. Psychological stress is proposed as a significant factor contributing to the development of hypertension. Global urbanization, sedentary lifestyle, daily stress at workplace, lack of physical activity and social support lead to increased anxiety, uncertainty, and finally to chronic mental and emotional stress. This review provides information about alterations in neuroendocrine and immune systems as the main pathogenic pathways linking psychological stress and hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction is considered not only as a consequence but also a primary factor causing prohypertensive state. Moreover, physical inactivity is discussed as one of the plausible mechanisms playing a key role in the development of hypertension in modern lifestyle conditions. Particularly the loss of connection between psychosocial strain and physical activity may underlie the deleterious effect of stress on cardiovascular and metabolic health.",

In the active state, the catalytic core oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations. Currently, the intramolecular interactions that regulate the active state mechanics are not well understood. Here, using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a representative model coupled with biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques, we define a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions working harmoniously to regulate these mechanics. These include the previously identified salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix as well as an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and αC-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. Moreover, for over three decades it was thought that the highly conserved β3 -lysine was essential for phosphoryl transfer, but our findings show that the β3 -lysine is not required for phosphoryl transfer but is essential for the active state mechanics.",

As far as we know, toxic or anti-proliferative effects of MPH against cartilage tissue were not studied in the literature. The present study was carried out to investigate the possible effects of MPH on the proliferation, viability and differentiation of primary human chondrocytes, in vitro. Monolayer primary chondrocyte cultures were prepared using osteochondral tissue obtained from patients who underwent a total knee prosthesis operation. Stock solution of MPH was prepared and aliquots having 1-1000 µM concentrations of the drug was composed. These solutions were applied to the wells containing cultured chondrocyte samples within the well plates. Control groups were composed of pure chondrocyte culture and no solution was added into them. All groups were evaluated at 24, 48 and 72 h in order to determine the possible negative effects of the drug on the chondrocytes. The data were evaluated by Tukey's honestly significantly different test following analysis of variance. In the group where MPH was applied, it was found that viability, proliferation and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 protein expression were decreased in comparison to the control group. It was emphasized that clinicians should not disregard the fact that this drug might suppress chondrocyte cell proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation.",
  "27259677": "The \"tight orbit\": Incidence and management of the orbital compartment syndrome The orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) constitutes a severe emergency, requiring immediate clinical diagnosis and surgical decompression. The key symptom is progressive visual impairment caused by an increase in intraorbital pressure, impairing the perfusion of relevant neurovascular and neurosensory structures. Intraorbital bleeding due to trauma and surgical intervention is known to be the main etiological factor. A retrospective analysis of all patients affected by an OCS between January 1, 2012, and May 31, 2015, was performed. Patients' records were reviewed with regard to etiology, initial ophthalmologic status, fracture pattern, concomitant medication, surgical management, and postoperative outcome. The incidence of OCS was calculated based on the total number of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) emergencies. Within 3.5 years, a total of 18,093 CMF emergencies were registered. In 16 patients, an OCS was documented, corresponding to an incidence of 0.088%. The mean patient age was 67.31 ± 23.86 years, ranging from 22 to 102 years. The etiology varied, but trauma with subsequent intraorbital bleeding was the main cause. The use of anticoagulative medication was documented in 50% of the cases. In 14 patients, immediate surgical orbital decompression was performed: in 10 patients, vision could be preserved; in three patients, blindness resulted; and one patient was lost to follow-up. Two patients were managed without surgery. With regard to the total number of CMF emergencies, OCS is a rare condition. Early clinical diagnosis and surgical decompression are required to prevent permanent vision impairment. Anticoagulative medication must be considered as a predisposing factor for an orbital compartment syndrome in patients affected by periorbital trauma.",

Application of a 10% FDR revealed an additional 57 metabolites that were differentially abundant between groups. Pathway analysis suggests that the intervention results in changes in metabolites across many pathways such as phospholipid biosynthesis, choline metabolism, and lipoprotein metabolism. The observed plasma metabolomic alterations may reflect a Panchakarma - induced modulation of metabotypes. Panchakarma promoted statistically significant changes in plasma levels of phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and others in just 6 days. Forthcoming studies that integrate metabolomics with genomic, microbiome and physiological parameters may facilitate a broader systems - level understanding and mechanistic insights into these integrative practices that are employed to promote health and well-being.",
  "28394935": "eNOS S-nitrosylates β-actin on Cys374 and regulates PKC-θ at the immune synapse by impairing actin binding to profilin-1 The actin cytoskeleton coordinates the organization of signaling microclusters at the immune synapse (IS); however, the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We show here that nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) controls the coalescence of protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) at the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) of the IS. eNOS translocated with the Golgi to the IS and partially colocalized with F-actin around the c-SMAC. This resulted in reduced actin polymerization and centripetal retrograde flow of β-actin and PKC-θ from the lamellipodium-like distal (d)-SMAC, promoting PKC-θ activation. Furthermore, eNOS -derived NO S-nitrosylated β-actin on Cys374 and impaired actin binding to profilin-1 (PFN1), as confirmed with the transnitrosylating agent S-nitroso-L-cysteine (Cys-NO). The importance of NO and the formation of PFN1-actin complexes on the regulation of PKC-θ was corroborated by overexpression of PFN1 - and actin-binding defective mutants of β-actin (C374S) and PFN1 (H119E), respectively, which reduced the coalescence of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC. These findings unveil a novel NO -dependent mechanism by which the actin cytoskeleton controls the organization and activation of signaling microclusters at the IS.",
  "28135040": "Lipid levels and risk of recurrent venous thrombosis: results from the MEGA follow-up study Essentials The role of lipid levels in the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis is unclear. Lipids were assessed in patients with a first venous thrombosis (n = 2106) followed for 6.9 years. Lipids were not associated with recurrence, overall or in patients with unprovoked first events. Testing lipid levels is not useful to identify patients at an increased risk of recurrence. Background Knowledge of risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis may guide decisions on duration of anticoagulation. The association between lipid levels and first venous thrombosis has been studied extensively. However, data on the role of lipids in the risk of recurrence are scarce. Objective To assess the association between lipid levels and recurrent venous thrombosis. Patients /Methods Patients with a first venous thrombosis from the MEGA study were included. Follow-up started at the date of end of anticoagulant treatment. Percentile categories of total / low-density lipoprotein / high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoproteins B and A1 were established (< 10th, 10th-25th, 25th-75th [reference], 75th-90th, > 90th percentile). Lipids were measured at least 3 months after discontinuing anticoagulation. Results Of 2106 patients followed for a median of 6.9 years, 326 developed recurrence (incidence rate, 2.7/100 patient - years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-3.1). With hazard ratios ranging from 0.88 (95% CI, 0.55-1.42) to 1.33 (95% CI, 0.86-2.04) in the highest percentile category vs. the reference, we found no association across percentile categories between recurrence and lipid levels in age- and sex -adjusted models, nor after further adjustments for body mass index, diabetes, estrogen and statin use, and duration of anticoagulation. Subgroup analyses stratified by unprovoked or provoked first events, location (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) and sex also did not reveal an association with any of the lipid levels studied. Conclusions Testing lipid levels did not identify patients at an increased risk of recurrent venous thrombosis in this study, including those with unprovoked first events, and these should not influence decisions on duration of anticoagulation.",
  "27644674": "Breast Cancer Detection Rate, Incidence, Prevalence and Interval Cancer -related Mammography Screening Times among Thai Women A recent guideline by the American Cancer Society recommended that mammography (MMG) should be done for women starting in their mid-40s. In Thailand, information on opportunistic mammography screening is limited and data on the total incidence of breast cancer are also lacking. The purpose of this study was to estimate the breast cancer detection, incident and prevalence rates among Thai women. We retrospectively reviewed the opportunistic mammography screening of normal women between 30 and 80 years who underwent the procedure between 2001 and 2010. All cases were followed until 2012. The detection rate was calculated for the whole period of observation using ' number of women with positive findings ' divided by ' total number of women screened '. The incidence rate was calculated only at the first MMG while the subsequence rate was calculated based on all new cases detected at each subsequent MMG. Among the 47,430 women, there were 152,091 MMGs or approximately 3.2 occasions per person (range, 1-10). The average duration of the interval between each subsequence visit was 1.8 years. Overall, breast cancer was detected in 543 women, with a detection rate of 10.3 per 1,000 persons. The prevalence rate of breast cancer at the first visit was 5.78 per 1,000 person s. The incidence or new cases detected at any follow-up visit was 10.4 per 1,000 person s. The overall interval cancer was 0.91 per 1,000 women, mainly detected before their second and third MMG, with a rate of 0.0.47 and 0.76 per 1,000 women. Opportunistic mammography screening in Thailand detected 10 cases of breast cancer from each 1,000 women. This paper indicated a high rate of cancer detection during a two year interval, hence, a screening mammogram should be performed more often.",

In the optic of circular economy, silver chloride derived from the acid pre-treatment of electronic scraps was used as raw material and successively silver powders were synthesized from silver chloride solution using glucose syrup as reducing agent. The coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), potentiodynamic polarization test and antimicrobial tests. The results evidenced that the obtained coatings were homogenous and give to the samples higher corrosion resistance than untreated alloy. The silver particles, found both inside and outside of the pores that characterize the PEO layer, produced an efficacious antimicrobial effect both against E. coli and S. aureus.",

We recruited 42 patients with AD, 26 with MCI, and 66 normal elderly controls. The thicknesses of the RNFL and GCIPL were measured via spectral-domain optic coherent tomography in all participants at baseline. The patients with MCI or AD underwent clinical and neuropsychological tests at baseline and once every year thereafter for 2 years. The Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score exhibited significant negative relationships with the average GCIPL thickness (β = -0.15, p < 0.05) and the GCIPL thickness in the superotemporal, superonasal, and inferonasal sectors. The composite memory score exhibited significant positive associations with the average GCIPL thickness and the GCIPL thickness in the superotemporal, inferonasal, and inferotemporal sectors. The temporal RNFL thickness, the average and minimum GCIPL thicknesses, and the GCIPL thickness in the inferonasal, inferior, and inferotemporal sectors at baseline were significantly reduced in MCI patients who were converted to AD compared to stable MCI patients. The change of CDR-SB from baseline to 2 years exhibited significant negative associations with the average (β = -0.150, p = 0.006) and minimum GCIPL thicknesses as well as GCIPL thickness in the superotemporal, superior, superonasal, and inferonasal sectors at baseline. Our data suggest that macular GCIPL thickness represents a promising biomarker for monitoring the progression of MCI and AD.",
  "27282214": "Individual differences in behavioral activation and cardiac vagal control influence affective startle modification The startle response (SR) has a close relationship with stress responses. Startle modification (SRM) has been widely used to study stress disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder). The framework of the behavioral inhibition and activation systems (BIS / BAS) has been thought to correspond with withdrawal and approach motivational processes underlying affective SRM and can influence stress reactivity. Vagally-mediated cardiac activity as indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) has been associated with SRM and regulatory processes during stress. In the present study, the influence of individual differences in the BIS / BAS and resting HRV on affective SRM were examined. Eighty-six subjects viewed affective pictures while acoustic SR stimuli were delivered. Individual differences in motivation were measured by the BIS/BAS scales. The magnitude of SR was assessed as electromyographic activity of the SR eyeblink during pictures of different valences. Resting HRV was derived from electrocardiography. In contrast to previous studies, the present results showed that startle inhibition and potentiation were related to BAS and HRV, but not to BIS. There was also an interaction of BAS and HRV, indicating that the relationship between HRV and SRM strengthened as BAS scores decreased. The present findings suggest that BAS may relate to both withdrawal and approach, and trait stress reactivity is influence d by BAS and cardiac vagal activity. In addition, BAS moderates the relationship between cardiac vagal activity and SRM. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications for the study of SRM, stress disorders, and health.",

A random sample of 1000 infants and toddlers was recruited from 2 cities (Al Ain and Dubai) from March 2011 to February 2012 and their usual nutrient intake was determined using 24-hour recall. In all, 54.2% of infants and 25.2% of toddlers were breastfeeding. Mean energy intake of infant girls in Al Ain and Dubai was 747 (SD 189) kcal and 773 (SD 215) kcal respectively and 810.5 (SD 232.2) kcal and 821.9 (SD 262) kcal for boys.

  "28042952": "Uncoupling protein 2 downregulation by hypoxia through repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ promotes chemoresistance of non-small cell lung cancer Hypoxic microenvironment is critically involved in the response of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to chemotherapy, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Here, we found that NSCLC patients exhibited increased chemotherapeutic resistance when complicated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a critical cause of chronic hypoxemia. The downregulation of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), which is attributed to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-mediated suppression of the transcriptional factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), was involved in NSCLC chemoresistance, and predicted a poor survival rate of patients receiving routine chemotherapy. UCP2 suppression induced reactive oxygen species production and upregulation of the ABC transporter protein ABCG2, which leads to chemoresistance by promoting drug efflux. UCP2 downregulation also altered metabolic rates as shown by elevated glucose uptake and reduced oxygen consumption. These data suggest that UCP2 is a key mediator of hypoxia -triggered chemoresistance of NSCLCs, which can be potentially targeted in clinical treatment of chemo-refractory NSCLCs.",

This property is clinically relevant for the improvement of T cell -based antitumor therapies. Diacylglycerol kinase α and ζ (DGKα / ζ) metabolize the diacylglycerol generated following antigen recognition by T lymphocytes. Enhanced expression of these two lipid kinases in tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells promotes a hyporesponsive state that contributes to tumor immune escape. Inhibition of these two enzymes might thus be of interest for potentiating conventional antigen -directed tumor elimination. In this study, we sought to characterize the contribution of DGKα and ζ to antigen -independent cytotoxic functions of CD8(+) T cells. Analysis of DGKζ - deficient mice showed an increase in bystander memory -like CD8(+) T cell populations not observed in DGKα - deficient mice. We demonstrate that DGKζ limits cytokine responses in an antigen -independent manner. Cytokine -specific expansion of DGKζ - deficient CD8(+) T cells promoted enhanced differentiation of innate-like cytotoxic cells in vitro, and correlated with the more potent in vivo anti-tumor responses of DGKζ - deficient mice engrafted with the murine A20 lymphoma. Our studies reveal a isoform - specific function for DGKζ downstream of IL-2 / IL-15 -mediated expansion of innate-like cytotoxic T cells, Pharmacological manipulation of DGKζ activity is of therapeutic interest for cytokine -directed anti-tumor treatments.",
  "27976741": "Weighing Scale -Based Pulse Transit Time is a Superior Marker of Blood Pressure than Conventional Pulse Arrival Time Pulse transit time (PTT) is being widely pursued for cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Most efforts have employed the time delay between ECG and finger photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms as a convenient surrogate of PTT. However, these conventional pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements include the pre-ejection period (PEP) and the time delay through small, muscular arteries and may thus be an unreliable marker of BP. We assessed a bathroom weighing scale-like system for convenient measurement of ballistocardiography and foot PPG waveforms - and thus PTT through larger, more elastic arteries - in terms of its ability to improve tracking of BP in individual subjects. We measured \" scale PTT \", conventional PAT, and cuff BP in humans during interventions that increased BP but changed PEP and smooth muscle contraction differently. Scale PTT tracked the diastolic BP changes well, with correlation coefficient of -0.80 ± 0.02 (mean ± SE) and root-mean-squared-error of 7.6 ± 0.5 mmHg after a best-case calibration. Conventional PAT was significantly inferior in tracking these changes, with correlation coefficien t of -0.60 ± 0.04 and root-mean-squared-error of 14.6 ± 1.5 mmHg (p < 0.05). Scale PTT also tracked the systolic BP changes better than conventional PAT but not to an acceptable level. With further development, scale PTT may permit reliable, convenient measurement of BP.",
  "28491259": "The Antibacterial Effect of Additional Photodynamic Therapy in Failed Endodontically Treated Teeth: A Pilot Study Introduction: Root canal therapy as a routine dental procedure has resulted in retention of millions of teeth that would otherwise be lost. Unfortunately, successful outcomes are not always achievable within initial endodontic treatments, and that necessitates further treatment. Nonsurgical retreatment is the first choice in most clinical situations. The aim of this clinical pilot study was to assess the effect of additional photodynamic therapy (PDT) on intraradicular bacterial load following retreatment of failed previously root treated teeth. Methods: Thirty single-rooted / canalled endodontically treated matured teeth (in 27 healthy patients) accompanied by apical periodontitis (AP) were selected for this study. Standard protocol was followed for nonsurgical retreatment of each tooth. Microbiological samples were taken after establishment of apical patency, finished cleaning/shaping procedure, and PDT (665 nm, 1 W, 240 seconds). All samples were cultured for 72 hours and colony-forming unit (CFU) was counted. McNemar test was used for statistical analysis of the data. The level of significance was set at 0.001. Results: Routine cleaning and shaping resulted in twenty four negative (80%) out of 30 cultures. Four additional negative results were obtained after additional PDT (93.3%). The addition of PDT to routine procedures significantly enhanced the number of bacteria -free samples (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Regarding elimination of intraradicular microbiota, additional PDT may increase the effectiveness of conventional chemomechanical preparation in previously root filled teeth accompanied by AP. Well controlled randomized clinical trials should be planned for future.",

Although NOACs are more convenient than warfarin, their lack of monitoring may predispose patients to non-persistence. Limited information is available on NOAC non-persistence rates and related clinical outcomes in clinical practice. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data from Ontario, Canada, from January 1998 to March 2014 of patients with AF who were dispensed dabigatran or rivaroxaban. Non-persistence was defined as a gap in dabigatran or rivaroxaban prescriptions ≥14 days. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the primary composite outcome of stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and mortality associated with non-persistence. The cohort consisted of 15 857 dabigatran (age 80.7±6.7 year) and 10 119 rivaroxaban users (age 77.0±7.1 year) with women comprising 52% of each medication group. At 6 months, 36.4% of patients were non-persistent to dabigatran, while 31.9% of patients were non-persistent to rivaroxaban. Stroke / TIA / death was significantly higher for those non-persistent to dabigatran (HR 1.76 (95% CI 1.60 to 1.94); p<0.0001) or rivaroxaban (HR 1.89 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.19); p<0.0001) compared with those who were persistent. Risk of stroke / TIA was markedly higher in non-persistent patients to dabigatran (HR 3.75 (95% CI 2.59 to 5.43); p<0.0001) and rivaroxaban (HR 6.25 (95% CI 3.37 to 11.58); p<0.0001) than those persistent. NOAC non-persistence rates are high in clinical practice, with approximately one in three patients becoming non-persistent to dabigatran or rivaroxaban within 6 months after drug initiation. Non-persistence with either dabigatran or rivaroxaban is significantly associated with worse clinical outcomes of stroke / TIA / death.",
  "27271775": "Effect of target animacy on hand preference in Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) Twenty-eight captive Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) were involved in the current study. Many individuals showed handedness, with a modest tendency toward left-hand use especially for animate targets, although no group-level handedness was found. There was no significant gender difference in the direction and strength of hand preference for both targets. Females showed a significantly higher overall rate of actions toward animate targets than inanimate targets for both hands, whereas males displayed almost the reversed pattern. There were no significant interactions between lateral hand use and target animacy for either males or females. Most individuals showed rightward or leftward laterality shift trends between inanimate and animate targets. These findings to some extent support the existence of a potential trend concerning a categorical neural distinction between targets demanding functional manipulation (inanimate objects) and those demanding social manipulation (animate objects), even though specialized hand preference based on target animacy has not been fully established in this arboreal Old World monkey species.",
  "28003476": "Efficient DNA binding of NF-κB requires the chaperone -like function of NPM1 NPM1/nucleophosmin is frequently overexpressed in various tumors, although the oncogenic role of NPM1 remains unclear. Here we revealed the link between NPM1 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a master regulator of inflammation. We found that NPM1 knockdown decreased NF-κB -mediated transcription of selected target genes by decreasing the recruitment of NF-κB p65 to the gene promoters. NPM1 is directly associated with the DNA binding domain of p65 to enhance its DNA binding activity without being a part of the DNA - NF-κB complex. This result suggests that NF-κB requires the chaperone -like function of NPM1 for DNA binding. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NPM1 was required for efficient inflammatory gene expression induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharide in fibroblasts and macrophages. The NF-κB - mediated invasion of breast cancer cells was significantly decreased by NPM1 knockdown. Our study suggests a novel mechanistic insight into the NF-κB -mediated transcription and an oncogenic role of NPM1 in both tumor cells and the tumor micro-environment through the regulation of NF-κB.",
  "28463704": "Recovery of orthographic processing after stroke: A longitudinal fMRI study An intact orthographic processing system is critical for normal reading and spelling. Here we investigate the neural changes associated with impairment and subsequent recovery of the orthographic lexical processing system in an individual with an ischemic left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. This work describes a longitudinal case study of a patient, whose initials are MMY, with impairments in orthographic lexical processing for reading and spelling at stroke onset, and who recovered these skills within 1 year post stroke. We tested the hypothesis that this acute impairment to reading and spelling would be associated with a selective loss of neural activation in the left fusiform gyrus (FG), and that subsequent recovery would be associated with a gain of neural activation in this region. MMY's case provided a unique opportunity to assess the selectivity of neural changes because she demonstrated a behavioral recovery of naming as well; i.e., if there is neural recovery for reading and spelling, but not naming, then these neural changes are selective to the recovery of orthographic processing. To test our hypothesis, we examined longitudinal behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of reading, spelling, and visual object naming acquired acutely, 3 weeks, 5 months, and one year post stroke. In confirmation of our hypothesis, the loss and subsequent gain of orthographic lexical processing was associated with up-regulation of neural activation in areas previously associated with orthographic lexical processing: i.e., the left mid-FG and inferior frontal junction (IFJ). Furthermore, these neural changes were found to be selective to orthographic processing, as they were observed for reading and spelling, but not for visual object naming within the left mid-FG. This work shows that left PCA stroke can temporarily and selectively disrupt the orthographic lexical processing system, not only in the posterior region adjacent to the stroke, but also in relatively distant frontal orthographic processing regions.",
  "28075453": "miR-375 inhibits cancer stem cell phenotype and tamoxifen resistance by degrading HOXB3 in human ER-positive breast cancer Cancer stem cell (CSC) formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are pivotal events in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. They have been shown to occur in resistance to tamoxifen. Moreover, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been associated with CSCs, EMT as well as tamoxifen resistance. Studying molecular mechanism of CSCs, EMT as well as tamoxifen resistance will help us to further understand the pathogenesis and progression of the disease and offer new targets for effective therapies. In the present study, we showed that miR-375 inhibits CSC traits in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation identified HOXB3 as a direct target of miR-375. Overexpressing miR-375 degraded HOXB3 mRNA in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, overexpression of HOXB3 induced formation of CSC phenotypes, EMT and tamoxifen - resistance as well as enhanced ability of migration and invasion in MCF-7 cells. Most ER-positive breast cancer -related deaths occur, because of resistance to standard therapies and metastasis, restoring miR-375 or targeting HOXB3 might serve as potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.",
  "27393252": "Parkinson subtype -specific Granger-causal coupling and coherence frequency in the subthalamic area Previous work on Parkinson's disease (PD) has indicated a predominantly afferent coupling between affected arm muscle activity and electrophysiological activity within the subthalamic nucleus (STN). So far, no information is available indicating which frequency components drive the afferent information flow in PD patients. Non-directional coupling e.g. by measuring coherence is primarily established in the beta band as well as at tremor frequency. Based on previous evidence it is likely that different subtypes of the disease are associated with different connectivity patterns. Therefore, we determined coherence and causality between local field potentials (LFPs) in the STN and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from the contralateral arm in 18 akinetic-rigid (AR) PD patients and 8 tremor-dominant (TD) PD patients. During the intraoperative recording, patients were asked to lift their forearm contralateral to the recording side. Significantly more afferent connections were detected for the TD patients for tremor -periods and non- tremor -periods combined as well as for only tremor periods. Within the STN 74% and 63% of the afferent connections are associated with coherence from 4-8Hz and 8-12Hz, respectively. However, when considering only tremor -periods significantly more afferent than efferent connections were associated with coherence from 12 to 20Hz across all recording heights. No difference between efferent and afferent connections is seen in the frequency range from 4 to 12Hz for all recording heights. For the AR patients, no significant difference in afferent and efferent connections within the STN was found for the different frequency bands. Still, for the AR patients dorsal of the STN significantly more afferent than efferent connections were associated with coherence in the frequency range from 12 to 16Hz. These results provide further evidence for the differential pathological oscillations and pathways present in AR and TD Parkinson patients.",

The influence of the NIPAm, AA and MBA amount on properties of xylan-based hydrogels was discussed. The morphology and interactions of hydrogels were characterized by SEM and FTIR. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of hydrogels was investigated by DSC. The results indicated that the LCST of hydrogels emerged at around 34°C and increased with increasing the AA content. The drug encapsulation efficiency of as-prepared hydrogels reached to 97.60% and the cumulative release rate of acetylsalicylic acid was 90.12% and 26.35% in the intestinal and gastric fluid, respectively.

  "28146639": "Fifty Years of Research in ARDS. Setting Positive End-expiratory Pressure in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been utilized during mechanical ventilation since the first description of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the subsequent decades, many different strategies for optimally titrating PEEP have been proposed. Higher PEEP can improve arterial oxygenation, reduce tidal lung stress and strain, and promote more homogenous ventilation by preventing alveolar collapse at end expiration. However, PEEP may also cause circulatory depression and contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury through alveolar overdistention. The overall effect of PEEP is primarily related to the balance between the number of alveoli that are recruited to participate in ventilation and the amount of lung that is overdistended when PEEP is applied. Techniques to assess lung recruitment from PEEP may help to direct safer and more effective PEEP titration. Some PEEP titration strategies attempt to weigh beneficial effects on arterial oxygenation and on prevention of cyclic alveolar collapse with the harmful potential of overdistention. One method for PEEP titration is a PEEP / FiO2 table, which prioritizes support for arterial oxygenation. Other methods set PEEP based on mechanical parameters such as the plateau pressure, respiratory system compliance, or transpulmonary pressure. No single method of PEEP titration has been shown to improve clinical outcomes compared to other approaches of setting PEEP. Future trials should focus on identifying patients who respond to higher PEEP with recruitment and on clinically important outcomes such as mortality.",
  "27876369": "Multi-component model of intramural hematoma A novel multi-component model is introduced for studying interaction between blood flow and deforming aortic wall with intramural hematoma (IMH). The aortic wall is simulated by a composite structure submodel representing material properties of the three main wall layers. The IMH is described by a poroelasticity submodel which takes into account both the pressure inside hematoma and its deformation. The submodel of the hematoma is fully coupled with the aortic submodel as well as with the submodel of the pulsatile blood flow. Model simulations are used to investigate the relation between the peak wall stress, hematoma thickness and permeability in patients of different age. The results indicate that an increase in hematoma thickness leads to larger wall stress, which is in agreement with clinical data. Further simulations demonstrate that a hematoma with smaller permeability results in larger wall stress, suggesting that blood coagulation in hematoma might increase its mechanical stability. This is in agreement with previous experimental observations of coagulation having a beneficial effect on the condition of a patient with the IMH.",

We retrospectively analyzed the effect of prophylactic use of an oral DEX on fatigue during regorafenib treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A total of 105 patients who had received regorafenib at our institution from May 2013 to August 2014 were divided into 2 groups according to oral DEX use (2 mg/day; at the physician's discretion). Of the 105 patients, 31 received prophylactic DEX and 74 received regorafenib alone. The time to dose modification was significantly longer in the DEX group than in the no DEX group (15 days vs. 9 days; P = .009). The incidence of fatigue (grade ≥ 1) was significantly lower with DEX than without DEX (25.8% vs. 50.0%; P = .022). Fewer patients experienced a decreased appetite (grade ≥ 1; 3.2% vs. 35.1%; P < .001) and hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR; grade ≥ 3; 3.2% vs. 25.7%, P = .002) with DEX than without DEX. DEX was effective in reducing fatigue during regorafenib treatment, resulting in prolonging the time to dose modification for regorafenib. The decreased incidence of appetite loss and HFSR also suggest that concurrent DEX administration with regorafenib warrants further investigation.",

Although the ABO*A312 allele (c.280A>T, I94F) in an AwB case was registered in GenBank, the impact of the I94F mutation of the ABO gene on the activity of A transferase has not been studied. Transient transfection experiments were performed in HeLa cells using A101, A102, and A312 alleles synthesized by site-directed mutagenesis, and the functional expression level of A antigen was assessed by flow cytometry. The results showed that the A102 and A312 alleles expressed A antigen levels that were 80.28% and 19.32%, respectively, of that of the A101 allele. Our study results demonstrate that the c.280A>T variant is responsible for the weakened expression of A antigen.",
  "27508301": "Incidence of Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity and the Overlap of Comorbidities in HIV+ Hispanics Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading health threat for HIV+ patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART); cardiometabolic comorbidities are key predictors of risk. Data are limited on incidence of metabolic comorbidities in HIV+ individuals initiating ART in low and middle income countries (LMICs), particularly for Hispanics. We examined incidence of diabetes and obesity in a prospective cohort of those initiating ART in the Dominican Republic. Participants ≥18 years, initiating ART <90 days prior to study enrollment, were examined for incidence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), diabetes mellitus (DM), overweight, and obesity. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100-125mg/dl defined IFG; FPG ≥126 mg/dl, diagnosis per medical record, or use of hypoglycemic medication defined DM. Overweight and obesity were BMI 25-30 and ≥30kg/m2, respectively. Dyslipidemia was total cholesterol ≥240mg/dl or use of lipid-lowering medication. Framingham risk equation was used to determine ten-year CVD risk at the end of observation. Of 153 initiating ART, 8 (6%) had DM and 23 (16%) had IFG at baseline, 6 developed DM (28/1000 person - years follow up [PYFU]) and 46 developed IFG (329/1000 PYFU). At baseline, 24 (18%) were obese and 36 (27%) were overweight, 15 became obese (69/1000 PYFU) and 22 became overweight (163/1000 PYFU). Median observation periods for the diabetes and obesity analyses were 23.5 months and 24.3 months, respectively. Increased CVD risk (≥10% 10-year Framingham risk score) was present for 13% of the cohort; 79% of the cohort had ≥1 cardiometabolic comorbidity, 48% had ≥2, and 13% had all three. In this Hispanic cohort in an LMIC, incidences of IFG / DM and overweight / obesity were similar to or higher than that found in high income countries, and cardiometabolic disorders affected three-quarters of those initiating ART. Care models incorporating cardiovascular risk reduction into HIV treatment programs are needed to prevent CVD - associated mortality in this vulnerable population.",
  "28181538": "Epigenetic Editing of Ascl1 Gene in Neural Stem Cells by Optogenetics Enzymes involved in epigenetic processes such as methyltransferases or demethylases are becoming highly utilized for their persistent DNA or histone modifying efficacy. Herein, we have developed an optogenetic toolbox fused to the catalytic domain (CD) of DNA-methyltransferase3A (DNMT3A - CD) or Ten-Eleven Dioxygenase-1 (TET1 - CD) for loci - specific alteration of the methylation state at the promoter of Ascl1 (Mash1), a candidate proneuron gene. Optogenetical protein pairs, CRY2 linked to DNMT3A - CD or TET1 - CD and CIB1 fused to a Transcription Activator-Like Element (TALE) locating an Ascl1 promoter region, were designed for site specific epigenetic editing. A differentially methylated region at the Ascl1 promoter, isolated from murine dorsal root ganglion (hypermethylated) and striated cells (hypomethylated), was targeted with these optogenetic-epigenetic constructs. Optimized blue-light illumination triggered the co-localization of TALE constructs with DNMT3A - CD or TET1 - CD fusion proteins at the targeted site of the Ascl1 promoter. We found that this spatiotemporal association of the fusion proteins selectively alters the methylation state and also regulates gene activity. This proof of concept developed herein holds immense promise for the ability to regulate gene activity via epigenetic modulation with spatiotemporal precision.",
  "27669157": "A Patient Registry to Improve Patient Safety: Recording General Neurosurgery Complications To improve the transparency of the local health care system, treatment cost was recently referenced to disease related groups. Treatment quality must be legally documented in a patient registry, in particular for the highly specialized treatments provided by neurosurgery departments. In 2013 we have installed a patient registry focused on cranial neurosurgery. Surgeries are characterized by indication, treatment, location and other specific neurosurgical parameters. Preoperative state and postoperative outcome are recorded prospectively using neurological and sociological scales. Complications are graded by their severity in a therapy-oriented complication score system (Clavien-Dindo-Grading system, CDG). Results are presented at the monthly clinical staff meeting. Data acquisition compatible with the clinic workflow permitted to include all eligible patients into the registry. Until December 2015, we have registered 2880 patients that were treated in 3959 surgeries and 8528 consultations. Since the registry is fully operational (August 2014), we have registered 325 complications on 1341 patient discharge forms (24%). In 64% of these complications, no or only pharmacological treatment was required. At discharge, there was a clear correlation of the severity of the complication and the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS, ρ = -0.3, slope -6 KPS percentage points per increment of CDG) and the length of stay (ρ = 0.4, slope 1.5 days per increment of CDG). While the therapy-oriented complication scores correlate reasonably well with outcome and length of stay, they do not account for new deficits that cannot be treated. Outcome grading and complication severity grading thus serve a complimentary purpose. Overall, the registry serves to streamline and to complete information flow in the clinic, to identify complication rates and trends early for the internal quality monitoring and communication with patients. Conversely, the registry influences clinical practice in that it demands rigorous documentation and standard operating procedures.",
  "27427386": "Biochemical evidence for a mitochondrial genetic modifier in the phenotypic manifestation of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy -associated mitochondrial DNA mutation Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is the most common mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial modifiers are proposed to modify the phenotypic expression of primary LHON -associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. In this study, we demonstrated that the LHON susceptibility allele (m.14502T > C, p. 58I > V) in the ND6 gene modulated the phenotypic expression of primary LHON -associated m.11778G > A mutation. Twenty-two Han Chinese pedigrees carrying m.14502T > C and m.11778G > A mutations exhibited significantly higher penetrance of optic neuropathy than those carrying only m.11778G > A mutation. We performed functional assays using the cybrid cell models, generated by fusing mtDNA-less ρ(o) cells with enucleated cells from LHON patients carrying both m.11778G > A and m.14502T > C mutations, only m.14502T > C or m.11778G > A mutation and a control belonging to the same mtDNA haplogroup. These cybrids cell lines bearing m.14502T > C mutation exhibited mild effects on mitochondrial functions compared with those carrying only m.11778G > A mutation. However, more severe mitochondrial dysfunctions were observed in cell lines bearing both m.14502T > C and m.11778G > A mutations than those carrying only m.11778G > A or m.14502T > C mutation. In particular, the m.14502T > C mutation altered assemble of complex I, thereby aggravating the respiratory phenotypes associated with m.11778G > A mutation, resulted in a more defective complex I. Furthermore, more reductions in the levels of mitochondrial ATP and increasing production of reactive oxygen species were also observed in mutant cells bearing both m.14502T > C and m.11778G > A mutation than those carrying only 11778G > A mutation. Our findings provided new insights into the pathophysiology of LHON that were manifested by interaction between primary and secondary mtDNA mutations.",

  "28338376": "Pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer In the last years, a spectacular development of immunotherapeutic agents aimed at the PD-1 / PD-L1 axis has taken place. This development of these checkpoint inhibitors has greatly influenced our approach to the treatment of lung cancer in first and second line. The limited toxicity profile and the ability to treat for prolonged periods, even in smokers, is a welcome expansion of the therapeutic arsenal of the oncologist. Areas covered: This review highlights the results of recent clinical trials on pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The authors discuss both first and second line treatment with pembrolizumab as monotherapy and in combination therapies. Additionally, implications of the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay with the 22C3 antibody and its use in clinical practice and trials is discussed. Expert commentary: A higher overall response, overall survival and a moderate toxicity profile is observed with the use of pembrolizumab, compared to chemotherapy, in both first and second line. These promising results have already translated into the registration of pembrolizumab in first and second line in patients with a high expression of PD-L1. However, as PD-L1 staining does not sufficiently discriminate responders from non-responders for all checkpoint inhibitors, there still is a need for a better predictive biomarker.",
  "28341161": "Predictive position computations mediated by parietal areas: TMS evidence When objects move or the eyes move, the visual system can predict the consequence and generate a percept of the target at its new position. This predictive localization may depend on eye movement control in the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and on motion analysis in the medial temporal area (MT). Across two experiments we examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over right FEF, right IPS, righ t MT, and a control site, peripheral V1 / V2, diminished participants ' perception of two cases of predictive position perception: trans-saccadic fusion, and the flash grab illusion, both presented in the contralateral visual field. In trans-saccadic fusion trials, participants saccade toward a stimulus that is replaced with another stimulus during the saccade. Frequently, predictive position mechanisms lead to a fused percept of pre - and post - saccade stimuli (Paeye et al., 2017). We found that rTMS to IPS significantly decreased the frequency of perceiving trans-saccadic fusion within the first 10min after stimulation. In the flash grab illusion, a target is flashed on a moving background leading to the percept that the target has shifted in the direction of the motion after the flash (Cavanagh and Anstis, 2013). In the first experiment, the reduction in the flash grab illusion after rTMS to IPS and FEF did not reach significance. In the second experiment, using a stronger version of the flash grab, the illusory shift did decrease significantly after rTMS to IPS although not after rTMS to FEF or to MT. These findings suggest that right IPS contributes to predictive position perception during saccades and motion processing in the contralateral visual field.",

To explore the experiences of participants who completed their respective home exercise programmes. Thirty volunteer participants aged between 30 and 60 years and diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis or hand osteoarthritis were proposed for a single-center, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01635582). Participants received task-oriented training with interactive computer games and objects of daily life or finger mobility and strengthening exercises. Both programmes were home based and were done four sessions per week with 20 minutes each session for 6 weeks. Major feasibility outcomes were number of volunteers screened, randomized, and retained; completion of blinded assessments, exercise training, and home exercise sessions; equipment and data management; and clinical outcomes of hand function. Reaching the recruitment target in 18 months and achieving exercise compliance >80% were set as success criteria. Concurrent with the trial, focus group interviews explored experiences of those participants who completed their respective programmes. After trial initiation, revisions in inclusion criteria were required to promote recruitment. A total of 17 participants were randomized and 15 were retained. Completion of assessments, exercise training, and home exercise sessions; equipment and data collection and management demonstrated excellent feasibility. Both groups improved in hand function outcomes and exercise compliance was above 85%. Participants perceived both programmes as appropriate and acceptable. Participants who completed task-oriented training also agreed that playing different computer games was enjoyable, engaging, and motivating. Findings demonstrate initial evidence on recruitment, feasibility of trial procedures, and acceptability of task-oriented training in people with rheumatoid arthritis or hand osteoarthritis. Since the pilot trial was unsuccessful in participant recruitment, a large trial will not follow.",
  "28341674": "Interbacterial Adhesion Networks within Early Oral Biofilms of Single Human Hosts Specific interbacterial adhesion, termed coaggregation, is well established for three early colonizers of the plaque biofilm: streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellae. However, little is known about interactions of other early colonizers and about the extent of interactions within the bacterial community from a single host. To address these gaps, subject - specific culture collections from two individuals were established using an intraoral biofilm retrieval device. Molecular taxonomy (Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray [HOMIM]) analysis of biofilm samples confirmed the integrity and completeness of the collections. HOMIM analysis verified the isolation of Streptococcus gordonii and S. anginosus from only one subject, as well as isolation of a previously uncultivated streptococcal phylotype from the other subject. Strains representative of clonal diversity within each collection were further characterized. Greater than 70% of these streptococcal strains from each subject coaggregated with at least one other coisolate. One-third of the strains carry a known coaggregation mediator: receptor polysaccharide (RPS). Almost all nonstreptococcal isolates coaggregated with other coisolates. Importantly, certain Rothia strains demonstrated more coaggregations with their coisolated bacteria than did any Streptococcus or Actinomyces strain, and certain Haemophilus isolates participated in twice as many. Confocal microscopy of undisturbed biofilms showed that Rothia and Haemophilus each occur in small multispecies microcolonies. However, in confluent high - biomass regions, Rothia occurred in islands whereas Haemophilus was distributed throughout. Together, the data demonstrate that coaggregation networks within an individual's oral microflora are extensive and that Rothia and Haemophilus can be important initiators of cell-cell interactions in the early biofilm .IMPORTANCE Extensive involvement of specific interbacterial adhesion in dental plaque biofilm formation has been postulated based on in vitro coaggregation between oral bacteria from culture collections that are not subject specific. In the present study, subject - specific culture collections were obtained from early plaque biofilm of two volunteers, and coaggregations within each culture collection were assayed. Coaggregations, several of which involved a coaggregation -mediating cell surface molecule known from well-studied streptococci, were widespread. Unexpectedly, the little-studied organisms Haemophilus and Rothia participated in the greatest numbers of interactions with community members; these two organisms showed different distributions within the undisturbed biofilm. The data show that coaggregation networks encompass most organisms within the biofilm community of each individual, and they indicate prominent participation of organisms such as Haemophilus and Rothia in early plaque biofilm formation.",

  "27702924": "Effect of acute heat stress and slaughter processing on poultry meat quality and postmortem carbohydrate metabolism This study investigated the effects of acute heat stress and slaughter processing on poultry meat quality and carbohydrate metabolism. Broilers (200) were randomly divided into 2 groups receiving heat stress (HS; 36°C for one h), compared to a non-stressed control (C). At slaughter, each group was further divided into 2 groups for slaughter processing (L = laboratory; F = commercial factory). L group breasts were removed immediately after bleeding without carcass scalding or defeathering, and stored at 4°C. F group broilers were scalded (60°C, 45 s) after bleeding and defeathering. Then the breasts were removed and cooled in ice water until the core temperature was ≤4°C. Rates of Pectoralis core temperature and pH decline were changed by slaughter processing, but only HS affected ultimate pH in group L. HS muscles had higher L * values (P < 0.05) than controls at 24 h postmortem. Laboratory processing \" hot-deboning \" increased drip loss, which resulted in a lower cooked loss (P < 0.05). Postmortem glycolysis was affected only by HS. The speed of lactic acid accumulation and glycogen degradation was faster in the HS group than controls at 5 min postmortem. During storage the glycolysis rates were not different (P > 0.05). Sarcoplasmic protein solubility was higher in F processed birds (P < 0.05). HS decreased the solubility of myofibrillar and total protein in the L - slaughtered birds. Thus, HS caused a higher frequency of accelerated muscle glycolysis than controls. Factory processing (chilling) could not completely eliminate the effects of accelerated glycolysis caused by pre- slaughter HS.",
  "28436493": "An attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strain with a defect in ESX-1 secretion induces minimal host immune responses and pathology Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) DK9897 is an attenuated strain, it was isolated from a patient with extrapulmonary tuberculosis and vaccination with a subunit vaccine (H56) induced poor protection against it. Both attenuation and lack of protection are because M.tb DK9897 cannot secrete the EsxA virulence factor nor induce a host response against it. Genome sequencing identified a frameshift mutation in the eccCa1 gene. Since the encoded EccCa1 protein provides energy for ESX-1 secretion, it suggested a defect in the ESX-1 type VII secretion system. Genetic complementation with a plasmid carrying the M.tb H37Rv sequence of eccCa1-eccCb1-pe35 re-established EsxA secretion, host specific EsxA T-cell responses, and increased strain virulence. The ESX-1 secretion defect prevents several virulence factors from being functional during infection and therefore attenuates M.tb. It precludes specific T-cell responses against strong antigens and we found very little in vivo cytokine production, gross pathology or granuloma formation in lungs from M.tb DK9897 infected animals. This coincides with M.tb DK9897 being unable to disrupt the phagosome membrane and make contact to the cytosol.",
  "27771196": "Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Hyperintensity Is Associated with Hemorrhagic Transformation following Reperfusion Therapy It is still controversial whether early fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity within acute ischemic lesions carries the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after reperfusion therapy. Furthermore, the association between the location of FLAIR hyperintensity and HT has not been investigated. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent reperfusion therapy within 6 hours of stroke onset and magnetic resonance imaging including a FLAIR sequence before completing reperfusion therapy. FLAIR hyperintensity within the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion was rated qualitatively, and HT was assessed on follow-up gradient echo imaging. The location of the FLAIR change and HT was classified as subcortical, cortical, or cortico-subcortical. Of 134 patients with acute ischemic stroke included in this study, early FLAIR changes within DWI lesions were identified in 56 (41.8%) patients, and HT was noted in 51 (38.1%) patients. FLAIR change was independently associated with HT (odds ratio: 4.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.72-11.12). Geographically, 48.2% of the patients with a FLAIR change developed a matched HT (restricted to the region with the FLAIR change), and the risk of HT was further increased in patients with a FLAIR change in the cortico-subcortical region (68.8%). In patients in the acute stage of stroke, an early FLAIR change is associated with the risk of HT following reperfusion therapy with a highly matched geographic relationship and common risk factors. Thus, identification of FLAIR change may be a useful surrogate marker to assess the likelihood of subsequent HT in patients treated with reperfusion therapy.",

Men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with primary prostate cryotherapy from 1993-2013 were selected from the Cryo On-Line Data Registry for a 1:1 matched comparison between those undergoing whole - gland and partial prostate cryotherapy (targeted-ablation, unilateral/bilateral nerve-sparing ablations). A propensity score was developed based on age, pre-biopsy serum PSA, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, prostate volume, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation status, year of surgery and pre-treatment potency. Outcomes were biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) using ASTRO and Phoenix criteria, 12-month continence (strictly pad-free) and sexual function (potency sufficient for sexual intercourse). After propensity score - matching, BPFS was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and functional outcomes using chi-square tests. In all, 897 men were identified (731 whole - gland and 166 partial). Post-matching, 166 pairs of men were analysed (mean follow-up 31 months). The 2/5 year BPFS rate was 87.2%/76.4% for whole - gland vs. 80.7%/70.0% for partial ablation using Phoenix (p=0.26) and 72.3%/69.6% for whole gland vs. 82.1%/75.0% for partial ablation using ASTRO criteria (p=0.10). Of 164 pairs, the 12-month continence rate was similar 94.1% vs. 95.1% (p=0.803). Of 139 pairs, the 12-month rate of successful intercourse was 29.5% for whole - gland and 46.8% for partial ablation (OR 2.1, p=0.003). The incidence of post-treatment urinary retention was 6.0% and 6.6% (p=0.88) following whole - gland and partial ablation respectively and that of rectourethral fistula was 1.2% and 0% (p=0.50) Conclusion: Partial ablation results in better post-treatment sexual function compared to whole - gland ablation in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

  "28187742": "Regulatory role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha in the induction of CD40 in microglia The aberrant expression of CD40, a co-stimulatory receptor found on the antigen-presenting cells, is involved in the pathogenesis of various degenerative diseases. Our previous study demonstrated that the reduction of cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2α) protein overexpression and activation in the spinal cord of a mouse model of ALS, hmSOD1 G93A, inhibited CD40 upregulation in microglia. The present study was designed to determine whether cPLA2α has a direct, participatory role in the molecular events leading to CD40 induction. Cultures of primary mouse microglia or BV-2 microglia cell line exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon gamma (IFNγ) for different periods of time, in order to study the role of cPLA2α in the events leading to CD40 protein induction. Addition of LPS or IFNγ caused a significant upregulation of cPLA2α and of CD40, while prevention of cPLA2α upregulation by a specific oligonucleotide antisense (AS) prevented the induction of CD40, suggesting a role of cPLA2α in the induction of CD40. Addition of LPS to microglia caused an immediate activation of cPLA2α detected by its phosphorylated form, while addition of IFNγ induced cPLA2α activation at a later time scale (4 h). The activation of cPLA2α is mediated by ERK activity. Suppression of cPLA2α activity inhibited superoxide production by NOX2-NADPH oxidase and activation of NF-κB detected by the phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 at 15 min by LPS and at 4 h by IFNγ. Inhibition of NOX2 prevented NF-κB activation and CD40 induction but did not affect cPLA2α activation, suggesting cPLA2α is located upstream to NOX2 and NF-κB. The activation of cPLA2 by LPS was mediated by both adaptor proteins downstream to LPS receptor; TRIF and MyD88, while the activation of cPLA2α by IFNγ was mediated by the secreted TNF-α at 4 h. The early activation of STAT1α (detected by phospho-serine727 and phoshpo-tyrosine701) by IFNγ and the late activation of STAT1α by LPS were not affected in the presence of cPLA2α inhibitors, indicating that STAT1α is not under cPLA2α regulation. Our results show for the first time that cPLA2 upregulates CD40 protein expression induced by either LPS or IFNγ, and this regulatory effect is mediated via the activation of NOX2-NADPH oxidase and NF-κB. Cumulatively, our results indicate that cPLA2α may serve as a pivotal amplifier of the inflammatory response in the CNS.",

Because of extended appointment lead-time, women with high-risk pregnancy could develop severe complications in their health status and put their babies at risk. This problem was detected through a project selection process explained in this article and to solve it, Six Sigma methodology has been used. First, the process was defined through a SIPOC diagram to identify its input and output variables. Second, six sigma performance indicators were calculated to establish the process baseline. Then, a fishbone diagram was used to determine the possible causes of the problem. These causes were validated with the aid of correlation analysis and other statistical tools. Later, improvement strategies were designed to reduce appointment lead-time in this department. Project results evidenced that average appointment lead-time reduced from 6,89 days to 4,08 days and the deviation standard dropped from 1,57 days to 1,24 days. In this way, the hospital will serve pregnant women faster, which represents a risk reduction of perinatal and maternal mortality.",
  "28068871": "Predilation technique with balloon angioplasty to facilitate percutaneous groin access of large size sheath through scar tissue Purpose Percutaneous remote access for endovascular aortic repair is an advantageous alternative to open access. Previous surgery in the femoral region and the presence of synthetic vascular grafts in the femoral / iliac arteries represent major limitations to percutaneous remote access. The aim of this study was to evaluate an original technique used for enabling percutaneous remote access for thoracic or abdominal endovascular aortic repair in patients with scar tissue and/or a vascular graft in the groin. Methods Twenty-five consecutive patients with a thoracic (11/25; 44%) or an aortic aneurysm (14/25; 66%) and with a synthetic vascular graft in the groin (16/25; 64%) or a redo groin access (9/25; 36%) were managed through the percutaneous remote access. In all patients, a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon was used to predilate the scar tissue and the femoral artery or the synthetic vascular graft after preclosing (ProGlide®; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA). In 10 patients, requiring a 20 Fr sheath, a 6 mm percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon was used; and in the remaining 15, requiring a 24 Fr sheath, an 8 mm percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon. Preclosing was exclusively performed using ProGlide®. Mean follow-up was 15 months. Results In all cases, stent-graft deployment was successful. There was one surgical conversion (4%; 1/25) due to bleeding from a femoral anastomosis. Two cases required additional percutaneous maneuvers (postclosing with another system in one patient and endoluminal shielding with stent-graft in the other patient). No pseudoaneurysm or access complication occurred during the follow-up. Conclusions Percutaneous access in redo groins with scar tissue and/or synthetic vascular graft using ultrasound-guided punction, preclosing with ProGlide® system and predilation with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon to introduce large size sheath as used for endovascular aortic repair showed to be feasible, safe and with few local complications.",

Herein we create a novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe, 4-mercaptophenol (4-MP)-functionalized gold flowers (AuF / MP), for imaging and biosensing of ClO(-) and GSH in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells upon oxidative stress. The SERS spectra of AuF / MP change with the reaction between ClO(-) and 4-MP on AuFs within 1 min and then recover after reaction with GSH, resulting in the ratiometric detection of ClO(-) and GSH with high accuracy. The single SERS probe also shows high selectivity for ClO(-) and GSH detection against other reactive oxygen species and amino acids which may exist in biological systems, as well as remarkable sensitivity ascribed to a larger amount of hot spots on AuFs. The significant analytical performance of the developed nanoprobe, together with good biocompatibility and high cell-permeability, enables the present SERS probe imaging and real-time detection of ClO(-) and GSH in live cells upon oxidative stress.",

The mean ejection fraction was 57.7±10.8%. The mean reference vessel diameter and CTO lesion length were 3.0±0.4 and 20.2±3.0 mm, respectively. The mean number of BVS deployed per patient was 1.8±0.7, of which mean diameter and total length were 3.0±0.4 and 47.6±19.9 mm, respectively. Postdilatation with noncompliant balloons (mean diameter 3.3±0.3 mm) was performed at high pressures (18.6±5.3 atm) in all cases. Intravascular ultrasound (n=34) or optical coherence tomography (n=31) was performed in all cases. During the follow-up period (median: 453 days, 25th and 75th percentiles: 230 and 703), there were no occurrences of target lesion failure or scaffold thrombosis. BVS implantation for the treatment of CTO seems feasible and safe. Appropriate lesion preparation, high-pressure postdilatation, and the use of intravascular imaging are recommended to obtain the best possible final result.",

However, complications may be increased in small infants. We evaluated our single-institution GJT complication rate and systematically reviewed existing literature. With REB approval, a retrospective single-institution analysis of GJT placements between 2009 and 2015 was performed. For the systematic review, MOOSE guidelines were followed. At our institution, 48 children underwent 154/159 successful insertions primarily for gastroesophageal reflux (n=27; 55%) and aspiration (n=11; 23%). Median age at first GJT insertion was 2.2years (0.2-18). Thirty-five (73%) had an index insertion when ≤10kg. GJTs caused 2 perforations and 1 death. The systematic review assessed 48 articles representing 2726 procedures. Overall perforation rate was estimated as 2.1% (n=36 studies, 23/1092, 95% CI: 1.0-3.2). Perforation rates in children <10kg versus ≥10kg were estimated as 3.1%/ procedure (95% CI: 1.1%-5.0%) and 0.1%/ procedure (95% CI: 0%-0.3%), respectively. The relative risk of perforation was 9.4 (95% CI: 2.8-31.3). Overall mortality was estimated as 0.9%/ patient (n=39 studies; 95% CI: 0.2-1.6%). Most perforations (19/23; 83%) occurred ≤30days of attempted tube placement. Gastrojejunostomy tubes are associated with significant complications and frequently require revision/replacement. Insertion in patients <10kg is associated with increased perforation risk. Caution is warranted in this subgroup. Level II.",
  "27313637": "Steamed and Fermented Ethanolic Extract from Codonopsis lanceolata Attenuates Amyloid-β - Induced Memory Impairment in Mice Codonopsis lanceolata (C. lanceolata) is a traditional medicinal plant used for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases such as asthma, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis. We evaluated whether steamed and fermented C. lanceolata (SFC) extract improves amyloid-β - (Aβ-) induced learning and memory impairment in mice. The Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests were used to evaluate the effect of SFC extract. Moreover, we investigated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in the hippocampus of mice to determine a possible mechanism for the cognitive - enhancing effect. Saponin compounds in SFC were identified by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). SFC extract ameliorated amyloid-β - induced memory impairment in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. SFC extract inhibited AChE activity and also significantly increased the level of CREB phosphorylation, BDNF expression, and ERK activation in hippocampal tissue of amyloid-β - treated mice. Lancemasides A, B, C, D, E, and G and foetidissimoside A compounds present in SFC were determined by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. These results indicate that SFC extract improves Aβ - induced memory deficits and that AChE inhibition and CREB / BDNF / ERK expression is important for the effect of the SFC extract. In addition, lancemaside A specifically may be responsible for efficacious effect of SFC.",
  "27318951": "Preventing Youth Internalizing Symptoms Through the Familias Unidas Intervention: Examining Variation in Response Prevention programs that strengthen parenting and family functioning have been found to reduce poor behavioral outcomes in adolescents, including substance use, HIV risk, externalizing and internalizing problems. However, there is evidence that not all youth benefit similarly from these programs. Familias Unidas is a family-focused intervention designed to prevent substance use and sexual risk among Hispanic youth and has recently demonstrated unanticipated reductions in internalizing symptoms for some youth. This paper examines variation in intervention response for internalizing symptoms using individual-level data pooled across four distinct Familias Unidas trials: (1) 266 eighth grade students recruited from the general school population; (2) 160 ninth grade students from the general school population; (3) 213 adolescents with conduct, aggression, and/or attention problems; and (4) 242 adolescents with a delinquency history. Causal inference growth mixture modeling suggests a three- class model. The two largest classes represent youth with low (60 %) and medium (27 %) internalizing symptoms at baseline, and both intervention and control participants show reductions in internalizing symptoms. The third class (13 %) represents youth with high levels of baseline internalizing symptoms who remain at steady levels of internalizing symptoms when exposed to the intervention, but who experience an increase in symptoms under the control condition. Female gender, low baseline levels of parent - adolescent communication, and older age were associated with membership in the high-risk class. These synthesis analyses involving a large sample of youth with varying initial risk levels represent a further step toward strengthening our knowledge of preventive intervention response and improving preventive interventions.",

This study aims to investigate the outcomes of a phased CCRT protocol established to maximize the operability of marginally operable stage IIIA NSCLC and to care for reassessed inoperable patients, in comparison with continuous-course definitive CCRT. Forty-seven patients with marginally operable stage IIIA NSCLC receiving CCRT were included. Twenty-eight patients were treated with our phased CCRT protocol, including neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery (group A, n = 16) or, for reassessed inoperable patients, maintenance chemotherapy and split-course CCRT boost (group B, n = 12). The other 19 were treated with continuous-course definitive CCRT (group C). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. Among all, median OS and PFS were 35.6 and 12.8 months, respectively (median follow-up, 22.3 months). The median OS of group A (not reached) was better than that of group B (34.4 months) and group C (15.2 months) (P = .009). On multivariate analysis, performance status 0 to 1 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.026; P < .001), adenocarcinoma (HR, 0.156; P = .003), and group A (HR, 0.199; P = .033) were independent prognostic factors. The OS of group B (HR, 0.450; 95% confidence interval, 0.118-1.717; P = .243) was not statistically different from that of group C. For marginally operable stage IIIA NSCLC, our phased CCRT strategy may optimize survival by maximizing operability and maintain an acceptable survival for reassessed inoperable patients by split-course CCRT boost following maintenance chemotherapy.",
  "27321892": "Dual-color STED microscopy reveals a sandwich structure of Bassoon and Piccolo in active zones of adult and aged mice Presynaptic active zones play a pivotal role as synaptic vesicle release sites for synaptic transmission, but the molecular architecture of active zones in mammalian neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) at sub-diffraction limited resolution remains unknown. Bassoon and Piccolo are active zone specific cytosolic proteins essential for active zone assembly in NMJs, ribbon synapses, and brain synapses. These proteins are thought to colocalize and share some functions at active zones. Here, we report an unexpected finding of non-overlapping localization of these two proteins in mouse NMJs revealed using dual-color stimulated emission depletion (STED) super resolution microscopy. Piccolo puncta sandwiched Bassoon puncta and aligned in a Piccolo - Bassoon - Piccolo structure in adult NMJs. P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) puncta colocalized with Bassoon puncta. The P/Q-type VGCC and Bassoon protein levels decreased significantly in NMJs from aged mouse. In contrast, the Piccolo levels in NMJs from aged mice were comparable to levels in adult mice. This study revealed the molecular architecture of active zones in mouse NMJs at sub-diffraction limited resolution, and described the selective degeneration mechanism of active zone proteins in NMJs from aged mice. Interestingly, the localization pattern of active zone proteins described herein is similar to active zone structures described using electron microscope tomography.",
  "28194562": "The Iboga Alkaloids Iboga alkaloids are a particular class of indolomonoterpenes most often characterized by an isoquinuclidine nucleus. Their first occurrence was detected in the roots of Tabernanthe iboga, a sacred plant to the people of Gabon, which made it cult object. Ibogaine is the main representative of this class of alkaloids and its psychoactive properties are well documented. It has been proposed as a drug cessation treatment and has a wide range of activities in targeting opioids, cocaine, and alcohol. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a background on this molecule and related compounds and to update knowledge on the most recent advances made. Difficulties linked to the status of ibogaine as a drug in several countries have hampered its development, but 18-methoxycoronaridine is currently under evaluation for the same purposes and for the treatment of leishmaniasis. The chapter is divided into six parts: an introduction aiming at defining what is called an iboga alkaloid, and this is followed by current knowledge on their biosynthesis, which unfortunately remains a \" black box \" as far as the key construction step is concerned. Many of these alkaloids are still being discovered and the third and fourth parts of the chapter discuss the analytical tools in use for this purpose and give lists of new monomeric and dimeric alkaloids belonging to this class. When necessary, the structures are discussed especially with regard to absolute configuration determinations, which remain a point of weakness in their assignments. Part V gives an account of progress made in the synthesis, partial and total, which the authors believe is key to providing solid solutions to the industrial development of the most promising molecules. The last part of the chapter is devoted to the biological properties of iboga alkaloids, with particular emphasis on ibogaine and 18-methoxycoronaridine.",

Comprehensive metabolite analysis may reveal the anaphylactoid effect mechanism systematically and provide reference for future diagnostic purposes. Plasma from Brown Norway rats given intravenous injection of saline, compound 48/80 (2.5 mL/kg) or ovalbumin (20 mL/kg) in 20 s for the first time was used to study the effect mechanism of anaphylactoid reactions through metabolomics (UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS). Metabolomics integrated with proteomics data were used to analyze the anaphylactoid pathways by MetaboAnalyst followed by integrated pathway analysis. Thirty metabolites were identified through the METLIN database by MS/MS and 18 of them were confirmed by authentic standards. The results showed that adenosine, histamine, N-acetylhistamine, N(α)-γ-glutamylhistamine, malate and xanthine are important indices for anaphylactoid reactions. It could be concluded that the effect mechanism is mainly composed of histidine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, energy metabolism, purine metabolism and other small molecules through 30 metabolites. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that not only histamine but also N(α)-γ-glutamylhistamine and arachidonic acid could be used to evaluate anaphylactoid symptoms of animals. Furthermore, the citrate cycle, histidine metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism could be the main pathways of anaphylactoid reactions as determined by MetaboAnalyst. The results may provide a reference to improve diagnostic accuracy and predict and monitor treatment efficacy in anaphylactoid reactions in the clinical setting.",
  "27859167": "Variation in the age of first reproduction: different strategies or individual quality? Although age at first reproduction is a key demographic parameter that is probably under high selective pressure, it is highly variable and the cause of this variability is not well understood. Two non-exclusive hypotheses may explain such variability. It could be the expression of different individual strategies, i.e., different allocation strategies in fitness components, or the consequences of individual difference in intrinsic quality, i.e., some individuals always doing better than others in all fitness components. We tested these hypotheses in the Wandering Albatross investigating relationships between the age at first reproduction and subsequent adult demographic traits. Using finite mixture capture recapture modeling, we demonstrate that the age at first reproduction is negatively related to both reproductive performances and adult survival, suggesting that individual quality was an important factor explaining variation in the age at first reproduction. Our results suggest that age at first breeding is a good predictor of quality in this long-lived seabird species.",

Data were derived from the HELIUS study in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We included 23,126 participants aged 18-70 years of Dutch, South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish, and Moroccan origin. We collected self-reported data on PED, current smoking, heavy smoking, nicotine dependence, current drinking, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence. Logistic regression was used. In general, we observed positive associations in participants of African Surinamese and Ghanaian origin, but no associations in those of South-Asian Surinamese, Turkish, or Moroccan origin. In African Surinamese, the associations were positive for current smoking, nicotine, and alcohol dependence (odds ratios of 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.27, 1.34; 1.15-1.57 and 1.40; 1.20-1.64, respectively). In Ghanaians, positive association was observed for current drinking (1.21; 1.08-1.36). The associations of PED with smoking and alcohol consumption considerably varied by ethnicity and outcome measure. This suggests that ethnic minority groups in Europe might use different behavioural strategies to cope with PED.",

  "27463423": "Impaired autophagy in macrophages promotes inflammatory eye disease Autophagy is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Organs such as the eye and brain are immunologically privileged. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is essential for maintaining ocular immune privilege. Deletion of multiple autophagy genes in macrophages leads to an inflammation-mediated eye disease called uveitis that can cause blindness. Loss of autophagy activates inflammasome -mediated IL1B secretion that increases disease severity. Inhibition of caspase activity by gene deletion or pharmacological means completely reverses the disease phenotype. Of interest, experimental uveitis was also increased in a model of Crohn disease, a systemic autoimmune disease in which patients often develop uveitis, offering a potential mechanistic link between macrophage autophagy and systemic disease. These findings directly implicate the homeostatic process of autophagy in blinding eye disease and identify novel pathways for therapeutic intervention in uveitis.",

Biostimulation with root exudates, low molecular weight organic acids, of J. acutus did not improve BPA - degradation rates. Furthermore, the endophytic bacterial community of J. acutus was isolated and characterized. Many strains were found to possess increased tolerance to metals such as Zn, Ni, Pb and Cd. Moreover, several endophytic bacterial strains tolerated and even used BPA and/or two antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole) as a sole carbon source. Our results demonstrate that the cultivable bacterial endophytic community of J. acutus is able to use organic contaminants as carbon sources, tolerates metals and is equipped with plant-growth promoting traits. Therefore, J. acutus has potential to be exploited in constructed wetlands when co-contamination is one of the restricting factors.",

L. infantum). A vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) would be an important tool for decreasing the anxiety related to possible L. chagasi infection and for controlling human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Because the sand fly salivary proteins are potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in past decades. We investigated the immunogenicity of the \"LbSapSal\" vaccine (L. braziliensis antigens, saponin as adjuvant, and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland extract) in dogs at baseline (T0), during the post-vaccination protocol (T3rd) and after early (T90) and late (T885) times following L. chagasi - challenge. Our major data indicated that immunization with \" LbSapSal \" is able to induce biomarkers characterized by enhanced amounts of type I (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, interleukin [IL]-12, interferon [IFN]-γ) cytokines and reduction in type II cytokines (IL-4 and TGF-β), even after experimental challenge. The establishment of a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response after \" LbSapSal \" immunization supported the increased levels of nitric oxide production, favoring a reduction in spleen parasitism (78.9%) and indicating long-lasting protection against L. chagasi infection. In conclusion, these results confirmed the hypothesis that the \" LbSapSal \" vaccination is a potential tool to control the Leishmania chagasi infection.",

  "28128333": "ComB proteins expression levels determine Helicobacter pylori competence capacity Helicobacter pylori chronically colonises half of the world's human population and is the main cause of ulcers and gastric cancers. Its prevalence and the increase in antibiotic resistance observed recently reflect the high genetic adaptability of this pathogen. Together with high mutation rates and an efficient DNA recombination system, horizontal gene transfer through natural competence makes of H. pylori one of the most genetically diverse bacteria. We show here that transformation capacity is enhanced in strains defective for recN, extending previous work with other homologous recombination genes. However, inactivation of either mutY or polA has no effect on DNA transformation, suggesting that natural competence can be boosted in H. pylori by the persistence of DNA breaks but not by enhanced mutagenesis. The transformation efficiency of the different DNA repair impaired strains correlates with the number of transforming DNA foci formed on the cell surface and with the expression of comB8 and comB10 competence genes. Overexpression of the comB6-B10 operon is sufficient to increase the transformation capacity of a wild type strain, indicating that the ComB complex, present in the bacterial wall and essential for DNA uptake, can be a limiting factor for transformation efficiency.",

The aim of this study was to determine if physician review of images improves study completeness. A prospective quality improvement (QI) study initiated physician review of first-time echocardiographic studies for completeness before patient discharge. Studies were incomplete if not all anatomic structures were diagnostically demonstrated. QI examinations were compared with controls obtained before study initiation. Demographic and clinical information and duration of scan were collected during the control and QI periods. An anonymous survey was administered to the sonographers to assess perceptions of the intervention. There were no differences between the QI (n = 63) and control (n = 63) groups in age, height, weight, and technical barriers. After study completion, 35% of control scans versus 5% of QI scans were incomplete (P < .001). In the QI group, the sonographer, physician, or both returned to scan in 12 (19%), nine (14%), and two (3%) studies, respectively. QI studies were longer than control studies (44 vs 36 min, P = .003) before review. Physician review added a median of 6 min (range, 1-28 min). The majority of sonographers believed that immediate review improved communication, and 50% believed that it improved their job satisfaction. Review of initial outpatient echocardiographic examinations before patient discharge significantly improves study completeness. Review adds a nominal amount of time to total study duration, improves sonographer - physician communication, and may prevent unnecessary testing, potentially reducing the cost of care.",

Emerging evidence suggests that the high-fructose consumption is a potential and important factor responsible for the rising incidence of IR. The present study investigates the beneficial effects of aqueous extract of Phyllanthus amaru s (PAAE) on IR and oxidative stress in high-fructose (HF) fed male Wistar rats. HF diet (66% of fructose) and PAAE (200 mg/kg body weight/day) were given concurrently to the rats for a period of 60 days. Fructose-fed rats showed weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia, hyperleptinemia, and hypoadiponectinemia (P < 0.05) after 60 days. Co-administration of PAAE along with HF diet significantly ameliorated all these alterations. Regarding hepatic antioxidant status, higher lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, lower reduced glutathione levels and lower activities of enzymatic antioxidants, and the histopathological changes like mild to severe distortion of the normal architecture as well as the prominence and widening of the liver sinusoids observed in the HF diet -fed rats were significantly prevented by PAAE treatment. These findings indicate that PAAE is beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity and attenuating metabolic syndrome and hepatic oxidative stress in fructose-fed rats.",

Hypertension is a risk factor for AD by promoting Aβ deposition. Traditional Chinese medicinal compound tongxinluo (TXL) can improve blood circulation and endothelium -dependent vasodilation. This study investigates the effects of TXL on cognition and Aβ using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). TXL was intragastrically administered to SHRs at low-dose, mid- dose and high-dose for 15, 30 or 60 days. Cognition was evaluated with a Morris Water Maze (MWM). Aβ in the brain was detected by western blot, ELISA and Thioflavin-S staining. Western blot and RT-PCR were employed to exam the expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP). After TXL treatment for 60 days, compared with the vehicle, the number of crossed platform and the time spent in the target quadrant increased in parallel with the increasing length of treatment in MWM. Moreover, the Aβ in the hippocampus significantly decreased compared to the vehicle group, both in western blot and ELISA. Additionally, TXL reduced RAGE expression in a dose - and time -depended manner, but LRP-1 expression had no difference between TXL groups and vehicle groups. Furthermore, the β-secretase expression was significantly decreased compared to the vehicle group, but APP expression had no difference. In conclusion, TXL improved cognition and decreased Aβ in SHRs in a dose - and time -dependent manner, the underlying mechanism may involved in inhibiting RAGE and β-secretase expression.",

Some children present with commensurate language and cognitive abilities, while others show more variable patterns of development. Using spontaneous language samples, we investigate the presence and extent of grammatical language impairment in a heterogeneous sample of children with ASD. Findings from our sample suggest that children with ASD can be categorized into three meaningful subgroups: those with normal language, those with marked difficulty in grammatical production but relatively intact vocabulary, and those with more globally low language abilities. These findings support the use of sensitive assessment measures to evaluate language in autism, as well as the utility of within- disorder comparisons, in order to comprehensively define the various cognitive and linguistic phenotypes in this heterogeneous disorder.",
  "28322190": "Activity patterns of serotonin neurons underlying cognitive flexibility Serotonin is implicated in mood and affective disorders. However, growing evidence suggests that a core endogenous role is to promote flexible adaptation to changes in the causal structure of the environment, through behavioral inhibition and enhanced plasticity. We used long-term photometric recordings in mice to study a population of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons, whose activity we could link to normal reversal learning using pharmacogenetics. We found that these neurons are activated by both positive and negative prediction errors, and thus report signals similar to those proposed to promote learning in conditions of uncertainty. Furthermore, by comparing the cue responses of serotonin and dopamine neurons, we found differences in learning rates that could explain the importance of serotonin in inhibiting perseverative responding. Our findings show how the activity patterns of serotonin neurons support a role in cognitive flexibility, and suggest a revised model of dopamine - serotonin opponency with potential clinical implications.",
  "27617056": "An improved high-quality draft genome sequence of Carnobacterium inhibens subsp. inhibens strain K1(T) Despite their ubiquity and their involvement in food spoilage, the genus Carnobacterium remains rather sparsely characterized at the genome level. Carnobacterium inhibens K1(T) is a member of the Carnobacteriaceae family within the class Bacilli. This strain is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium isolated from the intestine of an Atlantic salmon. The present study determined the genome sequence and annotation of Carnobacterium inhibens K1(T). The genome comprised 2,748,608 bp with a G + C content of 34.85 %, which included 2621 protein-coding genes and 116 RNA genes.

To appreciate an understanding between the dynamics between these structures and how they can be affected by intervention with small molecule ligands, more i-motif binding compounds are required. Herein we describe how the drug mitoxantrone can bind, induce folding of and stabilise i-motif forming DNA sequences, even at physiological pH. Additionally, mitoxantrone was found to bind i-motif forming sequences preferentially over double helical DNA. We also describe the stabilisation properties of analogues of mitoxantrone. This offers a new family of ligands with potential for use in experiments into the structure and function of i-motif forming DNA sequences.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of WL rate on body composition and compensatory mechanisms activated with WL (reduced RMR, increased exercise efficiency (ExEff) and appetite), both during negative and neutral energy balance (EB). Thirty-five participants with obesity were randomized to lose a similar weight rapidly (4 weeks) or gradually (8 weeks), and afterwards to maintain it (4 weeks). Body weight and composition, RMR, ExEff (10, 25 and 50 W), appetite feelings and appetite-regulating hormones (active ghrelin, cholecystokinin, total peptide YY (PYY), active glucagon-like peptide-1 and insulin), in fasting and every 30 min up to 2.5 h, were measured at baseline and after each phase. Changes in body weight (≈9%) and composition were similar in both groups. With WL, RMR decreased and ExEff at 10 W increased significantly in the rapid WL group only. However, fasting hunger increased significantly with gradual WL only, while fasting and postprandial prospective food consumption, and postprandial hunger decreased (and postprandial fullness increased) significantly with rapid WL only. Basal total PYY, and basal and postprandial insulin decreased significantly, and similarly in both groups. After weight stabilization and no ketosis no differences between groups were found. Despite differences while under negative EB, WL rate does not seem to have a significant impact on body composition or on compensatory mechanisms, once EB is reestablished.

The condition is likely to occur in cases of violent trauma, seizures, or electric shock. Unrecognized dislocation with humeral head fracture affects joint function and humeral head vascularity and may lead to chronic instability, osteonecrosis, and osteoarthritis. A group of 12 patients, including 10 men and 2 women, with neglected locked posterior shoulder dislocation with a reverse Hill-Sachs lesion were treated with the modified McLaughlin technique. The added bone graft from the iliac crest was impacted in the defect and fixed with screws. Mean follow-up was 30 months (range, 24-48 months). The range of forward flexion was 150˚ to 175˚ (average, 165˚), external rotation ranged from 60˚ to 80˚ (average, 75˚), internal rotation ranged from 40˚ to 60˚ (average, 50˚), and average abduction was 150˚ (range, 145˚-160˚). The modified University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) scoring system was used for postoperative clinical evaluation. Total UCLA scores immediately postoperatively ranged from 22 to 28 points (average, 26.5 points) and averaged 30 points (range, 28-33 points) at last follow-up. No recurrence of dislocation occurred during the follow-up period. Of the study patients, 10 returned to their previous job and 2 modified their manual work. The modified McLaughlin technique with added iliac crest bone graft to fill the defect and prevent humeral head deformity is a successful technique for the treatment of patients with chronic locked posterior shoulder dislocation.

We investigated the presence and localization of proform and active caspase 3 by enzyme assay, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. In parallel, a fragment of caspase 3 was cloned for the first time in this species, sequenced and used for in situ hybridization to localize messengers and analysed by a phylogenetic survey to shed light on its homology with reptilian caspases. Results demonstrated that: (1) the follicle cells expressed a caspase of the 3/7 group and the mRNA for caspase 3 was transcribed in the stem phase and was completely translated during cell differentiation; (2) the proform protein was stored during the differentiated (nurse) stage and activated at the end of previtellogenesis provoking the degeneration of cells; (3) the predicted protein sequence, although partial, had a strong similarity with the known reptilian caspases 3. The epithelial cells of the ovarian follicle, therefore, do not employ caspase 3 during the nurse stage but, instead, prepare for apoptosis long before the process actually begins. The relevance of this strategy is discussed.",

Based on promising results from a previous quality control study, this prospective multicenter randomized controlled phase III clinical trial aims to elucidate the oncologic safety of laparoscopic stomach-preserving surgery with sentinel basin dissection (SBD) compared to a standard laparoscopic gastrectomy. This trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter randomized controlled phase III trial with a non-inferiority design. Patients diagnosed with a single lesion of clinical stage T1N0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma, with a diameter of 3 cm or less are eligible for the present study. A total of 580 patients (290 per group) will be randomized to either laparoscopic stomach-preserving surgery with SBD or standard surgery. The primary end-point is 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and the secondary endpoints include postoperative morbidity and mortality, quality of life, 5-year DFS, and overall survival. Qualified investigators who completed the prior quality control study are exclusively allowed to participate in this phase III clinical trial. The proposed trial is expected to verify whether laparoscopic stomach-preserving surgery with SBD achieves similar oncologic outcomes and improved quality of life compared to a standard gastrectomy in EGC patients.

This can include changes to the amount of support they provide their child and changes to the degree to which they control and monitor their child. We conducted an in-depth qualitative study with 37 parents of young people who had self-harmed in which we explored how and why their parenting changed after the discovery of self-harm. Early on, parents often found themselves \"walking on eggshells\" so as not to upset their child, but later they felt more able to take some control. Parents ' reactions to the self-harm often depended on how they conceptualised it: as part of adolescence, as a mental health issue or as \" naughty behaviour \". Parenting of other children in the family could also be affected, with parents worrying about less of their time being available for siblings. Many parents developed specific strategies they felt helped them to be more effective parents, such as learning to avoid blaming themselves or their child for the self-harm and developing new ways to communicate with their child. Parents were generally eager to pass their knowledge on to other people in the same situation. Parents reported changes in their parenting behaviours after the discovery of a child 's self-harm. Professionals involved in the care of young people who self-harm might use this information in supporting and advising parents.",

However, this beneficial recycling is hampered by unclear metal / metalloid pollution risks related to DWTR. In this study, the pollution risks of Al, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, and Zn due to DWTR application were first evaluated for lake water based on human health risk assessment models and comparison of regulatory standards. The risks of DWTR were also evaluated for sediments on the basis of toxicity characteristics leaching procedure and fractionation in relation to risk assessment code. Variations in the biological behaviors of metal / metalloid in sediments caused by DWTR were assessed using Chironomus plumosus larvae and Hydrilla verticillata. Kinetic luminescent bacteria test (using Aliivibrio fischeri) was conducted to analyze the possibility of acute and chronic detrimental effects of sediment with DWTR application. According to the obtained results, we identify a potential undesirable effect of DWTR related to Fe and Mn (typically under anaerobic conditions); roughly present a dosage threshold calculation model; and recommend a procedure for DWTR prescreening to ensure safe application. Overall, managed DWTR application is necessary for successful eutrophication control.",

In addition to methamphetamine (METH), these drugs include 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and commercial preparations of synthetic cathinones including 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), typically referred to as \" bath salts .\" These psychostimulants exert neurotoxic effects by altering monoamine systems in the brain. Additionally, METH and MDMA adversely affect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB): there are no current reports on the effects of MDPV on the BBB. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of METH, MDMA and MDPV on bovine brain microvessel endothelial cells (bBMVECs), an accepted in vitro model of the BBB. Confluent bBMVEC monolayers were treated with METH, MDMA and MDPV (0.5mM-2.5mM) for 24h. METH and MDMA increased lactate dehydrogenase release only at the highest concentration (2.5mM), whereas MDPV induced cytotoxicity at all concentration s. MDMA and METH decreased cellular proliferation only at 2.5mM, with similar effects observed after MDPV exposures starting at 1mM. Only MDPV increased reactive oxygen species production at all concentrations tested whereas all 3 drugs increased nitric oxide production. Morphological analysis revealed different patterns of compound - induced cell damage. METH induced vacuole formatio n at 1mM and disruption of the monolayer at 2.5mM. MDMA induced disruption of the endothelial monolayer from 1mM without vacuolization. On the other hand, MDPV induced monolayer disruption at doses ≥0.5mM without vacuole formation; at 2.5mM, the few remaining cells lacked endothelial morphology. These data suggest that even though these synthetic psychostimulants alter monoaminergic systems, they each induce BBB toxicity by different mechanisms with MDPV being the most toxic.",

We thus aim to accurately evaluate their muscle functions, and identify the best training strategy to achieve optimal muscle strength balance in future training programs. The participants in this study consisted of 14 male volleyball players. Muscle strength was measured using the isokinetic dynamometer. Muscle strength was evaluated in terms of peak torque and average power, calculated from five repeated measurements at an angular speed of 60°/sec. Three players who were left attackers showed shoulder imbalance, four players showed trunk joint imbalance, nine players had knee joint of extension/flexion imbalance and four players showed left/right imbalance. The results showed that the number of volleyball players with differences between the strength of the bilateral knee muscles, and between the strength of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles was higher than the number of players with differences between the strength of the shoulder internal and external rotation muscles, and higher than the number of players with differences between the strength of the lower back extension and flexion muscles.",

We aimed to analyse the interplay between this plasmid -mediated gene and chromosomal -mediated quinolone resistance mechanisms on both FQ resistance and bacterial fitness in Escherichia coli. E. coli ATCC 25922 and derived isogenic strains carrying chromosomal -mediated quinolone resistance modifications (Ser83Leu-Asp87Asn in GyrA, Ser80Arg in ParC and/or a marR gene deletion) were electroporated with a pBK-CMV vector encoding AAC(6')-Ib-cr. The MICs of FQs were determined by microdilution and bactericidal activity was determined using time-kill curves. A peritoneal sepsis murine model was used to evaluate the in vivo impact. Bacterial fitness was analysed using growth curves and competition assays. The presence of the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene increased the MICs of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin 4-8-fold for all E. coli genotypes, independently of the initial resistance level. Combination of the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene with three or four chromosomal mechanisms was necessary to reach MIC values above the susceptible category. Killing curve assays showed a clear selective advantage for survival in strains harbouring the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene (up to 7 log10 cfu/mL after 24 h). AAC(6')-Ib-cr significantly reduced the ciprofloxacin efficacy in vivo. In terms of bacterial fitness cost, maximal OD was significantly lower for all strains harbouring the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene, independently of chromosomal mutations associated. The aac(6')-Ib-cr gene, in spite of producing low-level resistance by itself, plays a relevant role in acquisition of a clinical level of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin resistance, when combined with three or four chromosomal mutations, both in vitro and in vivo.",

We classified asthma patients by airway inflammation phenotype using the induced sputum eosinophil and neutrophil ratio and determined whether this phenotype could be predicted using E/I LF and fractional exhaled nitric oxide values. Steroid-naive bronchial asthma patients were classified into four phenotypes, including \" Low inflammation \" (35 patients), \" Eosinophilic type \" (58 patients), \" Neutrophilic type \" (15 patients), and \" Mixed type \" (15 patients) based on the results of induced sputum examinations. The E/I LF data and FeNO levels were then evaluated for the four phenotype groups; the prediction powers of these two indices were then analyzed for each phenotype. The median E/I LF value was highest in the \" Mixed type \" and lowest in the \" Low inflammation \" group. FeNO differentiated between the \" Low inflammation \" and \" Eosinophilic type \" groups, \" Low inflammation \" and \" Neutrophilic type \" groups, and \" Neutrophilic type \" and \" Mixed type \" (p < 0.0001, p = 0.007, and p = 0.04, respectively). E/I LF differentiated between the \" Low inflammation \" and \" Eosinophilic type \" groups (p = 0.006). E/I LF could distinguish the \" Mixed type \" group from the \" Low inflammation \" and \" Eosinophilic type \" groups (p = 0.002). A combination of the E/I LF value and FeNO may be useful for the classification of the airway inflammation phenotype in patients with bronchial asthma.",

A home-made acrylic phantom able to support a film (EBT3) in its coronal plane was used. The phantom was CT scanned and three coplanar small targets (a central and two peripheral) were outlined in the Eclipse system. Peripheral targets were 6 cm apart from the central one. A reference IMRS plan was designed to simultaneously treat the three targets, but only a single isocenter located at the center of the central target was used. After positioning the phantom on the linac using the room lasers, a CBCT scan was acquired and the reference plan were mapped on it, by placing the planned isocenter at the intersection of the landmarks used in the film showing the linac isocenter. The mapped plan was then recalculated and delivered. The film dose distribution was derived using a cloud computing application (www.radiochromic.com) that uses a triple-channel dosimetry algorithm. Comparison of dose distributions using the gamma index (5%/1 mm) were performed over a 5 × 5 cm(2) region centered over each target. 2D shifts required to get the best gamma passing rates on the peripheral target regions were compared with the reported ones for the central target. The experiment was repeated ten times in different sessions. Average 2D shifts required to achieve optimal gamma passing rates (99%, 97%, 99%) were 0.7 mm (SD: 0.3 mm), 0.8 mm (SD: 0.4 mm) and 0.8 mm (SD: 0.3 mm), for the central and the two peripheral targets, respectively. No statistical differences (p > 0.05) were found for targeting accuracy between the central and the two peripheral targets.

Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is responsible for the non-shivering thermogenesis in the BAT. Pig is important economically as a meat -producing livestock. However, whether BAT or more precisely UCP1 protein exists in pig remains a controversy. The objective of this study was to ascertain whether pig has UCP1 protein. In this study, we used rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique to obtain the UCP1 mRNA 3' end sequence, confirmed only exons 1 and 2 of the UCP1 gene are transcribed in the pig. Then we cloned the pig UCP1 gene exons 1 and 2, and expressed the UCP1 protein from the truncated pig gene using E. coli BL21. We used the expressed pig UCP1 protein as antigen for antibody production in a rabbit. We could not detect any UCP1 protein expression in different pig adipose tissues by the specific pig UCP1 antibody, while our antibody can detect the cloned pig UCP1 as well as the mice adipose UCP1 protein. This result shows although exons 1 and 2 of the pig UCP1 gene were transcribed but not translated in the pig adipose tissue. Furthermore, we detected no uncoupled respiration in the isolated pig adipocytes. Thus, these results unequivocally demonstrate that pig has no UCP1 protein. Our results have resolved the controversy of whether pigs have the brown adipose tissue.",

Thus women with PCOS may be at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Present study aims to evaluate Vitamin D status and to assess its association with metabolic and endocrinal dysregulations in women with PCOS, which might help in early identification and prevention of future symptomatic cardiac disease. A total of 44 women with PCOS, diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria and 45 healthy control without PCOS, were evaluated for Vitamin D and cardiometabolic risk factors, including fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hs-CRP. That apart, several endocrinal parameters of hyperandrogenism were also examined. Several correlation studies were determined to establish the role of Vitamin D as a cardiometabolic risk factor in PCOS. Results were expressed as mean±SD and were statistically analysed using SPSS software version 16, unpaired student's t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. We found lower levels of Vitamin D, which was statistically significant as compared to healthy controls. Hyperinsulinemia, rise in insulin resistance and marked dyslipidemia was observed in the present study. Another relevant finding was significant correlation of Vitamin D with insulin and Homeostatic Model of Assessment- Insulin Resistance Index (HOMA-IR). Hypovitaminosis D was prevalent in PCOS. This was related to metabolic and hormonal disorders in PCOS. Possibly this combined with impaired fasting glucose, IR and dyslipidemia, could account for Cardio vascular risks in PCOS.

The first layer of this system is a syndromic surveillance screen to guide rapid polymerase chain reaction testing. The second layer is geolocalization and cluster analysis of these patients. We posit that any identified clusters could represent at-risk populations who could serve as high-yield targets for preventive medical interventions. This was a prospective observational surveillance study. Patients were screened with a previously derived clinical decision guideline that has a 90% sensitivity and 30% specificity for influenza. Patients received points for the following signs and symptoms within the past 7 days: cough (2 points), headache (1 point), subjective fever (1 point), and documented fever at triage (temperature >38°C [100.4°F]) (1 point). Patients scoring 3 points or higher were indicated for influenza testing. Patients were tested with Xpert Flu (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), a rapid polymerase chain reaction test. Positive results were mapped with ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA) and analyzed with kernel density estimation to create heat maps. There were 1,360 patients tested with Xpert Flu with retrievable addresses within the greater Phoenix metro area. One hundred sixty-seven (12%) of them tested positive for influenza A and 23 (2%) tested positive for influenza B. The influenza A virus exhibited a clear cluster pattern within this patient population. The densest cluster was located in an approximately 1- square-mile region southeast of our hospital. Our layered-surveillance approach was effective in localizing a cluster of influenza A outbreak. This region may house a high-yield target population for public health intervention. Further collaborative efforts will be made between our hospital and the Maricopa County Department of Public Health to perform a series of community vaccination events before the next influenza season. We hope these efforts will ultimately serve to reduce the burden of this disease on our patient population, and that this system will serve as a framework for future investigations locating at-risk populations.",

The study aimed to determine and describe the spectrum of thyroid disorders seen at Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital over a 10- year period. This was a retrospective analysis of records of patients who presented to the hospital with thyroid swellings over a 10- year period (June 2004 to June 2014). Clinicopathological and demographic data obtained from hospital records in 175 patients diagnosed by clinical examination, thyroid ultrasound, hormone profile and histological confirmation in cases that had surgery were analysed for this study. The records of 175 patients were obtained comprising 151 (86.3%) females and 24 (13.7%) males (female to male ratio of 6.3:1) with age range from 18 to 76 years and mean age of 42.3 years, standard deviation 13.5.

Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor, is considered to be a critical modulator of inflammatory responses and cellular redox homeostasis. Monocytes play an important role in the invasion and immunity to resist pathogens. Here, we investigated the role of Nrf2 in the anti-inflammatory response stimulated by LAMPs using the human monocyte cell line THP-1. LAMPs were shown to affect the localization of Nrf2, and the levels of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory reactants, including nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8), were highly elevated in LAMP -stimulated Nrf2 -silenced THP-1 cells. Moreover, LAMPs induced the levels of mRNA and the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). In summary, our results demonstrated that LAMPs cause nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which further suppresses the expression of inflammatory reactants in THP-1 cells.",

Gastrodin (GAS), the main constituent of a Chinese traditional herbal medicine named Gastrodia elata Blume, has been reported to be associated with neuroprotective properties. Besides, GAS activated MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways which are often involved in growth of nerve cells were also reported. Based on the hypothesis that GAS may have an effect on SCs growth, we studied the effect of GAS on rat RSC96 Schwann cells (SCs) and further explored the underlying mechanism. Various concentration of GAS (0μM, 50μM, 100μM, and 200μM) was used for treatment of RSC96 SCs, with the cell proliferation and gene expression of several neurotrophic factors to be detected. Regulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways were assayed by detecting phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and Akt. The results showed that GAS could effectively promote proliferation of RSC96 SCs in a dose - and time -dependent manner. The best performance was obtained at the concentration of 200μM. Exploration of the underlying mechanism showed that GAS probably affects SCs metabolism through inhibiting ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation and activating Akt phosphorylation in RSC96 SCs. This study may provide reference for its application in treatment of peripheral nerve injuries.",

Several devices designed to limit supine position have been developed, but evidences of their efficacy and safety are lacking. It is unclear whether a neck-worn vibrating device could induce positional change in patients with positional OSAS. We evaluated the efficacy of a neck -worn device to induce supine avoidance positional feedback over a short-term trial in OSAS patients and its impact on sleep quality and polysomnographyc indexes. Twenty patients with positional apneas / hypopneas were prospectively studied. Baseline characteristics of daytime somnolence and risk of sleep apnea were screened and the efficacy of a 3-day trial of supine - avoidance therapy by vibrotactile neck worn device assessed by reporting the self-perceived change in quality of sleep and performing cardio-respiratory polysomnography. Comparison between baseline and treatment results was performed. The neck device produced a reduction in overall apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (mean AHI pre =16.8/h and post =4.4/h, P<0.0001), oxygen desaturation (pre =13.7/h and post =3.8/h, P<0.0001) and Respiratory Disturbance Indexes (RDI) (20.0/h vs. 5.2/h; P<0.0001).The time spent in supine position decreased from 62.1% to 33.7% of the total (P<0.001). However, the impact on the perceived quality of sleep was unpredictable. The neck position therapy device is effective in restricting supine sleep, improving AHI and related polysomnographic indexes. However, at least in a short-term trial, it seems unable to improve the patient's sleep quality.",
  "27993971": "The CD9, CD81, and CD151 EC2 domains bind to the classical RGD-binding site of integrin αvβ3 Tetraspanins play important roles in normal (e.g., cell adhesion, motility, activation, and proliferation), and pathological conditions (e.g., metastasis and viral infection). Tetraspanins interact with integrins and regulate integrin functions, but the specifics of tetraspanin - integrin interaction are unclear. Using co-immunoprecipitation with integrins as a sole method to detect interaction between integrins and full-length tetraspanins, it has been proposed that the variable region (helices D and E) of the extracellular-2 (EC2) of tetraspanins laterally associate with non-ligand-binding site of integrins. We describe that, using adhesion assays, the EC2 domain of CD81, CD9, and CD151 bound to integrin αvβ3 and this binding was suppressed by cRGDfV, a specific inhibitor of αvβ3, and antibody 7E3 that is mapped to the ligand-binding site of β3. We also present evidence that the specificity loop of β3 directly bound to the EC2 domains. This suggests that the EC2 domains specifically binds to the classical ligand-binding site of αvβ3. αvβ3 was a more effective receptor for the EC2 domains than previously known tetraspanin receptors α3β1, α4β1, and α6β1. Docking simulation predicted that the helices A and B of CD81 EC2 binds to the RGD-binding site of αvβ3. Substituting Lys residues at position 116, 144/148 of CD81 EC2 in the predicted integrin - binding interface reduced the binding of CD81 EC2 to αvβ3, consistent with the docking model. These findings suggest that, in contrast to previous models, the ligand-binding site of integrin αvβ3, a new tetraspanin receptor, binds to the constant region (helices A and B) of the EC2 domain.",
  "28507142": "Quantitative assessment of passive electrical properties of the cardiac T-tubular system by FRAP microscopy Well-coordinated activation of all cardiomyocytes must occur on every heartbeat. At the cell level, a complex network of sarcolemmal invaginations, called the transverse-axial tubular system (TATS), propagates membrane potential changes to the cell core, ensuring synchronous and uniform excitation-contraction coupling. Although myocardial conduction of excitation has been widely described, the electrical properties of the TATS remain mostly unknown. Here, we exploit the formal analogy between diffusion and electrical conductivity to link the latter with the diffusional properties of TATS. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy is used to probe the diffusion properties of TATS in isolated rat cardiomyocytes: A fluorescent dextran inside TATS lumen is photobleached, and signal recovery by diffusion of unbleached dextran from the extracellular space is monitored. We designed a mathematical model to correlate the time constant of fluorescence recovery with the apparent diffusion coefficient of the fluorescent molecules. Then, apparent diffusion is linked to electrical conductivity and used to evaluate the efficiency of the passive spread of membrane depolarization along TATS. The method is first validated in cells where most TATS elements are acutely detached by osmotic shock and then applied to probe TATS electrical conductivity in failing heart cells. We find that acute and pathological tubular remodeling significantly affect TATS electrical conductivity. This may explain the occurrence of defects in action potential propagation at the level of single T-tubules, recently observed in diseased cardiomyocytes.",
  "27964731": "Use of single molecule sequencing for comparative genomics of an environmental and a clinical isolate of Clostridium difficile ribotype 078 How the pathogen Clostridium difficile might survive, evolve and be transferred between reservoirs within the natural environment is poorly understood. Some ribotypes are found both in clinical and environmental settings. Whether these strains are distinct from each another and evolve in the specific environments is not established. The possession of a highly mobile genome has contributed to the genetic diversity and ongoing evolution of C. difficile. Interpretations of genetic diversity have been limited by fragmented assemblies resulting from short-read length sequencing approaches and by a limited understanding of epigenetic regulation of diversity. To address this, single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing was used in this study as it produces high quality genome sequences, with resolution of repeat regions (including those found in mobile elements) and can generate data to determine methylation modifications across the sequence (the methylome). Chromosomal rearrangements and ribosomal operon duplications were observed in both genomes. The rearrangements occurred at insertion sites within two mobile genetic elements (MGEs), Tn6164 and Tn6293, present only in the M120 and CD105HS27 genomes, respectively. The gene content of these two transposons differ considerably which could impact upon horizontal gene transfer; differences include CDSs encoding methylases and a conjugative prophage only in Tn6164. To investigate mechanisms which could affect MGE transfer, the methylome, restriction modification (RM) and the CRISPR/Cas systems were characterised for each strain. Notably, the environmental isolate, CD105HS27, does not share a consensus motif for (m4)C methylation, but has one additional spacer when compared to the clinical isolate M120. These findings show key differences between the two strains in terms of their genetic capacity for MGE transfer. The carriage of horizontally transferred genes appear to have genome wide effects based on two different methylation patterns. The CRISPR/Cas system appears active although perhaps slow to evolve. Data suggests that both mechanisms are functional and impact upon horizontal gene transfer and genome evolution within C. difficile.",
  "27689386": "Copolymer Brush -Based Ultralow-Fouling Biorecognition Surface Platform for Food Safety Functional polymer coatings that combine the ability to resist nonspecific fouling from complex media with high biorecognition element (BRE) immobilization capacity represent an emerging class of new functional materials for a number of bioanalytical and biosensor technologies for medical diagnostics, security, and food safety. Here, we report on a random copolymer brush surface - poly(CBMAA-ran-HPMAA) - providing high BRE immobilization capacity while simultaneously exhibiting ultralow-fouling behavior in complex food media. We demonstrate that both the functionalization and fouling resistance capabilities of such copolymer brushes can be tuned by changing the surface contents of the two monomer units: nonionic N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMAA) and carboxy-functional zwitterionic carboxybetaine methacrylamide (CBMAA). It is demonstrated that the resistance to fouling decreases with the surface content of CBMAA; poly(CBMAA-ran-HPMAA) brushes with CBMAA molar content up to 15 mol % maintain excellent resistance to fouling from a variety of homogenized foods (hamburger, cucumber, milk, and lettuce) even after covalent attachment of BREs to carboxy groups of CBMAA. The poly(CBMAA 15 mol %-ran-HPMAA) brushes functionalized with antibodies are demonstrated to exhibit fouling resistance from food samples by up to 3 orders of magnitude better when compared with the widely used low-fouling carboxy-functional oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG)-based alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayers (AT SAMs) and, furthermore, by up to 2 orders of magnitude better when compared with the most successful ultralow-fouling biorecognition coatings - poly(carboxybetaine acrylamide), poly(CBAA). When model SPR detections of food-borne bacterial pathogens in homogenized foods are used, it is also demonstrated that the antibody - functionalized poly(CBMAA 15 mol %-ran-HPMAA) brush exhibits superior biorecognition properties over the poly(CBAA).",

  "27485594": "Systematic Quantification of GPCR / cAMP - Controlled Protein Kinase A Interactions The diffusible second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) originates from multiple G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) cascades activating the intracellular key effector protein kinase A (PKA). Spatially and temporally restricted cAMP - fluxes are directly sensed by macromolecular PKA complexes. The consequences are alterations of molecular interactions, which lead to activation of compartmentalized PKA phosphotransferase activities, regulating a vast array of cellular functions. To decode cell-type and cell-compartment specific PKA functions, the spatio-temporal dynamics of small molecule:protein interactions, protein:protein interactions (PPIs), cAMP - mobilization, and phosphotransferase activities need to be determined directly in the appropriate cellular context. A collection of cell-based reporters has been developed to either visualize or quantitatively measure kinase activities or PKA complex formation / dissociation. In this review, we list a collection of unimolecular and bimolecular PKA biosensors, followed by the specification of the modular design of a Renilla luciferase based protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) platform for measuring PKA network interactions. We discuss the application spectrum of the PCA reporter to identify, quantify, and dissect dynamic and transient PKA complexes downstream of specific GPCR activities. We specify the implementation of a PCA PKA platform to systematically quantify the concurrent involvement of receptor - cAMP signaling, post-translational modifications, and kinase subunit mutations / perturbations in PKA activation. The systematic quantification of transient PKA network interactions will contribute to a better understanding how GPCR -recognized input signals are streamlined through the compartmentalized and cAMP - interacting PKA signalosome.",
  "27436524": "Effects of complex life cycles on genetic diversity: cyclical parthenogenesis Neutral patterns of population genetic diversity in species with complex life cycles are difficult to anticipate. Cyclical parthenogenesis (CP), in which organisms undergo several rounds of clonal reproduction followed by a sexual event, is one such life cycle. Many species, including crop pests (aphids), human parasites (trematodes) or models used in evolutionary science (Daphnia), are cyclical parthenogens. It is therefore crucial to understand the impact of such a life cycle on neutral genetic diversity. In this paper, we describe distributions of genetic diversity under conditions of CP with various clonal phase lengths. Using a Markov chain model of CP for a single locus and individual-based simulations for two loci, our analysis first demonstrates that strong departures from full sexuality are observed after only a few generations of clonality. The convergence towards predictions made under conditions of full clonality during the clonal phase depends on the balance between mutations and genetic drift. Second, the sexual event of CP usually resets the genetic diversity at a single locus towards predictions made under full sexuality. However, this single recombination event is insufficient to reshuffle gametic phases towards full-sexuality predictions. Finally, for similar levels of clonality, CP and acyclic partial clonality (wherein a fixed proportion of individuals are clonally produced within each generation) differentially affect the distribution of genetic diversity. Overall, this work provides solid predictions of neutral genetic diversity that may serve as a null model in detecting the action of common evolutionary or demographic processes in cyclical parthenogens (for example, selection or bottlenecks).",
  "27266322": "The biological effect of metal ions on the granulation of aerobic granular activated sludge As a special biofilm structure, microbial attachment is believed to play an important role in the granulation of aerobic granular activated sludge (AGAS). This experiment was to investigate the biological effect of Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Cu(2+), Fe(2+), Zn(2+), and K(+) which are the most common ions present in biological wastewater treatment systems, on the microbial attachment of AGAS and flocculent activated sludge (FAS), from which AGAS is always derived, in order to provide a new strategy for the rapid cultivation and stability control of AGAS. The result showed that attachment biomass of AGAS was about 300% higher than that of FAS without the addition of metal ions. Different metal ions had different effects on the process of microbial attachment. FAS and AGAS reacted differently to the metal ions as well, and in fact, AGAS was more sensitive to the metal ions. Specifically, Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and K(+) could increase the microbial attachment ability of both AGAS and FAS under appropriate concentrations, Cu(2+), Fe(2+), and Zn(2+) were also beneficial to the microbial attachment of FAS at low concentrations, but Cu(2+), Fe(2+), and Zn(2+) greatly inhibited the attachment process of AGAS even at extremely low concentrations. In addition, the acylated homoserine lactone (AHL)-based quorum sensing system, the content of extracellular polymeric substances and the relative hydrophobicity of the sludges were greatly influenced by metal ions. As all these parameters had close relationships with the microbial attachment process, the microbial attachment may be affected by changes of these parameters.",

This study proposes international definitions for neonatal infections. The neonatal infections GAIA working group performed a literature review using Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane collaboration and collected definitions in use in neonatal and public health networks. The common criteria derived from the extensive search formed the basis for a consensus process that resulted in three separate definitions for neonatal blood stream infections (BSI), meningitis and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI).

In recently diverged populations, genealogical discordance may reveal genes and genomic regions that contribute to the speciation process. Previous work has shown that conspecific colonies of Acropora that spawn in different seasons (spring and autumn) are associated with highly diverged lineages of the phylogenetic marker PaxC Here, we used 10 034 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to generate a genome -wide phylogeny and compared it with gene genealogies from the PaxC intron and the mtDNA Control Region in 20 species of Acropora, including three species with spring - and autumn - spawning cohorts. The PaxC phylogeny separated conspecific autumn and spring spawners into different genetic clusters in all three species; however, this pattern was not supported in two of the three species at the genome level, suggesting a selective connection between PaxC and reproductive timing in Acropora corals. This genome -wide phylogeny provides an improved foundation for resolving phylogenetic relationships in Acropora and, combined with PaxC, provides a fascinating platform for future research into regions of the genome that influence reproductive isolation and speciation in corals.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of Spirulina fusiformis on Diclofenac - induced toxicity in Wistar albino rats. Rats were treated as follows: normal control (group I); diclofenac (50mg/kgb.w., i.p.) treated rats (group II); diclofenac - induced (50mg/kgb.w., i.p.) rats treated with Spirulina fusiformis (400mg/kgb.w., p.o.)

Biochemical (liver and kidney functional markers) and antioxidant parameters (enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants) were measured in the blood and tissue homogenates of the rats. Evaluation of intestinal ulcer score and assessment of liver and kidney histology were also done. Alterations in the levels of biochemical and antioxidant assays and histopathological changes in liver and kidney proved the toxic effect of diclofenac. The ulcer score was significantly increased in the diclofenac treated rats. Spirulina fusiformis showed to reduce such changes and was able to restore normal antioxidant status in the rats. Our study proves the hepato-renal and gastroprotective activity of Spirulina fusiformis in diclofenac - treated rats.",
  "27695327": "Fabrication of gelatin methacrylate / nanohydroxyapatite microgel arrays for periodontal tissue regeneration Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease and is the major cause of tooth loss and other oral health issues around the world. Periodontal tissue regeneration has therefore always been the ultimate goal of dentists and researchers. Existing fabrication methods mainly focused on a top-down tissue engineering strategy in which several drawbacks remain, including low throughput and limited diffusion properties resulting from a large sample size. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) is a kind of photocrosslinkable and biocompatible hydrogel, with the capacities of enabling cell encapsulation and regeneration of functional tissues. Here, we developed a novel method to fabricate GelMA / nanohydroxylapatite (nHA) microgel arrays using a photocrosslinkable strategy. The viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation and in vivo osteogenesis of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) encapsulated in microgels were evaluated. The results suggested that such microgels provide great potential for periodontal tissue repair and regeneration. Microgel arrays were fabricated by blending different weight ratios of GelMA and nHA. hPDLSCs were encapsulated in GelMA / nHA microgels of various ratios for a systematic evaluation of cell viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo osteogenesis in nude mice was also studied. The GelMA / nHA microgels exhibited appropriate microarchitecture, mechanical strength, and surface roughness, thus enabling cell adhesion and proliferation. Additionally, the GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs by elevating the expression levels of osteogenic biomarker genes, such as ALP, BSP, OCN, and RUNX2. In vivo ectopic transplantation results showed that GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) increased mineralized tissue formation with abundant vascularization, compared with the 1%, 3%, and the pure GelMA group. The GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) facilitated hPDLSCs viability, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro and further promoted new bone formation in vivo, suggesting that the GelMA / nHA microgels (10%/2% w/v) provide great potential for periodontal tissue regeneration.",

We randomized four primary care sites to training or wait-list conditions; PCPs at wait-list sites were trained after reassessment. Primary care providers (PCPs) were Family Medicine residents (n = 17; 2 sites) or community physicians (n = 13; 2 sites). Outcomes reported here comprised a survey of 400 actual patients seen by the PCPs in the study. Patients, mostly minority, completed surveys before or after their provider received training. Patients rated PCPs significantly higher after training on a scale encompassing partnership issues. Breakdowns showed lower partnership scores for those with trauma or posttraumatic stress symptoms. Future studies will need to include more specific trauma-related outcomes. Nevertheless, this training is a promising initial approach to teaching trauma-informed communication skills to PCPs.",

We developed an electrophysiology -based classification of dentate granule cells and mossy cells in mice that we validated by optogenetic tagging of mossy cells. Granule cells exhibited sparse firing, had a single place field, and showed only modest changes when the mouse was tested in different mazes in the same room. In contrast, mossy cells were more active, had multiple place fields and showed stronger remapping of place fields under the same conditions. Although the granule cell - mossy cell synapse was strong and facilitating, mossy cells rarely \"inherited\" place fields from single granule cells. Our findings suggest that the granule cells and mossy cells could be modulated separately and their joint action may be critical for pattern separation.",

The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has emerged as a novel tool for prevention of sudden cardiac death, but clinical performance data for adults with congenital heart disease are limited. A retrospective study involving 7 centers over a 5- year period beginning in 2011 was performed. Twenty-one patients (median 33.9 years) were identified. The most common diagnosis was single ventricle physiology (52%), 9 palliated by Fontan operation and 2 by aortopulmonary shunts: d-transposition of the great arteries after Mustard / Senning (n=2), tetralogy of Fallot (n=2), aortic valve disease (n=2), and other biventricular surgery (n=4). A prior cardiac device had been implanted in 7 (33%). The ICD indication was primary prevention in 67% and secondary in 33% patient s. The most common reason for subcutaneous ICD placement was limited transvenous access for ventricular lead placement (n=10) followed by intracardiac right-to-left shunt (n=5). Ventricular arrhythmia was induced in 17 (81%) and was converted with ≤80 Joules in all. There was one implant complication related to infection, not requiring device removal. Over a median follow-up of 14 months, 4 patients (21%) received inappropriate and 1 (5%) patient received appropriate shocks. There was one arrhythmic death related to asystole in a single ventricle patient. Subcutaneous ICD implantation is feasible for adults with congenital heart disease patients. Most candidates have single ventricle heart disease and limited transvenous options for ICD placement. Despite variable anatomy, this study demonstrates successful conversion of induced ventricular arrhythmia and reasonable rhythm discrimination during follow-up.",

The present study evaluates calibration models designed to estimate PA and SB in a representative sample of adults from the Physical Activity Measurement Survey (PAMS). Participants in the PAMS project completed replicate single day trials that involved wearing a Sensewear armband (SWA) monitor for 24 hours followed by a telephone administered 24-hour physical activity recall (PAR). Comprehensive statistical model selection and validation procedures were used to develop and test separate calibration models designed to predict objectively - measured SB and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA from self-reported PAR data. Equivalence testing was used to evaluate the equivalence of the model- predicted values with the objective measures in a separate holdout sample. The final prediction model for both SB and MVPA included reported time spent in SB and MVPA, as well as terms capturing sex, age, education, and BMI. Cross-validation analyses on an independent sample exhibited high correlations with observed SB (r = 0.72) and MVPA (r = 0.75). Equivalence testing demonstrated that the model- predicted values were statistically equivalent to the corresponding objective values for both SB and MVPA. The results demonstrate that simple regression models can be used to statistically adjust for over or underestimation in self-report measures among different segments of the population. The models produced group estimates from the PAR that were statistically equivalent to the observed time spent in SB and MVPA obtained from the objective SWA monitor; however additional work is needed to correct for estimates of individual behavior.",

Fish ectoparasites make initial contact with their hosts at body surfaces, such as skin and gills, which are covered with mucosa that are similar to those of mammalian guts. Fish are among the most primitive vertebrates with immune systems that are equivalent to those in mammals, and they produce and secrete IgM into mucus. In this study, we showed that the monogenean parasite Heterobothrium okamotoi utilizes IgM to recognize its host, fugu Takifugu rubripes Oncomiracidia are infective larvae of H. okamotoi that shed their cilia and metamorphose into juveniles when exposed to purified d-mannose - binding fractions from fugu mucus. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, proteins contained in the fraction were identified as d-mannose -specific IgM with two d-mannose -binding lectins. However, although deciliation was significantly induced by IgM and was inhibited by d-mannose or a specific Ab against fugu IgM, other lectins had no effect, and IgM without d-mannose affinity induced deciliation to a limited degree. Subsequent immunofluorescent staining experiments showed that fugu d-mannose -specific IgM binds ciliated epidermal cells of oncomiracidium. These observations suggest that deciliation is triggered by binding of fugu IgM to cell surface Ags via Ag binding sites. Moreover, concentrations of d-mannose - binding IgM in gill mucus were sufficient to induce deciliation in vitro, indicating that H. okamotoi parasites initially use host Abs to colonize host gills.",

The toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been reported as important factors in immune response against HCMV. Particularly, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 have been shown to be involved in antiviral immunity. Evaluation of the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), located within TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 genes, in the development of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in pregnant women and their fetuses and neonates, was performed. The study was performed for 131 pregnant women, including 66 patients infected with HCMV during pregnancy, and 65 age - matched control pregnant individuals. The patients were selected to the study, based on serological status of anti-HCMV IgG and IgM antibodies and on the presence of viral DNA in their body fluids. Genotypes in TLR2 2258 A > G, TLR4 896 G > A and 1196 C > T and TLR9 2848 G > A SNPs were determined by self-designed nested PCR - RFLP assays.

Images were fused to segment the whole liver normal tissue (WLNT) and the largest tumors. Fused images were reviewed and analyzed for comparison of absorbed dose (AD) to tumors and WLNT as calculated from (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT and from (90)Y PET/CT, subjective imaging comparison of (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT and (90)Y PET for tumors and WLNT, and correlation of tumoral AD with response on follow-up CT. Final analysis included 73 and 63 patients for WLNT and tumor (99m)Tc-MAA / (90)Y correlation, respectively, and 62 patients for AD vs response. (99m)Tc-MAA / (90)Y limit of agreement for each reviewer was viewed as clinically acceptable only for WLNT (-15 to 15 Gy). AD interreviewer variability was clinically acceptable for WLNT but was too broad for tumor. Mean tumor AD for objective response (78%) was 313 Gy vs 234 Gy for nonresponders. No threshold was found between tumor AD and response (P > .1). Catheter mismatch between (99m)Tc-MAA and (90)Y had a direct impact on AD mismatch between the 2 image sets. (99m)Tc-MAA was found to be a poor surrogate to quantitatively predict subsequent (90)Y AD to hepatocellular tumors. (99m)Tc-MAA distribution correlated with (90)Y distribution in the normal hepatic parenchyma.",
  "27242761": "Cobalamin Protection against Oxidative Stress in the Acidophilic Iron-oxidizing Bacterium Leptospirillum Group II CF-1 Members of the genus Leptospirillum are aerobic iron-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the phylum Nitrospira. They are important members of microbial communities that catalyze the biomining of sulfidic ores, thereby solubilizing metal ions. These microorganisms live under extremely acidic and metal -loaded environments and thus must tolerate high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a cobalt -containing tetrapyrrole cofactor involved in intramolecular rearrangement reactions and has recently been suggested to be an intracellular antioxidant. In this work, we investigated the effect of the exogenous addition of cobalamin on oxidative stress parameters in Leptospirillum group II strain CF-1. Our results revealed that the external supplementation of cobalamin reduces the levels of intracellular ROSs and the damage to biomolecules, and also stimulates the growth and survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress exerted by ferric ion, hydrogen peroxide, chromate and diamide. Furthermore, exposure of strain CF-1 to oxidative stress elicitors resulted in the transcriptional activation of the cbiA gene encoding CbiA of the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway. Altogether, these data suggest that cobalamin plays an important role in redox protection of Leptospirillum strain CF-1, supporting survival of this microorganism under extremely oxidative environmental conditions. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of cobalamin against oxidative stress may help to develop strategies to make biomining processes more effective.",
  "27503926": "SIRT2 Deacetylates and Inhibits the Peroxidase Activity of Peroxiredoxin-1 to Sensitize Breast Cancer Cells to Oxidant Stress - Inducing Agents SIRT2 is a protein deacetylase with tumor suppressor activity in breast and liver tumors where it is mutated; however, the critical substrates mediating its antitumor activity are not fully defined. Here we demonstrate that SIRT2 binds, deacetylates, and inhibits the peroxidase activity of the antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin (Prdx-1) in breast cancer cells. Ectopic overexpression of SIRT2, but not its catalytically dead mutant, increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by hydrogen peroxide, which led to increased levels of an overoxidized and multimeric form of Prdx-1 with activity as a molecular chaperone. Elevated levels of SIRT2 sensitized breast cancer cells to intracellular DNA damage and cell death induced by oxidative stress, as associated with increased levels of nuclear FOXO3A and the proapoptotic BIM protein. In addition, elevated levels of SIRT2 sensitized breast cancer cells to arsenic trioxide, an approved therapeutic agent, along with other intracellular ROS - inducing agents. Conversely, antisense RNA - mediated attenuation of SIRT2 reversed ROS - induced toxicity as demonstrated in a zebrafish embryo model system. Collectively, our findings suggest that the tumor suppressor activity of SIRT2 requires its ability to restrict the antioxidant activity of Prdx-1, thereby sensitizing breast cancer cells to ROS - induced DNA damage and cell cytotoxicity.

  "27678317": "Thyroid cancer burden in Central and South America Incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) is rapidly increasing worldwide, but little is known about the TC burden in Central and South America (CSA). We describe the geographic patterns and trends of TC by sex in CSA. We obtained regional - and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries and nationwide cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100,000 person - years. We calculated ASRs by histological subtype. We estimated the annual percentage change (EAPC) to describe time trends. Between CSA countries, TC incidence and mortality rates varied from 8-fold to 12-fold and from 2-fold to 5-fold, respectively. In 2003-2007, the highest TC ASRs in females and males were in Ecuador (16.0 and 3.5, respectively), Brazil (14.4 and 3.4), Costa Rica (12.6 and 2.1) and Colombia (10.7 and 2.5). The highest ASMRs were in Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Panama (0.68-0.91 in females and 0.41-0.48 in males). Papillary TC was the most commonly diagnosed histological subtype, following the same incidence pattern as overall TC. In Argentinean, Brazilian, Chilean and Costa Rican females TC incidence increased by 2.2-17.9% annually, and papillary TC increased by 9.1-15.0% annually, while mortality remained stable between 1997 and 2008. In males, trends in TC were stable. TC occurred more frequently in females than in males. The overall high incidence and low mortality of TC suggest identification of subclinical disease due to improved detection methods.",
  "27708808": "Managing perturbations during handover meetings: a joint activity framework To document the prevalence of perturbations of handover meetings and understand how nurses manage temporal, physical and social meeting boundaries in response to perturbations. Handovers are joint activities performed collaboratively by participating nurses. Perturbations of handover are frequent and may potentially threaten continuity of care. We observed and videotaped handovers during five successive days in four nursing care units in two Swiss hospitals in 2009. Videorecordings were transcribed. All perturbations during the handovers were noted. We performed content analysis of the sources of perturbations from the notes and interactional micro-analyses of handover interactions based on video and transcripts. Nurses are the most frequent sources of perturbations during handovers. Perturbations are collaboratively managed. A tacit division of labour is enacted via multimodal communication strategies, whereby perturbations are dealt with using both linguistic and bodily signals.",
  "28245982": "Comparative analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression profiles in cells and exosomes under toluene exposure Recent studies have illustrated the growing importance of exosomes (small extracellular vesicles) and their constituent microRNA s (miRNAs) in the fields of toxicology and pathology. The mechanism of toxicity of toluene, a highly-prevalent and volatile organic compound, is largely unknown. To examine the role of miRNAs in toluene-induced toxicity, we investigated miRNAs and toluene-induced gene expression in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and exosomes using microarrays. A total of 54 miRNAs were differentially expressed in HL-60 cell lines exposed to toluene and exosomes from the cells. Four out of the 54 miRNAs (hsa-miR-1290, hsa-miR-718, hsa-miR-3663-3p, and hsa-miR-320c) were subsequently validated by qRT-PCR. Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles identified 8 miRNA - mRNA correlations. By performing Comparative Toxicogenomics Database analysis, we found that the eight putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs under toluene exposure (EXOSC6, RHOH, GFER, HERC2, GOLGA4, SLC7A11, GCLM, and BACH1) are related to diverse disease categories such as nervous system disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory tract disease. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that miRNA - mRNA networks provide a better understanding of toxicological mechanism caused by environmental pollutants in vitro using HL-60 cells and exosomes.",
  "28282592": "Development of an automaton model of rotational activity driving atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is difficult to treat effectively, owing to uncertainty in where to best ablate to eliminate arrhythmogenic substrate. A model providing insight into the electrical activation events would be useful to guide catheter ablation strategy. Method A two-dimensional, 576×576 node automaton was developed to simulate atrial electrical activity. The substrate field was altered by the presence of differing refractory period at varying locations. Fibrosis was added in the form of short, randomly positioned lines of conduction block. Larger areas of block were used to simulate ablation lesions. Anisotropy was imposed in a 2:1 ratio. A premature electrical impulse from one of four grid corners was utilized to initiate activation. Rotational activity was uninducible when refractory patch dimensions were less than 20×20mm. For larger refractory regions, a single premature stimulus was capable of inducing an average of 1.19±1.10 rotors, which often formed near the patch edges. A maximum of 5 rotors formed when refractory patch dimensions approached the size of the entire left atrial virtual field. Rotors formed along a refractory patch edge, after wavefront arrival was delayed at turning points or due to the presence of a fiber cluster of sufficient size. However, rotational activity could also occur around a large fiber cluster without the need of spatially variable refractoriness. When obstacles to conduction were lacking in size, nascent rotors drifted and either extinguished, or stabilized upon anchoring at a sufficiently large fiber cluster elsewhere in the field. Transient rotors terminated when traversing a region with differing refractory periods, if no obstacle to conduction was present to sufficiently delay wavefront arrival beyond the longest refractory period. Other rotors were annihilated when a nearby rotor with faster spin rate gradually interrupted the activation pathway. Elimination of anchors by removal, or by simulated ablation over a sufficient region, prevented rotor onset at a particular location where it would otherwise form. The presence of obstacles to conduction and spatial differences in refractory period are important parameters for initiating and maintaining rotational activity in this simulation of an atrial substrate.",

  "27834836": "Proteomic Analysis of Tung Tree (Vernicia fordii) Oilseeds during the Developmental Stages The tung tree (Vernicia fordii), a non-model woody plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family, is a promising economic plant due to the high content of a novel high-value oil in its seeds. Many metabolic pathways are active during seed development. Oil (triacylglycerols (TAGs)) accumulates in oil bodies distributed in the endosperm cells of tung tree seeds. The relationship between oil bodies and oil content during tung tree seed development was analyzed using ultrastructural observations, which confirmed that oil accumulation was correlated with the volumes and numbers of oil bodies in the endosperm cells during three different developmental stages. For a deeper understanding of seed development, we carried out proteomic analyses. At least 144 proteins were differentially expressed during three different developmental stages. A total of 76 proteins were successfully identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS / MS). These proteins were grouped into 11 classes according to their functions. The major groups of differentially expressed proteins were associated with energy metabolism (25%), fatty acid metabolism (15.79%) and defense (14.47%). These results strongly suggested that a very high percentage of gene expression in seed development is dedicated to the synthesis and accumulation of TAGs.",

Although a few studies have described the role of a thymectomy in the treatment of MG in Asians countries, there are no published data on the application of this surgical approach for MG in Malaysia. We aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of MG patients who underwent a thymectomy and the factors affecting these outcomes. This was a retrospective study involving 16 patients with MG who underwent a thymectomy at the Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) from January 2002 until December 2012, with a follow-up period ranging from 3-120 months. The study consisted of 16 patients aged 22-78 years, 10 of whom were males. The overall remission / improvement rate was 87.5%, and the rate of clinical outcomes classified as unchanged / worsened was 12.5%. Thymomamatous or non-thymomamatous MG, histology features, Osserman stage and the duration of follow-up were not significant prognostic factors. Post-operative mortality was 6.2% (1 of 16 patients died of septic shock). A thymectomy seems to be an effective treatment for MG, with low surgical morbidity. Patients with a lower Osserman stage and those with/without thymomas had favourable outcomes.",

Performing a root cause analysis (RCA) of serious AEs is one systematic way of determining the causes of these events. Multidisciplinary teams were formed at Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative (MAQI(2)) sites with organized anticoagulation management services (AMS). Medical records from patients who suffered serious AEs (major bleed, embolic stroke, venous thromboembolism) were reviewed, and AMS staff were interviewed to determine the root cause using the \"5 Whys\" technique. More than 600 patients had an AE and underwent screening by trained RNs. Of these, 79 required full review by a multidisciplinary panel. All potential contributing factors (comorbidities, concurrent medications, current protocols) were assessed to determine the main factor that caused the AE. Full RCA was completed in 79 cases. The main contributing factor was identified in 69/79 (87%) cases. Most identified AEs, 55/69 (80%), were due to patient - specific factors such as comorbidities. Patient -to- provider and provider -to- provider communication accounted for 16/69 (23%) of events and was the second most common cause. Other causes included protocol non-adherence and technology / equipment issues. After each detailed review, the multidisciplinary panel recommended system changes that addressed the primary cause. The majority of severe AEs for patients taking warfarin were related to nonmodifiable patient -related issues. The remaining AEs were primarily due to patient -to- provider and provider -to- provider communication issues. Methods for improving communication need to be addressed, and methods for more effective patient education should be investigated.",
  "27255214": "Hierarchical Targeting Strategy for Enhanced Tumor Tissue Accumulation / Retention and Cellular Internalization Targeted delivery of therapeutic agents is an important way to improve the therapeutic index and reduce side effects. To design nanoparticles for targeted delivery, both enhanced tumor tissue accumulation / retention and enhanced cellular internalization should be considered simultaneously. So far, there have been very few nanoparticles with immutable structures that can achieve this goal efficiently. Hierarchical targeting, a novel targeting strategy based on stimuli responsiveness, shows good potential to enhance both tumor tissue accumulation / retention and cellular internalization. Here, the recent design and development of hierarchical targeting nanoplatforms, based on changeable particle sizes, switchable surface charges and activatable surface ligands, will be introduced. In general, the targeting moieties in these nanoplatforms are not activated during blood circulation for efficient tumor tissue accumulation, but re-activated by certain internal or external stimuli in the tumor microenvironment for enhanced cellular internalization.",

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the effectiveness of platelet rich plasma (PRP) vs steroid in reducing pain and improving function of the elbow in the treatment of LE. A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify related articles published from January 1980 to September 2016 in Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and SpringerLink. All studies that compared PRP with steroid administration on LE were included. Main outcomes were collected and analyzed by the Review Manager 5.1. Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved 511 patients met the criteria. This meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in pain relief in the short-term (2 to 4 weeks: SMD = 1.02, P = .03; 6 to 8 weeks: SMD = .73, P = .24) and the intermediate-term (12 weeks: SMD = -0.28, P = .35). Steroid exhibited a better efficacy of function in the short-term (2 to 4 weeks: SMD = .61, P < .001; 6 to 8 weeks: SMD = .53, P < .001). However, PRP was superior to steroid for pain relief in the long-term (half year: SMD = -1.6, P < .001; one year: SMD = -1.45, P < .001), and also for function improving in the intermediate-term (12 weeks: SMD = -0.53, P < .001) and the long-term (half year: SMD = -0.56, P < .001; one year: SMD = -0.7, P < .001). No serious adverse effects of treatment were observed in the two groups. Treatment of patients with LE by steroid could slightly relieve pain and significantly improve function of elbow in the short-term (2 to 4 weeks, 6 to 8 weeks). PRP appears to be more effective in relieving pain and improving function in the intermediate-term (12 weeks) and long-term (half year and one year). Considering the long-term effectiveness of PRP, we recommend PRP as the preferred option for LE.",
  "27270311": "Direct contact with perivascular tumor cells enhances integrin αvβ3 signaling and migration of endothelial cells The secretion of soluble pro-angiogenic factors by tumor cells and stromal cells in the perivascular niche promotes the aggressive angiogenesis that is typical of glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we show that angiogenesis also can be promoted by a direct interaction between brain tumor cells, including tumor cells with cancer stem -like properties (CSCs), and endothelial cells (ECs). As shown in vitro, this direct interaction is mediated by binding of integrin αvβ3 expressed on ECs to the RGD-peptide in L1CAM expressed on CSCs. It promotes both EC network formation and enhances directed migration toward basic fibroblast growth factor. Activation of αvβ3 and bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome X (BMX) is required for migration stimulated by direct binding but not for migration stimulated by soluble factors. RGD-peptide treatment of mice with established intracerebral GBM xenografts significantly reduced the percentage of Sox2 -positive tumor cells and CSCs in close proximity to ECs, decreased integrin αvβ3 and BMX activation and p130CAS phosphorylation in the ECs, and reduced the vessel surface area. These results reveal a previously unrecognized aspect of the regulation of angiogenesis in GBM that can impact therapeutic anti-angiogenic targeting.",
  "28515354": "Clinical application and outcomes of sentinel node navigation surgery in patients with early gastric cancer Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) has been recognized as a minimally invasive tool for individualized lymphadenectomy in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC). The aim of this study was to compare clinicopathological factors, adverse events, and clinical outcomes between sentinel node mapping (SNM) and SN dissection (SND) groups and assess the clinical utility of SNNS in patients with EGC. The clinical data of 157 patients with EGC, diagnosed as clinical T1N0M0 with tumors ≤ 40 mm, undergoing SNNS between March 2004 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven patients were excluded from the analysis. In the remaining 130 patients, 59 and 71 patients underwent standard lymphadenectomy for SNM and SND, respectively. The sentinel node detection rate in the SNM and SND groups was 98.3% (58/59) and 100% (71/71), respectively. Two (3.5%), 15 (25.9%), and 41 (70.7%) patients having sentinel nodes underwent total gastrectomy, proximal gastrectomy (PG), and distal gastrectomy (DG), respectively, in the SNM group. One (1.4%), 5 (7.0%), 10 (14.1%), 39 (54.9%), and 16 (22.5%) patients underwent PG, DG, segmental gastrectomy, local resection, and endoscopic submucosal dissection, respectively, in the SND group. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the SNM and SND groups (P = 0.781). Survival did not differ between the both groups (P = 0.856). The present results suggest that personalized surgery with SND provides technical safety and curability related with a favorable survival outcome in patients with EGC.",
  "27532819": "Self-Cloning CRISPR CRISPR/Cas9 - gene editing has emerged as a revolutionary technology to easily modify specific genomic loci by designing complementary sgRNA sequences and introducing these into cells along with Cas9. Self-cloning CRISPR/Cas9 (scCRISPR) uses a self-cleaving palindromic sgRNA plasmid (sgPal) that recombines with short PCR - amplified site-specific sgRNA sequences within the target cell by homologous recombination to circumvent the process of sgRNA plasmid construction. Through this mechanism, scCRISPR enables gene editing within 2 hr once sgRNA oligos are available, with high efficiency equivalent to conventional sgRNA targeting: >90% gene knockout in both mouse and human embryonic stem cells and cancer cell lines. Furthermore, using PCR-based addition of short homology arms, we achieve efficient site-specific knock-in of transgenes such as GFP without traditional plasmid cloning or genome-integrated selection cassette (2% to 4% knock-in rate).

This study evaluated the impact of ENGAGE on frontline service providers' self-reported knowledge, skills, capacity and practice up to 5-months post training. Between 2012 and 2015, ENGAGE Trainers (n = 57) delivered 62 1-day training programmes to 810 participants. This study was conducted on a subset of those training days (n = 26) and participants. Quantitative methodologies were used to collect pre (n = 295), post (n = 295) and 5-month post (n = 128) training questionnaire data. Overall, participants were highly satisfied with the training immediately post training (8.60 ± 1.60 out of 10) and at 5-month follow up (8.06 ± 1.43 out of 10). Participants' self-reported level of knowledge, skill and capacity in identifying priorities, engaging men and influencing practice beyond their own organisation increased immediately following training (P < 0.001) and, with the exception of improving capacity to engage men and influencing practice beyond their organisation, these improvements were sustained at 5-month post training (P < 0.001). The vast majority of service providers (93.4%) reported that ENGAGE had impacted their work practice up to 5-month post training. The findings suggest that ENGAGE has succeeded in improving service providers' capacity to engage and work with men; improving gender competency in the delivery of health and health related services may increase the utilisation of such services by men and thereby improve health outcomes for men.",

Systemic alitretinoin has been shown to be effective in patients with CHE who are refractory to topical corticosteroids. To analyse the impact of alitretinoin on the skin barrier genes and protein expression in the skin lesions of patients with CHE. Fifteen patients with CHE were treated with 30 mg daily of alitretinoin for up to 27 weeks. Disease severity was assessed using a clinical score. Skin biopsies from all the patients were evaluated before and after therapy for the expression of Ki-67, various skin barrier genes and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. After alitretinoin application, an improvement in the clinical severity of CHE was observed in the majority of patients. Analysis of skin biopsies before treatment showed a significant increase in Ki-67 - positive cells in the suprabasal layer and a dysregulated expression of various skin barrier genes, such as claudin 1, loricrin, filaggrin and cytokeratin 10, which were normalized after treatment. TSLP was significantly upregulated in patients with CHE and also normalized after alitretinoin treatment and negatively correlated with filaggrin. Our data indicate that the expression of barrier genes and proteins was normalized following treatment with alitretinoin in patients with CHE. The change in expression levels of these genes correlated with the clinical efficacy, suggesting that alitretinoin exhibits a disease - modifying activity. TSLP is upregulated in CHE and seems to counteract filaggrin expression in the skin.",

We developed a 12-lead smartphone -based electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition and monitoring system (called \" cvrPhone \"), and an application to assess underlying ischemia, and estimate the respiration rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV) from analysis of electrocardiographic (ECG) signals only. During in-vivo swine studies (n = 6), 12-lead ECG signals were recorded at baseline and following coronary artery occlusion. Ischemic indices calculated from each lead showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase within 2 min of occlusion compared to baseline. Following myocardial infarction, spontaneous ventricular tachycardia episodes (n = 3) were preceded by significant (p < 0.05) increase of the ischemic index ~1-4 min prior to the onset of the tachy-arrhythmias. In order to assess the respiratory status during apnea, the mechanical ventilator was paused for up to 2 min during normal breathing. We observed that the RR and TV estimation algorithms detected apnea within 7.9 ± 1.1 sec and 5.5 ± 2.2 sec, respectively, while the estimated RR and TV values were 0 breaths/min and less than 100 ml, respectively. In conclusion, the cvrPhone can be used to detect myocardial ischemia and periods of respiratory apnea using a readily available mobile platform.",

In this study, we examined whether combinations of opioid and cannabinoid receptor agonists directed at the injured site would enhance therapeutic effectiveness. Behavioral pharmacology experiments were performed to compare the effects of DAMGO, a selective agonist for μ-opioid receptor (MOR), ACPA, a specific agonist for CB1, and combinations of DAMGO and ACPA in attenuating complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in the rat hindpaw. DAMGO (1μg-1mg) or ACPA (1μg-2mg) was administered into the inflamed paw when mechanical hyperalgesia was fully developed. When administered individually, DAMGO and ACPA dose -dependently reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia. DAMGO displayed a lower ED50 value (57.4±2.49μg) than ACPA (111.6±2.18μg), but ACPA produced longer lasting antihyperalgesic effects. Combinations of DAMGO and ACPA also dose -dependently attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia, but the antihyperalgesic effects were partial and transient even at high doses. Using isobolographic analysis, we determined that combined treatment with DAMGO and ACPA produced antagonistic effects with the observed ED50 of 128.4±2.28μg. Our findings showed that MOR and CB1 agonists directed at the inflamed site effectively attenuate mechanical hyperalgesia when administered individually, but exert opposing effects when administered together. The antagonistic interactions between the two classes of drugs at the inflamed site suggest distinct mechanisms unique to peripheral nociceptors or inflamed tissue, and therefore require further studies to investigate whether the therapeutic utility of the combined drug treatments in chronic pain conditions can be optimized.",

The New York Eye & Ear Infirmary of Mt. Sinai, New York, New York, USA. Retrospective case reports and experimental study. Observations of live cataract surgery were documented with high-definition videography using 3 commercial phacoemulsification platforms. Laboratory studies using a Photron MC2 high-speed camera and the Kitaro cataract surgical system were used to simulate surgical maneuvers and assess flow patterns and visualize the dynamics of fluid movement in the anterior chamber. Color-flow Doppler ultrasound studies were used to demonstrate the effect of infusion fluid on the iris during surgery. Misdirected infusion and floppy-iris leaflets were determined to be secondary to a fulcrum effect at the corneal wound that constrained movement of the standard silicone sleeves. The phacoemulsification needles could therefore decenter independently of the infusion sleeve, attenuating infusion volume down 1 side of the sleeve and, as a result, obstructing fluid exiting the ipsilateral port. Untoward events associated with aberrant fluid infusion during phacoemulsification surgery were secondary to a fulcrum effect at the corneal wound. Complications included misdirected infusion that facilitated the transport of retained nuclear fragments to the vitreous, inconsistent lens followability during phacoemulsification, and exaggerated movements of the iris particularly consistent with intraoperative floppy-iris syndrome and pseudoexfoliation. None of the authors has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.",
  "27571215": "Vasopressin regulates the growth of the biliary epithelium in polycystic liver disease The neurohypophysial hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) acts by three distinct receptor subtypes: V1a, V1b, and V2. In the liver, AVP is involved in ureogenesis, glycogenolysis, neoglucogenesis and regeneration. No data exist about the presence of AVP in the biliary epithelium. Cholangiocytes are the target cells in a number of animal models of cholestasis, including bile duct ligation (BDL), and in several human pathologies, such as polycystic liver disease characterized by the presence of cysts that bud from the biliary epithelium. In vivo, liver fragments from normal and BDL mice and rats as well as liver samples from normal and ADPKD patients were collected to evaluate: (i) intrahepatic bile duct mass by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin-19; and (ii) expression of V1a, V1b and V2 by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and real-time PCR. In vitro, small and large mouse cholangiocytes, H69 (non-malignant human cholangiocytes) and LCDE (human cholangiocytes from the cystic epithelium) were stimulated with vasopressin in the absence/ presence of AVP antagonists such as OPC-31260 and Tolvaptan, before assessing cellular growth by MTT assay and cAMP levels. Cholangiocytes express V2 receptor that was upregulated following BDL and in ADPKD liver samples. Administration of AVP increased proliferation and cAMP levels of small cholangiocytes and LCDE cells. We found no effect in the proliferation of large mouse cholangiocytes and H69 cells. Increases were blocked by preincubation with the AVP antagonists. These results showed that AVP and its receptors may be important in the modulation of the proliferation rate of the biliary epithelium.",
  "28463933": "Brief Potentially Ictal Rhythmic Discharges [B(I)RDs] in Noncritically Ill Adults Brief potentially ictal rhythmic discharges (B(I)RDs) have been described in neonates and critically ill adults, and their association with seizures has been demonstrated. Their significance in noncritically ill adults remains unclear. We aimed to investigate their prevalence, electrographic characteristics, and clinical significance. We identified adult patients with B(I)RDs who received long-term EEG recordings either in the epilepsy monitoring unit or in the ambulatory setting. Patients with acute findings on imaging or status epilepticus were excluded. B(I)RDs were defined as very brief (<10 seconds) runs of focal or generalized sharply contoured rhythmic activity greater than 4 Hz, with or without evolution, that were not consistent with any known normal or benign pattern. The clinical history, EEG, and imaging results were retrieved. Each patient with B(I)RDs was matched by age and etiology to a control group with epileptiform discharges but without B(I)RDs in a 1:2 ratio. We identified B(I)RDs in 15 patients of 1,230 EEGs (1.2%). The pattern typically consisted of 0.5 to 4 second runs of sharply contoured alpha activity without evolution. All patients with B(I)RDs had epilepsy, and, when compared with controls with epilepsy but without BIRDs, were more likely to be medically refractory (10 of 15 [67%] vs. 5 of 30 [17%]; P < 0.01). All seizure onsets colocalized to the B(I)RDs, and most were morphologically similar. In noncritically ill patients, B(I)RDs are associated with refractory epilepsy and their location is correlated with the seizure onset area.",
  "28288758": "Epidemiological patterns of bovine besnoitiosis in an endemic beef cattle herd reared under extensive conditions Bovine besnoitiosis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Besnoitia besnoiti. Described many decades ago, recent epidemiological studies reveal its important spread within Europe in the last years. To date, many epidemiological aspects related to life cycle, routes of transmission, incidence rates and associated risk factors are lacking; hence, the establishment of appropriate disease control programmes poses an important challenge. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the epidemiological pattern of the disease in an endemic herd reared under extensive conditions (Spanish Pyrenees) by identifying main factors associated with infection and clinical disease dynamics. The study population consisted of 276 Brown Swiss and Pirenaica adult animals and 145 calves born and weaned at the farm during the study. Three sampling time frames were used: January 2010, September 2010 and February 2011, which allowed us to differentiate two periods designated as mountain and valley periods. The data related to animals (breed, sex and age) and herd management (animal grouping and time in housing) were recorded. The data collection methodology was mainly based on clinical examinations and defining the serological status against bovine besnoitiosis by the immunofluorescent antibody testing of blood samples. The total prevalence among adult animals was 38.34% (CI 95%: 34.53-42.07), with 18.54% of seropositive animals showing clinical signs. In regard to the cumulative incidence, 34.57% of new infections were detected during the mountain period, in contrast to the 24.59% observed in the valley period. The incidence density was 0.058 and 0.061 new infections per animal - month for the mountain and valley periods, respectively. According to the seroepidemiological study, the seroconversion probability of B. besnoiti infection was directly associated with the number of seropositive cows with whom an animal had been stabled as well as the housing period duration, supporting horizontal transmission by close contact as one of the most important methods of disease spread. In addition, the risk of developing the clinical course increased with age, and the presence of clinical signs was related to higher antibody responses. Among calves (from 3.1 to 7.1 months old) sampled once at weaning, the total seroprevalence was 15.17% (CI 95%: 9.36-21.04), and the chronic stage was observed in three animals, supporting the ability of B. besnoiti to infect and even cause disease in animals less than 6 months old. Finally, the risk of calf seroconversion was positively related to the serological status of the cows, suggesting postnatal transmission between dams and offspring by contact during the suckling period.",

Rats were divided into 6 groups. The first group was the control, group 2 was treated with cisplatin (7 mg/kg, single dose), and groups 3 to 6 received cisplatin with vitamin E (100 mg/kg) and Plantago major extract at doses of 300 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg, and 1200 mg/kg, for 20 days. On day12, serum concentration of urea, creatinine, and potassium significantly increased and sodium concentration significantly decreased in the cisplatin group compared with the control rats. However, serum creatinine, urea, and potassium concentrations were significantly lower in all of the Plantago major groups compared to the cisplatin group. Also, there was a significant elevation in serum sodium concentration in the Plantago major 600 mg/kg group compared to the cisplatin group on day12. Injection of cisplatin caused a significant elevation in malondialdehyde concentration but a significant decrease in catalase activity and total thiol content compared to the control group. Plantago major extract at 1200 mg/kg significantly improved malondialdehyde concentration and total thiol content compared to the cisplatin group. Catalase activity with Plantago major significantly increased at all doses compared to the cisplatin group. The current study suggests that Plantago major extract and vitamin E are able to improve kidney function as well as oxidative stress in cisplatin -induced renal toxicity in the rat.",

Colitis in patients with PSC and UC (PSC - UC) exhibits characteristic features and is linked to increased colon cancer risk. Genetic studies have identified immune - related susceptibility genes that only partially overlap with those involved in IBD. These observations suggest that PSC - UC may represent a distinct form of IBD. It remains to be elucidated whether different immune-mechanisms are involved in colitis in these patients. We aimed to evaluate systemic and intestinal T-cell and innate lymphoid cell (ILC) responses, previously associated to IBD, in patients with PSC - UC compared to patients with UC and healthy controls. Blood samples and colorectal biopsies were collected from patients with PSC - UC, patients with UC and healthy controls. T-cell and ILC phenotype was analysed by multicolour flow cytometry. Chemokine receptor (CCR) profiling of circulating T-cell s showed decreased CCR6-CXCR3+ Th1 cells in PSC - UC, but increased CCR6-CCR4+ Th2 cells only in UC, while increased CCR6+CCR4+ Th17 cells were found in both patient groups compared to healthy controls. Increased frequencies of IFN-γ secreting T-cells were found in the colon of patients with PSC - UC compared to UC. Interestingly, we observed accumulation of ILC in the colon in PSC - UC. Our study suggests that PSC - UC represent a different immunological disorder from UC, characterised by increased intestinal Th1 and ILC responses. These results provide further evidence that PSC - UC may represent a distinct form of IBD.",
  "28477843": "Development and validation of an easy-to-use risk assessment tool for cumulative low back loading: The Lifting Fatigue Failure Tool (LiFFT) Recent evidence suggests that musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) may be the result of a fatigue failure process in affected tissues. This paper describes a new low back exposure assessment tool (the Lifting Fatigue Failure Tool [LiFFT]), which estimates a \" daily dose \" of cumulative loading on the low back using fatigue failure principles. Only three variables are necessary to derive the cumulative load associated with a lifting task: the weight of the load, the maximum horizontal distance from the spine to the load, and the number of repetitions for tasks performed during the workday. The new tool was validated using two existing epidemiological databases: the Lumbar Motion Monitor (LMM) database, and a database from a U.S. automotive manufacturer. The LiFFT cumulative damage metric explained 92% of the deviance in low back disorders (LBDs) in the LMM database and 72-95% of the deviance in low back outcomes in the automotive database (depending on the outcome measure). Thus, LiFFT is practitioner friendly and its cumulative damage metric highly related to low back outcomes.",

Crude extract was obtained by enzymatic digestion and isolated by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The fraction with higher yield was used in the tests (SP-Ul). Swiss mice received SP-Ul (1, 3 or 9mg/kg; i.v.), 30min prior to injection of 0.8%- acetic acid or 1%- formalin or prior to a thermal stimulus. At same doses, SP-Ul was tested on Wistar rats on paw edema elicited by different irritants (carrageenan, dextran, bradykinin, histamine or serotonin). The results of infrared characterization indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups, sulfate, uronic acid and glycosidic linkages in all SP fractions spectrums. SP-Ul decreased significantly the antinociception in response to acetic acid or formalin (second phase), but not in the hot-plate test, suggesting that its analgesia occurs through a peripheral mechanism. SP-Ul did not reduce carrageenan - induced paw edema as supported by both histological and myeloperoxidase activity assessments. However, SP-Ul (1mg/kg; s.c.) reduced dextran -elicited edema, showing vascular anti-inflammatory effect, with bradykinin as major target because it did not reduce histamine - and serotonin - induced paw edemas. Therefore, SP-Ul acts on bradykinin pathway in its antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory responses.",
  "27817780": "Identification of gene mutation and prenatal diagnosis in a family with X-linked ichthyosis X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) is a metabolic disease with steroid sulfatase deficiency and often occurs at birth or shortly after birth. The encoding gene of steroid sulfatase, STS, is located on the short arm of the X chromosome, and STS deletion or mutation can lead to the development of this disease. This study collected the data on the clinical phenotype from a family, and the proband, a boy aged 11 years with full-term vaginal delivery, had dry and rough skin and black-brown scaly patches, mainly in the abdomen and extensor aspect of extremities. Peripheral blood samples were collected from each family member and DNA was extracted. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to measure the copy number of STS on the X chromosome. Whole-genome microarray was used to determine the size of the segment with microdeletion in the X chromosome. MLPA was then used for prenatal diagnosis for the mother of the proband. The results revealed that the proband and another two male patients had hemizygotes in STS deletion. Gene microarray identified a rare deletion with a size of 1.6 Mb at Xp22.31 (chrX: 6,516,735-8,131,442). Two female family members were found to be carriers. Prenatal diagnosis showed that the fetus carried by the proband's mother was a carrier of this microdeletion. This study showed STS gene deletion in this family of XLI, which causes the unique skin lesions of XLI. MLPA is a convenient and reliable technique for the molecular and prenatal diagnosis of XLI.",
  "28115057": "Optogenetic Demonstration of Functional Innervation of Mouse Colon by Neurons Derived From Transplanted Neural Cells Cell therapy offers the potential to treat gastrointestinal motility disorders caused by diseased or absent enteric neurons. We examined whether neurons generated from transplanted enteric neural cells provide a functional innervation of bowel smooth muscle in mice. Enteric neural cells expressing the light-sensitive ion channel, channelrhodopsin, were isolated from the fetal or postnatal mouse bowel and transplanted into the distal colon of 3- to 4- week -old wild-type recipient mice. Intracellular electrophysiological recordings of responses to light stimulation of the transplanted cells were made from colonic smooth muscle cells in recipient mice. Electrical stimulation of endogenous enteric neurons was used as a control. The axons of graft -derived neurons formed a plexus in the circular muscle layer. Selective stimulation of graft -derived cells by light resulted in excitatory and inhibitory junction potentials, the electrical events underlying contraction and relaxation, respectively, in colonic muscle cells. Graft -derived excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons released the same neurotransmitters as endogenous motor neurons - acetylcholine and a combination of adenosine triphosphate and nitric oxide, respectively. Graft -derived neurons also included interneurons that provided synaptic inputs to motor neurons, but the pharmacologic properties of interneurons varied with the age of the donors from which enteric neural cells were obtained. Enteric neural cells transplanted into the bowel give rise to multiple functional types of neurons that integrate and provide a functional innervation of the smooth muscle of the bowel wall. Circuits composed of both motor neurons and interneurons were established, but the age at which cells are isolated influences the neurotransmitter phenotype of interneurons that are generated.",
  "27352133": "The phonetic landscape in infant consonant perception is an uneven terrain Previous research revealing universal biases in infant vowel perception forms the basis of the Natural Referent Vowel (NRV) framework (Polka & Bohn, 2011). To explore the feasibility of extending this framework to consonant manner perception, we investigated perception of the stop vs. fricative consonant contrast /b/-/v/ to test the hypothesis that young infants will display a perceptual bias grounded in the acoustic - phonetic properties of these sounds. We examined perception of stop-initial /bas/ and fricative-initial /vas/ syllables in English - learning and French - learning 5- to 6-month-olds. The /b/ and /v/ sounds distinguish words in English and French but have different distributional patterns; in spoken English /b/ occurs more frequently than /v/ whereas in spoken French /v/ occurs more frequently than /b/. A perceptual bias favoring /b/ over /v/ emerged in two experiments. In Experiment 1, a directional asymmetry was observed in discrimination; infants noticed when /vas/ changed to /bas/ but not when /bas/ changed to /vas/. In Experiment 2, a robust listening preference favoring stop-initial /bas/ was evident in responses from the same infants. This is the first study to show a perceptual bias related to consonant manner and to directly measure a consonant perception bias within the same infants. These data encourage further efforts to extend the NRV principles to perception of consonant manner. These findings indicate that we need to reform our view of infant speech perception to accommodate the fact that both discrimination abilities and biases shape speech perception during infancy.",
  "27634004": "Young Children See a Single Action and Infer a Social Norm Human social life depends heavily on social norms that prescribe and proscribe specific actions. Typically, young children learn social norms from adult instruction. In the work reported here, we showed that this is not the whole story: Three- year-old children are promiscuous normativists. In other words, they spontaneously inferred the presence of social norms even when an adult had done nothing to indicate such a norm in either language or behavior. And children of this age even went so far as to enforce these self-inferred norms when third parties \"broke\" them. These results suggest that children do not just passively acquire social norms from adult behavior and instruction; rather, they have a natural and proactive tendency to go from \"is\" to \"ought.\" That is, children go from observed actions to prescribed actions and do not perceive them simply as guidelines for their own behavior but rather as objective normative rules applying to everyone equally.",
  "28338634": "Construction of an Acetylcholinesterase Sensor Based on Synthesized Paramagnetic Nanoparticles, a Simple Tool for Neurotoxic Compounds Assay Magnetic particles (MPs) have been widely used in biological applications in recent years as a carrier for various molecules. Their big advantage is in repeated use of immobilized molecules including enzymes. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme playing crucial role in neurotransmission and the enzyme is targeted by various molecules like Alzheimer's drugs, pesticides and warfare agents. In this work, an electrochemical biosensor having AChE immobilized onto MPs and stabilized through glutaraldehyde (GA) molecule was proposed for assay of the neurotoxic compounds. The prepared nanoparticles were modified by pure AChE and they were used for the measurement anti-Alzheimer's drug galantamine and carbamate pesticide carbofuran with limit of detection 1.5 µM and 20 nM, respectively. All measurements were carried out using screen-printed sensor with carbon working, silver reference, and carbon auxiliary electrode. Standard Ellman's assay was used for validation measurement of both inhibitors. Part of this work was the elimination of reversible inhibitors represented by galantamine from the active site of AChE. For this purpose, we used a lower pH to get the original activity of AChE after inhibition by galantamine. We also observed decarbamylation of the AChE - carbofuran adduct. Influence of organic solvents to AChE as well as repeatability of measurement with MPs with AChE was also established.",
  "27563025": "The construction of three-dimensional composite fibrous macrostructures with nanotextures for biomedical applications The development of modern biomedical nanotechnology requires three-dimensional macrostructures with nanotextures to meet the requirements for practical applications in intricate biological systems. Additionally, the restoration and regeneration of some specific body tissues and organs rely on the function of conductive polymers, which can provide electrical cues for cells. In this study, we fabricated three-dimensional composite nanofibre macrostructures of polycaprolactone (PCL) with different concentrations of polyaniline (PANi) by employing an improved electrospinning technology with a specially designed collector. The 3D structures possessed cap-like macrostructures with centimetre-scale thickness and interconnected pore nanotextures with nanometre-scale nanofibres. To estimate the biocompatibility of the 3D PCL / PANi composite nanofibre macrostructures, mouse myoblasts (C2C12 cells) were cultured as model cells. The initial responses of C2C12 cells to the 3D PCL / PANi composite macrostructures were significantly superior to those to pure PCL, that is, the cells exhibited typical myoblast-like morphologies with obvious pseudopodia and the moderate incorporation (less than 2.0 wt%) of conductive PANi facilitated cell proliferation, which indicated that PANi has appreciable cell affinity. Moreover, the addition of conductive PANi to the 3D composite nanofibre macrostructures considerably enhanced myoblast differentiation and myotube maturation. These results suggest that electrospun 3D PCL / PANi composite nanofibre macrostructures would have promising applications in tissue engineering.",

  "28539349": "Sleep Loss Promotes Astrocytic Phagocytosis and Microglial Activation in Mouse Cerebral Cortex We previously found that Mertk and its ligand Gas6, astrocytic genes involved in phagocytosis, are upregulated after acute sleep deprivation. These results suggested that astrocytes may engage in phagocytic activity during extended wake, but direct evidence was lacking. Studies in humans and rodents also found that sleep loss increases peripheral markers of inflammation, but whether these changes are associated with neuroinflammation and/or activation of microglia, the brain's resident innate immune cells, was unknown. Here we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to obtain 3D volume measurements of synapses and surrounding astrocytic processes in mouse frontal cortex after 6-8 h of sleep, spontaneous wake, or sleep deprivation (SD) and after chronic (∼5 d) sleep restriction (CSR). Astrocytic phagocytosis, mainly of presynaptic components of large synapses, increased after both acute and chronic sleep loss relative to sleep and wake. MERTK expression and lipid peroxidation in synaptoneurosomes also increased to a similar extent after short and long sleep loss, suggesting that astrocytic phagocytosis may represent the brain's response to the increase in synaptic activity associated with prolonged wake, clearing worn components of heavily used synapses. Using confocal microscopy, we then found that CSR but not SD mice show morphological signs of microglial activation and enhanced microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, without obvious signs of neuroinflammation in the CSF. Because low - level sustained microglia activation can lead to abnormal responses to a secondary insult, these results suggest that chronic sleep loss, through microglia priming, may predispose the brain to further damage .SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We find that astrocytic phagocytosis of synaptic elements, mostly of presynaptic origin and in large synapses, is upregulated already after a few hours of sleep deprivation and shows a further significant increase after prolonged and severe sleep loss, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping of heavily used and strong synapses in response to the increased neuronal activity of extended wake. By contrast, chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss activates microglia, promotes their phagocytic activity, and does so in the absence of overt signs of neuroinflammation, suggesting that like many other stressors, extended sleep disruption may lead to a state of sustained microglia activation, perhaps increasing the brain's susceptibility to other forms of damage.",
  "28284685": "Identifying priorities to improve paediatric in-hospital antimicrobial use by cross-sectional evaluation of prevalence and appropriateness of prescription Information about paediatric in-hospital antimicrobial usage and prescribing patterns to guide improvement strategies is scant. We aim to use an evaluation of the prevalence and appropriateness of antimicrobial prescription to identify antimicrobial stewardship priorities in children. A cross-sectional point study was performed on hospitalised paediatric patients in a Spanish tertiary hospital, assessing the prevalence of antimicrobial prescription (PAP) and appropriateness of antimicrobial prescription (AAP). AAP was defined as a correct indication plus an appropriate prescribing pattern (dose, spectrum and interval). Evaluation was performed using established antimicrobial guidelines. Other factors that may have a bearing on antimicrobial prescription were also analysed. A total of 171 patients were included. PAP was 49.7% (85/171) and AAP was 60.9% (91/161). The most common indications for antimicrobial use were antimicrobial prophylaxis (28.3%, 32/113) and pneumonia (8.2%, 8/113). Overall, 161 antimicrobials were prescribed (1.9 antimicrobials per patient): 55.3% (89/161) were empiric, 16.1% (26/161) were targeted and 28.6% (46/161) were prophylactic. Amoxicillin/clavulanate (8.2%, 14/171) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (8.2%, 14/171) were the most prescribed antimicrobials. The prescription of antifungals (11.7%, 20/171) and antivirals (1.8%, 3/171) was analysed. Major causes of inappropriate antibiotic use were prolonged prescriptions (21.7%, 35/161) and use of agents with an excessively broad coverage spectrum (21.1%, 34/161). PAP and AAP varied between wards and antimicrobials. Measurement of PAP and AAP offers valuable information for detecting priorities in hospital settings and monitoring antimicrobial usage prior to the development of antimicrobial stewardship programmes. In our setting, the main areas for improvement are duration of therapy and proper use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials.",
  "28447828": "Gender Differences in Depression in Representative National Samples: Meta-Analyses of Diagnoses and Symptoms In 2 meta-analyses on gender differences in depression in nationally representative samples, we advance previous work by including studies of depression diagnoses and symptoms to (a) estimate the magnitude of the gender difference in depression across a wide array of nations and ages; (b) use a developmental perspective to elucidate patterns of gender differences across the life span; and (c) incorporate additional theory-driven moderators (e.g., gender equity). For major depression diagnoses and depression symptoms, respectively, we meta-analyzed data from 65 and 95 articles and their corresponding national data sets, representing data from 1,716,195 and 1,922,064 people in over 90 different nations. Overall, odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.88, 2.03], and d = 0.27 [0.26, 0.29]. Age was the strongest predictor of effect size. The gender difference for diagnoses emerged earlier than previously thought, with OR = 2.37 at age 12. For both meta-analyses, the gender difference peaked in adolescence (OR = 3.02 for ages 13-15, and d = 0.47 for age 16) but then declined and remained stable in adulthood. Cross-national analyses indicated that larger gender differences were found in nations with greater gender equity, for major depression, but not depression symptoms. The gender difference in depression represents a health disparity, especially in adolescence, yet the magnitude of the difference indicates that depression in men should not be overlooked.

  "28432098": "Inhibitory effect of coumarin on syntrophic fatty acid oxidizing and methanogenic cultures and biogas reactor microbiomes Coumarins are widely found in plants as natural constituents having antimicrobial activity. When considering plants rich in coumarins for biogas production, adverse effects on microorganisms driving the anaerobic digestion process are expected. Furthermore, coumarin derivatives like warfarin, which are used as anti-coagulating medicine, are found in wastewater affecting its treatment. Coumarin as the structure common to all coumarins inhibits the anaerobic digestion process. However, details of this inhibition are still elusive. Here, we studied the impact of coumarin on acetogenesis and methanogenesis. First, coumarin was applied at four concentrations between 0.25 and 1 g L(-1) to pure cultures of the methanogens Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanospirillum hungatei leading to up to 25% less methane production. Acetate production of syntrophic propionate and butyrate degrading cultures of Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans and Syntrophomonas wolfei were inhibited by 72% at a coumarin concentration of 1 g L(-1) Coumarin also inhibited acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis in a complex biogas reactor microbiome. When a coumarin-adapted microbiome was used, acetogenesis and methanogenesis were not inhibited. According to amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and mcrA genes, the microbial communities of both microbiomes were similar though Methanoculleus was more and Methanobacterium was less abundant in the coumarin-adapted than in the non-adapted microbiome. Our results suggest that well-dosed feeding with coumarin -rich feedstocks to full-scale biogas reactors keeping the coumarin concentrations below 0.5 g L(-1) will allow adaptation to coumarins by structural and functional community reorganization and coumarin degradation .IMPORTANCE Coumarins from natural and anthropogenic sources have an inhibitory impact on the anaerobic digestion process. Here, we studied in detail the adverse effects of the model compound coumarin on acetogenesis and methanogenesis, which are two important steps of the anaerobic digestion process. Coumarin concentrations lower than 0.5 g L(-1) had only a minor impact. Even though similar inhibitory effects can be assumed for coumarin derivatives, little effects on the anaerobic treatment of wastewater are expected where concentrations of coumarin derivatives are lower than 0.5 g L(-1) However, when full scale reactors are fed with coumarin -rich feedstocks, the biogas processes might be inhibited. Hence, these feedstocks should be utilized in a well- dosed manner or after adaptation of the microbial community.",
  "27409644": "Pregnancy suppresses the daily rhythmicity of core body temperature and adipose metabolic gene expression in the mouse Maternal adaptations in lipid metabolism are crucial for pregnancy success due to the role of white adipose tissue as an energy store and the dynamic nature of energy needs across gestation. Because lipid metabolism is regulated by the rhythmic expression of clock genes, it was hypothesised that maternal metabolic adaptations involve changes in both adipose clock gene expression and the rhythmic expression of downstream metabolic genes. Maternal core body temperature (Tc) was investigated as a possible mechanism driving pregnancy -induced changes in clock gene expression. Gonadal adipose tissue and plasma were collected from C57Bl/6J mice before and on days 6, 10, 14 and 18 of pregnancy (term = d19) at 4 hourly intervals across a 24-h period. Adipose expression of clock genes and downstream metabolic genes were determined by RT-qPCR and Tc was measured by intraperitoneal temperature loggers. Adipose clock gene expression showed robust rhythmicity throughout pregnancy, but absolute levels varied substantially across gestation. Rhythmic expression of the metabolic genes Lipe, Pnpla2 and Lpl was clearly evident before pregnancy; however, this rhythmicity was lost with the onset of pregnancy. Tc rhythm was significantly altered by pregnancy with a 65% decrease in amplitude by term and a 0.61°C decrease in mesor between days 6 and 18. These changes in Tc, however, did not appear to be linked to adipose clock gene expression across pregnancy. Overall, our data show marked adaptations in the adipose clock in pregnancy, with an apparent decoupling of adipose clock and lipolytic / lipogenic gene rhythms from early in gestation.",

The unprecedented properties of such organic nanomaterials (in particular their large surface area) gained extensive attention for their potential use as organic pollutant sorbents. Sorption interactions can be very hazardous and useful at the same time. This work investigates the influence of halogenation by bromine and/or chlorine in dibenzo-p-dioxins on their sorption ability on the C60 fullerene surface. Halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PXDDs, where X = Br or Cl) are ever-present in the environment and accidently produced in many technological processes in only approximately known quantities. If all combinatorial Br and/or Cl dioxin substitution possibilities are present in the environment, the experimental characterization and investigation of sorbent effectiveness is more than difficult. In this work, we have developed a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model (R(2) = 0.998), predicting the adsorption energy [kcal/mol] for 1,701 PXDDs adsorbed on C60 (PXDD @ C60). Based on the QSPR model reported herein, we concluded that the lowest energy PXDD @ C60 complexes are those that the World Health Organization (WHO) considers to be less dangerous with respect to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) toxicity mechanism. Therefore, the effectiveness of fullerenes as sorbent agents may be underestimated as sorption could be less effective for toxic congeners than previously believed.",
  "27916455": "Phosphodiesterase 10A Inhibition Improves Cortico-Basal Ganglia Function in Huntington's Disease Models Huntington's disease (HD) symptoms are driven to a large extent by dysfunction of the basal ganglia circuitry. HD patients exhibit reduced striatal phoshodiesterase 10 (PDE10) levels. Using HD mouse models that exhibit reduced PDE10, we demonstrate the benefit of pharmacologic PDE10 inhibition to acutely correct basal ganglia circuitry deficits. PDE10 inhibition restored corticostriatal input and boosted cortically driven indirect pathway activity. Cyclic nucleotide signaling is impaired in HD models, and PDE10 loss may represent a homeostatic adaptation to maintain signaling. Elevation of both cAMP and cGMP by PDE10 inhibition was required for rescue. Phosphoproteomic profiling of striatum in response to PDE10 inhibition highlighted plausible neural substrates responsible for the improvement. Early chronic PDE10 inhibition in Q175 mice showed improvements beyond those seen with acute administration after symptom onset, including partial reversal of striatal deregulated transcripts and the prevention of the emergence of HD neurophysiological deficits.

A retrospective case study was conducted of the clinical and management course of 2 patients with progressive, treatment - refractory metastatic cancer who were treated with a single dose each (concomitantly) of the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, 1 mg/kg, and ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg. Nivolumab and ipilimumab. The clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy in suspected autoimmune encephalitis in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitor use. Autoantibody testing confirmed identification of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 patient. Withdrawal of immune checkpoint inhibitors and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, consisting of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate equivalent to 1000 mg of methylprednisolone for 5 days, 0.4 mg/kg/d of intravenous immunoglobulin for 5 days, and 2 doses of rituximab, 1000 mg, in 1 patient and oral prednisone, 60 mg/d, in the other patient, resulted in improved neurologic symptoms. Immune checkpoint inhibition may favor the development of immune responses against neuronal antigens, leading to autoimmune encephalitis. Early recognition and treatment of autoimmune encephalitis in patients receiving immune checkpoint blockade therapy will likely be essential for maximizing clinical recovery and minimizing the effect of drug-related toxic effects. The mechanisms by which immune checkpoint inhibition may contribute to autoimmune encephalitis require further study.",
  "28423032": "Complete study demonstrating the absence of rhabdovirus in a distinct Sf9 cell line A putative novel rhabdovirus (SfRV) was previously identified in a Spodoptera frugiperda cell line (Sf9 cells [ATCC CRL-1711 lot 58078522]) by next generation sequencing and extensive bioinformatic analysis. We performed an extensive analysis of our Sf9 cell bank (ATCC CRL-1711 lot 5814 [Sf9L5814]) to determine whether this virus was already present in cells obtained from ATCC in 1987. Inverse PCR of DNA isolated from Sf9 L5814 cellular DNA revealed integration of SfRV sequences in the cellular genome. RT-PCR of total RNA showed a deletion of 320 nucleotides in the SfRV RNA that includes the transcriptional motifs for genes X and L. Concentrated cell culture supernatant was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and revealed a single band at a density of 1.14 g/ml. This fraction was further analysed by electron microscopy and showed amorphous and particulate debris that did not resemble a rhabdovirus in morphology or size. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the protein composition did not contain the typical five rhabdovirus structural proteins and LC-MS/MS analysis revealed primarily of exosomal marker proteins, the SfRV N protein, and truncated forms of SfRV N, P, and G proteins. The SfRV L gene fragment RNA sequence was recovered from the supernatant after ultracentrifugation of the 1.14 g/ml fraction treated with diethyl ether suggesting that the SfRV L gene fragment sequence is not associated with a diethyl ether resistant nucleocapsid. Interestingly, the 1.14 g/ml fraction was able to transfer baculovirus DNA into Sf9L5814 cells, consistent with the presence of functional exosomes. Our results demonstrate the absence of viral particles in ATCC CRL-1711 lot 5814 Sf9 cells in contrast to a previous study that suggested the presence of infectious rhabdoviral particles in Sf9 cells from a different lot. This study highlights how cell lines with different lineages may present different virosomes and therefore no general conclusions can be drawn across Sf9 cells from different laboratories.",

The aim of this analysis was to determine interobserver and intraobserver reliability of commonly used clinical tests in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). We studied subjects with symptomatic knee OA who were participants in an open-label clinical trial of intraarticular steroid therapy. Following standardization of the clinical test procedures, 2 clinicians assessed 25 subjects independently at the same visit, and the same clinician assessed 88 subjects over an interval period of 2-10 weeks; in both cases prior to the steroid intervention. Clinical examination included assessment of bony enlargement, crepitus, quadriceps wasting, knee effusion, joint-line and anserine tenderness, and knee range of movement (ROM). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), estimated kappa (κ), weighted kappa (κω), and Bland-Altman plots were used to determine interobserver and intraobserver levels of agreement. Using Landis and Koch criteria, interobserver κ scores were moderate for patellofemoral joint (κ = 0.53) and anserine tenderness (κ = 0.48); good for bony enlargement (κ = 0.66), quadriceps wasting (κ = 0.78), crepitus (κ = 0.78), medial tibiofemoral joint tenderness (κ = 0.76), and effusion assessed by ballottement (κ = 0.73) and bulge sign (κω = 0.78); and excellent for lateral tibiofemoral joint tenderness (κ = 1.00), flexion (ICC = 0.97), and extension (ICC = 0.87) ROM. Intraobserver κ scores were moderate for lateral tibiofemoral joint tenderness (κ = 0.60); good for crepitus (κ = 0.78), effusion assessed by ballottement test (κ = 0.77), patellofemoral joint (κ = 0.66), medial tibiofemoral joint (κ = 0.64), and anserine tenderness (κ = 0.73); and excellent for effusion assessed by bulge sign (κω = 0.83), bony enlargement (κ = 0.98), quadriceps wasting (κ = 0.83), flexion (ICC = 0.99), and extension (ICC = 0.96) ROM. Among individuals with symptomatic knee OA, the reliability of clinical examination of the knee was at least good for the majority of clinical signs of knee OA.",

Prevalence was higher with age, lower bone mineral density (BMD), and in those meeting criteria for spine imaging. Most subjects with spine fractures were unaware of them. Spine fractures have substantial medical significance but are seldom recognized. This study collected contemporary nationally representative spine fracture prevalence data. Cross-sectional analysis of 3330 US adults aged ≥40 years participating in NHANES 2013-2014 with evaluable Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA). VFA was graded by semiquantitative measurement. BMD and an osteoporosis questionnaire were collected. Overall spine fracture prevalence was 5.4 % and similar in men and women. Prevalence increased with age from <5 % in those <60 to 11 % in those 70-79 and 18 % in those ≥80 years. Fractures were more common in non-Hispanic whites and in people with lower body mass index and BMD. Among subjects with spine fracture, 26 % met BMD criteria for osteoporosis. Prevalence was higher in subjects who met National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) criteria for spine imaging (14 vs 4.7 %, P < 0.001). Only 8 % of people with a spine fracture diagnosed by VFA had a self-reported fracture, and among those who self-reported a spine fracture, only 21 % were diagnosed with fracture by VFA. Spine fracture prevalence is similar in women and men and increases with age and lower BMD, although most subjects with spine fracture do not meet BMD criteria for osteoporosis. Since most (>90 %) individuals were unaware of their spine fractures, lateral spine imaging is needed to identify these women and men. Spine fracture prevalence was threefold higher in individuals meeting NOF criteria for spine imaging (∼1 in 7 undergoing VFA). Identifying spine fractures as part of comprehensive risk assessment may improve clinical decision making.",
  "27812586": "Large-scale synthesis and structural analysis of a synthetic glycopeptide dendrimer as an anti-cancer vaccine candidate Herein, we report a new process that enables the gram-scale production of a fully synthetic anti-cancer vaccine for human use. This therapeutic vaccine candidate, named MAG-Tn3, is a high-molecular-weight tetrameric glycopeptide encompassing carbohydrate tumor-associated Tn antigen clusters and peptidic CD4(+) T-cell epitopes. The synthetic process involves (i) the stepwise solid-phase assembly of protected amino acids, including the high value-added Tn building blocks with only 1.5 equivalents, (ii) a single isolated intermediate, and (iii) the simultaneous deprotection of 36 hindered protective groups. The resulting MAG-Tn3 was unambiguously characterized using a combination of techniques, including a structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The four peptidic chains are flexible in solution, with a more constrained but extended conformation at the Tn3 antigen motif. Finally, we demonstrate that, when injected into HLA-DR1 - expressing transgenic mice, this vaccine induces Tn-specific antibodies that mediate the killing of human Tn-positive tumor cells. These studies led to a clinical batch of the MAG-Tn3, currently investigated in breast cancer patients (phase I clinical trial). The current study demonstrates the feasibility of the multigram-scale synthesis of a highly pure complex glycopeptide, and it opens new avenues for the use of synthetic glycopeptides as drugs in humans.",

Given the role of the gut microbiota in regulating host metabolism, we explored the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on the modifications of gut microbiota with regard to the potential influence of food intake and/or weight loss and examined their links with host metabolism. Zucker diabetic fatty rats were divided into the following groups: RYGB; sham-operated with pair-fed as RYGB; sham-operated fed ad libitum; and SG. The metabolic effects and gut microbiota profile were analyzed 10 weeks postoperatively. Associations between discriminating genera and metabolic markers after RYGB were explored. The 2 procedures induced similar glucose improvement and increased flora diversity after 10 weeks compared with sham-operated groups. RYGB induced a marked higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria / Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria and increased emergence of Fusobacteria and Clostridium, whereas SG resulted in more abundant Actinobacteria compared with other groups. Most of the 12 discriminant genera correlated with changes in metabolic phenotype, but only 28.6% of these correlations were independent of weight, and 4 discriminant genera still negatively correlated with serum insulin level independent of food intake and weight loss after RYGB. These data demonstrate that RYGB and SG surgery produced similar diversity but different microbiota compositions changes in Zucker diabetic fatty rats. These findings stimulate deeper explorations of functions of the discriminate microbiota and the mechanisms linking postsurgical modulation of gut microbiota and improvements in insulin resistance.",
  "28388318": "Rotary and High - Pressure Nozzle Spray Plume Droplet Analysis For Aerially Applied Mosquito Adulticides: Laser Diffraction Characterization The droplet spectrum of a mosquito adulticide spray plume determines its ability to drift through the target area, impinge on the mosquito, deliver a toxic dose, and the risk of environmental contamination. This paper provides data on droplet spectra produced from 6 nozzles in a high - pressure nozzle spray system and 5 rotary nozzle systems for common mosquito adulticides. Spray plume spectra were measured by laser diffraction. High - pressure nozzles were evaluated at pressure s ranging from 500 psi to 6,000 psi. Rotary nozzles were evaluated at rotational speeds ranging from 500 rpm to 24,000 rpm. Measurements were made at wind speeds of 129 km/h (80 mph) to 225 km/h (140 mph). Adulticides included were Fyfanon (®), Aqua-Reslin (®), Dibrom (®), Duet (®), Permanone (®), and the inert mineral oil, Orchex(®) 796. High- pressure nozzles produced spray plumes within the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) label requirements for all configurations tested except for one at a wind speed of 225 km/h, BETE(®) MW125. Air speed had no significant effect on the spray plume volume median diameter (Dv (0.5)) at the speeds tested with Fyfanon (®). The spray plume 90% drop volume diameter (Dv (0.9)) significantly decreased, 13% at the higher wind speed of 225 km/h. Drop size was inversely related to pressure. Dilution of the product formulations increased the Dv (0.5) of the spray plume but it did not exceed the label requirements. For the PJ15 nozzle, orientation of the nozzle into the wind of up to 135° showed a significant increase in Dv (0.5) at 500 psi, 750 psi, and 1,500 psi. The Dv (0.5) varied <5 μm over the 3 angles examined for any specific pressure. Rotary nozzles produced spray plumes within the EPA label requirements for all test configurations examined. Air speed had no significant effect on Dv (0.5) or Dv (0.9) of the plume at speeds tested with Fyfanon for the ASC A20 nozzle. The rotary AU5000 nozzle using Orchex 796 produced plumes of larger drops in all configurations than any of the rotary nozzles of similar configurations using active ingredient formulations and within EPA label requirements.",

We show how the underlying dynamics of these experiences are different across these disorders. We argue that these concepts are complex and cannot be reduced to neural mechanisms, but involve embodied and situated processes that include the physical and social environments. We conclude by arguing that the subjective and intersubjective dimensions of agency and ownership cannot be considered in isolation from one another, but instead form an interdependent pairing.",
  "28186107": "Blubber transcriptome response to acute stress axis activation involves transient changes in adipogenesis and lipolysis in a fasting -adapted marine mammal Stress can compromise an animal's ability to conserve metabolic stores and participate in energy -demanding activities that are critical for fitness. Understanding how wild animals, especially those already experiencing physiological extremes (e.g. fasting), regulate stress responses is critical for evaluating the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on physiology and fitness, key challenges for conservation. However, studies of stress in wildlife are often limited to baseline endocrine measurements and few have investigated stress effects in fasting -adapted species. We examined downstream molecular consequences of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation by exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in blubber of northern elephant seals due to the ease of blubber sampling and its key role in metabolic regulation in marine mammals. We report the first phocid blubber transcriptome produced by RNAseq, containing over 140,000 annotated transcripts, including metabolic and adipocytokine genes of interest. The acute response of blubber to stress axis activation, measured 2 hours after ACTH administration, involved highly specific, transient (lasting <24 hours) induction of gene networks that promote lipolysis and adipogenesis in mammalian adipocytes. Differentially expressed genes included key adipogenesis factors which can be used as blubber -specific markers of acute stress in marine mammals of concern for which sampling of other tissues is not possible.",
  "27301681": "Sequence-specific DNA binding by long hairpin pyrrole-imidazole polyamides containing an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid unit With the aim of improving aqueous solubility, we designed and synthesized five N-methylpyrrole (Py)-N-methylimidazole (Im) polyamides capable of recognizing 9-bp sequences. Their DNA-binding affinities and sequence specificities were evaluated by SPR and Bind-n-Seq analyses. The design of polyamide 1 was based on a conventional model, with three consecutive Py or Im rings separated by a β-alanine to match the curvature and twist of long DNA helices. Polyamides 2 and 3 contained an 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (AO) unit, which has previously only been used as a linker within linear Py-Im polyamides or between Py - Im hairpin motifs for tandem hairpin. It is demonstrated herein that AO also functions as a linker element that can extend to 2-bp in hairpin motifs. Notably, although the AO -containing unit can fail to bind the expected sequence, polyamide 4, which has two AO units facing each other in a hairpin form, successfully showed the expected motif and a KD value of 16nM was recorded. Polyamide 5, containing a β-alanine-β-alanine unit instead of the AO of polyamide 2, was synthesized for comparison. The aqueous solubilities and nuclear localization of three of the polyamides were also examined. The results suggest the possibility of applying the AO unit in the core of Py-Im polyamide compounds.",

  "27555752": "Modeling the hospital safety partnership preferences of patients and their families: a discrete choice conjoint experiment Patients and their families play an important role in efforts to improve health service safety. The objective of this study is to understand the safety partnership preferences of patients and their families. We used a discrete choice conjoint experiment to model the safety partnership preferences of 1,084 patients or those such as parents acting on their behalf. Participants made choices between hypothetical safety partnerships composed by experimentally varying 15 four-level partnership design attributes. Participants preferred an approach to safety based on partnerships between patients and staff rather than a model delegating responsibility for safety to hospital staff. They valued the opportunity to participate in point of service safety partnerships, such as identity and medication double checks, that might afford an immediate risk reduction. Latent class analysis yielded two segments. Actively engaged participants (73.3%) comprised outpatients with higher education, who anticipated more benefits to safety partnerships, were more confident in their ability to contribute, and were more intent on participating. They were more likely to prefer a personal engagement strategy, valued scientific evidence, preferred a more active approach to safety education, and advocated disclosure of errors. The passively engaged segment (26.7%) anticipated fewer benefits, were less confident in their ability to contribute, and were less intent on participating. They were more likely to prefer an engagement strategy based on signage. They preferred that staff explain why they thought patients should help make care safer and decide whether errors were disclosed. Inpatients, those with immigrant backgrounds, and those with less education were more likely to be in this segment. Health services need to communicate information regarding risks, ask about partnership preferences, create opportunities respecting individual differences, and ensure a positive response when patients raise safety concerns.",
  "27989819": "Detachment of the fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding protein (FCP) antenna is not involved in the acclimative regulation of photoprotection in the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum When grown under intermittent light (IL), the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum forms 'super' non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) in response to excess light. The current model of diatom NPQ mechanism involves two quenching sites, one of which detaches from photosystem II reaction centres (RCIIs) and aggregates into oligomeric complexes. Here we addressed how antenna reorganisation controls NPQ kinetics in P. tricornutum cells grown under continuous light (CL) and IL. Overall, IL acclimation induced: (i) reorganisation of chloroplasts, containing greater pigment pools without a strongly enhanced operation of the xanthophyll cycle, and (ii) ' super NPQ ' causing a remarkable reduction of the chlorophyll excited state lifetime at Fm '. Regardless of different levels of NPQ formed in both culture conditions, its dark recovery was rapid and similar fractions of their antenna uncoupled (~50%). Although antenna detachment relieved excitation pressure, it provided a minor protective contribution equivalent to NPQ ~1, while the largest NPQ was 4.4±0.2 (CL) and 13±0.8 (IL). The PSII cross-section decrease took place only at relatively low NPQ values, beyond which the cross-section remained constant whilst NPQ continued to rise. This finding suggests that the energy trapping efficiency of diatom antenna quenchers cannot over-compete that of RCIIs, similarly to what has been observed on higher plants. We conclude that such ' economic photoprotection ' operates to flexibly adjust the overall efficiency of diatom light harvesting.",
  "28070679": "Diversity of Microbial Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZYmes) Associated with Freshwater and Soil Samples from Caatinga Biome Semi-arid and arid areas occupy about 33% of terrestrial ecosystems. However, little information is available about microbial diversity in the semi-arid Caatinga, which represents a unique biome that extends to about 11% of the Brazilian territory and is home to extraordinary diversity and high endemism level of species. In this study, we characterized the diversity of microbial genes associated with biomass conversion (carbohydrate-active enzymes, or so-called CAZYmes) in soil and freshwater of the Caatinga. Our results showed distinct CAZYme profiles in the soil and freshwater samples. Glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases were the most abundant CAZYme families, with glycoside hydrolases more dominant in soil (∼44%) and glycosyltransferases more abundant in freshwater (∼50%). The abundances of individual glycoside hydrolase, glycosyltransferase, and carbohydrate-binding module subfamilies varied widely between soil and water samples. A predominance of glycoside hydrolases was observed in soil, and a higher contribution of enzymes involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis was observed in freshwater. The main taxa associated with the CAZYme sequences were Planctomycetia (relative abundance in soil, 29%) and Alphaproteobacteria (relative abundance in freshwater, 27%). Approximately 5-7% of CAZYme sequences showed low similarity with sequences deposited in non-redundant databases, suggesting putative homologues. Our findings represent a first attempt to describe specific microbial CAZYme profiles for environmental samples. Characterizing these enzyme groups associated with the conversion of carbohydrates in nature will improve our understanding of the significant roles of enzymes in the carbon cycle. We identified a CAZYme signature that can be used to discriminate between soil and freshwater samples, and this signature may be related to the microbial species adapted to the habitat. The data show the potential ecological roles of the CAZYme repertoire and associated biotechnological applications.",

Whole slide images were obtained for colonic normal mucosa (NCM), hyperplastic polyps (HP), conventional tubular adenomas (TA), and adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and esophageal intestinal metaplasia negative for dysplasia (IM), indefinite for dysplasia (IFD), low-grade dysplasia (LGD), and HGD. Characteristic nuclei were circumscribed, and parameters discriminating groups included nuclear circumference (μm), area (μm(2)), and 15 positive pixel count (PPC) algorithm IA measurements. In colon polyps and esophageal lesions, average nuclear area and circumference ranged 30-108.6 μm(2) and 27.5-48.9 μm, respectively. Differences for average nuclear area and circumference met statistical significance (p < 0.05) between diagnostic groups in the esophagus and colon, except for IM versus IFD nuclear area. Pixel intensity (brightness) separated lesions within both groups with statistical significance except for colonic TAs versus HPs and esophageal LGD versus IM. HGD nuclei in both groups demonstrated more pixel staining heterogeneity than other lesions. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis demonstrated that lesions with similar diagnoses tended to cluster together on a low- to high-grade spectrum. Our results confirm that quantitative IA is an effective adjunct reflecting dysplasia in colon polyps and Barrett esophagus lesions. Nuclear area, circumference, and PPC algorithm findings distinguished lesions in a statistically significant manner. This suggests utility for future studies on similar methods, which may provide an adjunctive ancillary technique for pathologists and enhance patient care.",

However, in many centers, because of cost - constraints, these devices are reused multiple times. We studied microbiological contamination and bioburden on reprocessed needles to evaluate whether these devices can be successfully sterilized. We studied 10 EUS needles each of 19 G, 22 G, and 25 G in size, and five 22-G ProCore needles. After initial use, each needle was reprocessed by a standardized protocol. We used standard microbiological cultures, as well as ATP bioluminescence technique to quantify bioburden as relative light units (RLU). We defined significant soil contamination by RLU values >200. We also used extractant fluid to disrupt cell membranes in an attempt to enhance ATP detection. We found culture positivity in 3/34 (8.8%), and detectable bioburden on the exposed surface of 33/35 (94.3%), and inside lumen of 29 (82.9%) reprocessed FNA needles. Significant bioburden was found in three (8.6%) and two (5.7%) needles on the surface and lumen, respectively. We found that use of extractant fluid enhanced detection of bioburden. Larger (19 G) needles had higher surface contamination (P = 0.016), but there was no relation of luminal contamination with needle diameter (P = 0.138). Sheath design and presence of side bevel did not influence extent of contamination. There was significant correlation between the surface and intraluminal bioburden (P < 0.001). There is significant bioburden in reprocessed EUS needles; standard microbiological cultures have low sensitivity for detection of needle contamination. We have provided objective evidence for the futility of reprocessing attempts, and practice of EUS needle reuse should be discontinued.",

  "28237953": "Evaluating the relative effectiveness of high-intensity and low-intensity models of behaviour change communication interventions for abortion care-seeking in Bihar and Jharkhand, India: a cross-sectional study This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a high-intensity model (HIM) and a low-intensity model (LIM) of behaviour change communication interventions in Bihar and Jharkhand states of India designed to improve women's knowledge and usage of safe abortion services, as well as the dose effect of intervention exposure. We conducted two cross-sectional household surveys among married women aged 15-49 years in intervention and comparison districts. Difference-in-difference models were used to assess the efficacy of the intervention, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Although both intervention types improved abortion knowledge, the HIM intervention was more effective in improving comprehensive knowledge about abortion. In particular, there were improvements in knowledge on legality of abortion (AOR=2.2; 95% CI 1.6 to 2.9) and nearby sources of safe abortion care (AOR=1.7; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.3). Higher level of exposure to abortion-related messages was related to more accurate knowledge about abortion within both intervention groups. Evidence was mixed on changes in abortion care-seeking behaviour. More work is needed to ensure that women seek safe abortion services in lieu of informal services that may be more likely to lead to postabortion complications.",
  "27938482": "Repetitive and Prolonged Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment After Traumatic Brain Injury Enhances Long-Term Tissue Restoration and Cognitive Recovery Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most disabling clinical conditions that could lead to neurocognitive disorders in survivors. Our group and others previously reported that prophylactic enrichment of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) markedly ameliorate cognitive deficits after TBI. However, it remains unclear whether a clinically relevant therapeutic regimen with n-3 PUFAs administered after TBI would still offer significant improvement of long-term cognitive recovery. In the present study, we employed the decline of spatial cognitive function as a main outcome after TBI to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of post - TBI n-3 PUFA treatment and the underlying mechanisms. Mice were subjected to sham operation or controlled cortical impact, followed by random assignment to receive the following four treatments: (1) vehicle control; (2) daily intraperitoneal injections of n-3 PUFAs for 2 weeks, beginning 2 h after TBI; (3) fish oil dietary supplementation throughout the study, beginning 1 day after TBI; or (4) combination of treatments (2) and (3). Spatial cognitive deficits and chronic brain tissue loss, as well as endogenous brain repair processes such as neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis, were evaluated up to 35 days after TBI. The results revealed prominent spatial cognitive deficits and massive tissue loss caused by TBI. Among all mice receiving post-TBI n-3 PUFA treatments, the combined treatment of fish oil dietary supplement and n-3 PUFA injections demonstrated a reproducible beneficial effect in attenuating cognitive deficits although without reducing gross tissue loss. Mechanistically, the combined treatment promoted post-TBI restorative processes in the brain, including generation of immature neurons, microvessels, and oligodendrocytes, each of which was significantly correlated with the improved cognitive recovery. These results indicated that repetitive and prolonged n-3 PUFA treatments after TBI are capable of enhancing brain remodeling and could be developed as a potential therapy to treat TBI victims in the clinic.",

In the current study, we collected observational data to investigate predictors of the quality of grandmother - grandchild interactions in Zambia. Data were collected from 46 grandmothers and their 12 to 27- month -old infant grandchildren. The results revealed that grandmothers with fewer children and those who enjoyed the grandparenting tasks more were more sensitive in their interactions with their grandchildren. Unexpectedly, parenting beliefs favoring sensitive parenting predicted lower observed sensitivity in grandmothers. Further, grandmothers with a more individualistic cultural orientation were more intrusive toward their grandchildren. The results underscore the importance of time and emotional resources as predictors of sensitive parenting among grandmothers.",

In order to control the incorporation of these CNT channels into lipid bilayers, it is important to understand the structure of the CNTPs before and after insertion into the lipid bilayer as well as the impact of such insertion on the bilayer structure. Here we employed a noninvasive in situ probe, small-angle X-ray scattering, to study the integration of CNT porins into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers. Our results show that CNTPs in solution are stabilized by a monolayer of lipid molecules wrapped around their outer surface. We also demonstrate that insertion of CNTPs into the lipid bilayer results in decreased bilayer thickness with the magnitude of this effect increasing with the concentration of CNTPs.",

As a remarkable clue and as early as 1986, ultrasonography (US) has been proven a reliable diagnostic method that is also explicitly helpful in difficult cases with atypical presentation and enables to rule out many differential diagnoses .Recent publications emphasized the role of multidetector computed tomography (CT) resulting in a significant reduction of false negative findings at operation. Extensive as well as uncritical application of this method even in children inevitably causes substantial radiation exposure, a sequel to either pure ignorance or unqualified/ inadequate performance of US in this particular situation, which in turn can be considered sequel to either egocentric or economic preponderance .Recent data shed new light on the role of US (and CT) in acute appendicitis. Therefore, 1 generation after US with graded compression was etched in stone as the method of choice for diagnosing acute appendicitis (Puylaert), a visual arousal fostering its role and performance in clinical medicine appears justified.",

To evaluate atopy patch tests (APTs) and skin prick tests (SPTs) in children with atopic dermatitis, using allergen extracts from locally lyophilized foods (cow's milk, egg white, egg yolk, wheat, soy, and shrimp), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, and American cockroach. This study was a prospective, self-controlled study in children with atopic dermatitis. APTs, SPTs, and oral food challenge tests were performed in the cases with written informed consent. Fifty-six children with atopic dermatitis were enrolled. According to the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis Index, moderate atopic dermatitis was the most common severity (49.1%) followed by mild (20%) and severe atopic dermatitis (13.2%). APT results were positive for food allergens in 49% of participants; SPT results were positive in 54.7%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of APTs for foods were 40%, 90.2%, 65.2%, and 76.6%, respectively.

They stated that venous thromboembolism (VTE) had been seen in 21 (4.6%) of their patients. This is an important issue because VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is the most common overall complication in meningioma surgery and is fatal in up to one third of patients (2). We suppose that prophylaxis of VTE is most effective when mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis are combined. We consider that there key some practical questions to be answered for a proper clinical extrapolation.",
  "27665550": "Unconventional Protein Secretion in Plants Unconventional protein secretion (UPS) describes secretion pathways that bypass one or several of the canonical secretion pit-stops on the way to the plasma membrane, and/or involve the secretion of leaderless proteins. So far, alternatives to conventional secretion were primarily observed and studied in yeast and animal cells. The sessile lifestyle of plants brings with it unique restraints on how they adapt to adverse conditions and environmental challenges. Recently, attention towards unconventional secretion pathways in plant cells has substantially increased, with the large number of leaderless proteins identified through proteomic studies. While UPS pathways in plants are certainly not yet exhaustively researched, an emerging notion is that induction of UPS pathways is correlated with pathogenesis and stress responses. Given the multitude UPS events observed, comprehensively organizing the routes proteins take to the apoplast in defined UPS categories is challenging. With the establishment of a larger collection of studied plant proteins taking these UPS pathways, a clearer picture of endomembrane trafficking as a whole will emerge. There are several novel enabling technologies, such as vesicle proteomics and chemical genomics, with great potential for dissecting secretion pathways, providing information about the cargo that travels along them and the conditions that induce them.",

The present meta-analysis aims to determine whether the resuscitative phase really takes advantages by being performed with EGDT. A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of EGDT versus usual care in patients with early septic shock was performed. Four high- quality RCTs have been included with 4,464 patients (1990 in EGDT and 2013 in usual care arm). ICU admission and cardiovascular support necessity increased in the EGDT group (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.55-2.57 and OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.08-1.64, respectively). EGDT has no significant effect on mortality (90 days, 60 days, 28 days, and mortality by the time of hospital discharge). EGDT has no significant effect in reducing the length of hospital stay, the necessity of respiratory and renal function support, and the duration of respiratory and cardiocirculatory support.

  "27623945": "Hint1 suppresses migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro by modulating girdin activity Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (Hint1) is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene. Its role in cancer cell migration has not been previously speculated. In the current study, we examined the expression of Hint1 in metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and further elucidated the effect of Hint1 expression on girdin expression and phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1 / 2 and on the migration of HCC cells in vitro. Expression of Hint1 and girdin in primary HCC tissues and metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes was determined by RT-PCR assays. HepG2 cells were transfected with plasmid vectors overexpressing Hint1 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Hint1, girdin, Hint1 plus girdin, or the scrambled RNA. Migration and invasion of HCC cells were examined by wound and Transwell assays. Protein expression was detected by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting assays. RT-PCR assays revealed that the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels of Hint1 were markedly lower than those of primary HCC tissues and non-metastatic lymph nodes (P < 0.01). By contrast, the mRNA transcript levels of girdin were significantly higher than non-metastatic lymph nodes (P < 0.05). Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of HINT1 resulted in a significant increase in the mRNA transcript levels of girdin in HepG2 cells (P < 0.05). Wound assays and Transwell assays showed that Hint1 knockdown by siRNA significantly enhanced the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells compared to HepG2 cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. Hint1 knockdown also led to significantly increased phosphorylation of girdin and AKT in HepG2 cells (P < 0.05), which, however, was effectively aborted by girdin knockdown by siRNA (P < 0.05). Hint1 is downregulated in metastatic lymph nodes and is implicated in migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro by modulating girdin and AKT expression and phosphorylation. The Hint1 - girdin - AKT signaling axis should be further dissected for its role in HCC migration and invasion and may be therapeutically targeted to suppress tumor growth and metastasis.",

This report is even more unusual since the pathogen isolated was the invasive and virulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3. The clinical entity described is also called Austrian syndrome. Even though rare in this antibiotic era, the syndrome remains one of high morbidity and mortality. This particular case is of paramount importance for the clinician reader. First, it documents the clinical features associated with invasive pneumococcal disease and the Austrian syndrome. Second, and equally important, it highlights why following the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines saves lives. For this case, the following steps were taken: 1. As a surrogate for perfusion, early and aggressive fluid resuscitation therapy (guided by lactic acid levels) was instituted; 2. also early in the treatment, broad spectrum antibiotics were administered; 3. to guide antibiotic therapy, microbiological cultures were obtained. The patient subsequently improved and was transferred to the internal medicine ward to complete 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy.",
  "28220061": "A Model of Induction of Cerebellar Long-Term Depression Including RKIP Inactivation of Raf and MEK We report an updated stochastic model of cerebellar Long Term Depression (LTD) with improved realism. Firstly, we verify experimentally that dissociation of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) from Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) is required for cerebellar LTD and add this interaction to an earlier published model, along with the known requirement of dissociation of RKIP from Raf kinase. We update Ca(2+) dynamics as a constant-rate influx, which captures experimental input profiles accurately. We improve α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4 isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor interactions by adding phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors when bound to glutamate receptor interacting protein (GRIP). The updated model is tuned to reproduce experimental Ca(2+) peak vs. LTD amplitude curves at four different Ca(2+) pulse durations as closely as possible. We find that the updated model is generally more robust with these changes, yet we still observe some sensitivity of LTD induction to copy number of the key signaling molecule Protein kinase C (PKC). We predict natural variability in this number by stochastic diffusion may influence the probabilistic LTD response to Ca(2+) input in Purkinje cell spines and propose this as an extra source of stochasticity that may be important also in other signaling systems.",

The model was tested using a large array of both existing and newly designed compounds. Pulmonary absorption data was generated using the isolated perfused respiring rat lung (IPRLu) model for 82 drug discovery compounds and 17 marketed drugs. This dataset was used to build a novel QSAR model based on calculated physicochemical properties. A further 9 compounds were used to test the model's predictive capability. The QSAR model performed well on the 9 compounds in the \" Test set \" with a predicted versus observed correlation of R(2) = 0.85, and >65% of compounds correctly categorised. Calculated descriptors associated with permeability and hydrophobicity positively correlated with pulmonary absorption, whereas those associated with charge, ionisation and size negatively correlated. The novel QSAR model described here can replace routine generation of IPRLu model data for ranking and classifying compounds prior to synthesis. It will also provide scientists working in the field of inhaled drug discovery with a deeper understanding of the physicochemical drivers of pulmonary absorption based on a relevant respiratory compound dataset.",

Identification of molecular mechanisms in adipogenic differentiation pathway might lead to development of new strategies for diagnosis, prevention and therapy of obesity and associated diseases. Discovery of new genes and proteins in the differentiation pathway could help to understand the key specific regulators of the adipogenesis. Cytoglobin (Cygb), identified as a new globin family member protein, is expressed in various tissues. Although its interaction with oxygen and nitric oxide indicates the potential role in antioxidant pathways, the exact role remains unclear. In the current study, expression level of Cygb was determined in proliferating and differentiating 3T3-F442A cells by gene expression and protein expression analysis. Results revealed that Cygb expression up-regulated in differentiated cells in parallel with adipogenic differentiation markers; PPARγ, CEBPα and FABP4 expressions. Besides, Cygb overexpression in preadipocytes contributed to the adipogenic differentiation as verified by detection of higher lipid droplets and increased PPARγ, CEBPα and FABP4 expressions with respect to control cells. These findings will shed light on the unknown roles of Cygb in adipogenesis and obesity.",

There is few data regarding this issue in the literature. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between HRQoL and gender, functional parameters and history of hospitalizations in patients with AATD. This is a cross-sectional study of 26 patients with severe AATD recruited in the pulmonology outpatient clinic at a tertiary care medical center. Social-demographic, clinical and functional parameters were recorded and HRQoL was assessed with the Portuguese version of the medical outcome study short form-36 (SF-36) self-administered questionnaire. Older patients, females and patients with at least one hospitalization in the previous year due to respiratory disease had statistical lower scores in some dimensions of the SF-36 questionnaire. Superior FEV1 and higher distance mark in the 6-min walking test distance influenced positively several dimensions of the questionnaire. Higher scores in the mMRC scale influenced negatively the HRQoL. These data suggests that older and female patients with AATD have worse HRQoL. Hospitalizations and functional markers of respiratory disease progression influenced negatively the HRQoL, suggesting that the SF-36 questionnaire could be useful as an outcome for AATD patients with lung involvement.",

MRI exams were performed on two 3 Tesla Philips Ingenia systems using 32 channel head coil arrays. After local institutional review board approval, the 3D spiral-based pCASL technique was added to a standard brain MRI exam and evaluated in 13 pediatric patients (average age: 11.7±6.4years, range: 1.4-22.2years). All patients were administered ACZ for clinically indicated reasons. Quantitative whole-brain CBF measurements were computed pre - and post - ACZ to assess cerebrovascular reserve. 3D spiral pCASL data were successfully reconstructed in all 13 cases. In 11 patients, CBF increased 2.8% to 93.2% after administration of ACZ. In the two remaining patients, CBF decreased by 2.4 to 6.0% after ACZ. The group average change in CBF due to ACZ was approximately 25.0% and individual changes were statistically significant (p<0.01) in all patients using a paired t-test analysis. CBF perfusion data were diagnostically useful in supporting conventional MR angiography and clinical findings. 3D cylindrically-distributed spiral pCASL MRI provides a robust approach to assess cerebral blood flow and reserve in pediatric patients.",

Women with resectable breast cancer from 1990 to 2007 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (n = 199,963) were analyzed. The outcome events of breast cancer were classified as breast cancer-specific death (BCSD), non-BCSD, or survival. Binary logistics was used to estimate the occurrence rates of non-BCSD and BCSD with different clinicopathological factors. The Gray method was used to measure the cumulative incidence of non-BCSD and BCSD. The ratio of non-BCSDs to all causes of death and stacked cumulative incidence function plots were used to present the impact of non-BCSD on overall survival (OS). Models of Cox proportional hazards regression and competing risk regression were compared to highlight the suitable model. There were 12,879 non-BCSDs (6.44%) and 28,784 BCSDs (14.39%). The oldest age group (>62 years), black race, and a single or divorced marital status were associated with more non-BCSDs. With adjustments for age, a hormone receptor-positive (HoR+) status was no longer related to increased non-BCSD s. In patients with grade 1, stage I disease and an HoR+ status as well as the oldest subgroup, a great dilution of non-BCSD on all causes of death could be observed, and this led to incorrect interpretations. The inaccuracy, caused by the commonly used Cox proportional hazards model, could be corrected by a competing risk model. OS was largely impaired by non-BCSD during early breast cancer. For some future clinical trial planning, especially for the oldest patients and those with HoR+ breast cancer, non-BCSD should be considered a competing risk event.

Placental infections can cause several adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB). Yet, we have limited knowledge regarding the mechanisms the placenta uses to control infections. Here, we show that autophagy, a cellular recycling pathway important for host defense against pathogens, and the autophagy gene Atg16L1 play a key role in placental defense and are negatively associated with PTB in pregnant women. First, we demonstrate that placentas from women who delivered preterm exhibit reduced autophagy activity and are associated with higher infection indicators. Second, we identify the cellular location of the autophagy activity as being in syncytial trophoblasts. Third, we demonstrate that higher levels of autophagy and ATG16L1 in human trophoblasts were associated with increased resistance to infection. Accordingly, loss of autophagy or ATG16L1 impaired trophoblast antibacterial defenses. Fourth, we show that Atg16l1 - deficient mice gave birth prematurely upon an inflammatory stimulus and their placentas were significantly less able to withstand infection. Finally, global induction of autophagy in both mouse placentas and human trophoblasts increased infection resistance. Our study has significant implications for understanding the etiology of placental infections and prematurity and developing strategies to mitigate placental infection - induced PTB.",

Primary production ((14)C - incorporation) and group-specific growth and net growth rates (two-treatment seawater dilution method) were estimated from samples incubated in situ at eight depths. Our cruise coincided with a mild El Niño event, and only weak upwelling was observed in the CRD. Nevertheless, the highest phytoplankton abundances were found near the dome center. However, mixed-layer growth rates were lowest in the dome center (∼0.5-0.9 day(-1)), but higher on the edge of the dome (∼0.9-1.0 day(-1)) and in adjacent coastal waters (0.9-1.3 day(-1)). We found good agreement between independent methods to estimate growth rates. Mixed-layer growth rates of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were largely balanced by mortality, whereas eukaryotic phytoplankton showed positive net growth (∼0.5-0.6 day(-1)), that is, growth available to support larger (mesozooplankton) consumer biomass. These are the first group-specific phytoplankton rate estimates in this region, and they demonstrate that integrated primary production is high, exceeding 1 g C m(-2) day(-1) on average, even during a period of reduced upwelling.",

Complex patient management often necessitates transfer to tertiary centers. We aimed to characterize hospital transfer patterns and assess morbidity among patients with FG in Washington State. The Washington State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System includes claims from all hospital discharges in Washington. We identified patients with FG between 2007 and 2013, based on diagnosis and treatment codes. Analyses were stratified by center volume (low-volume centers [LVCs] or high-volume centers [HVCs]), and transfer status. Variables of interest included number of debridements, septic shock, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, length of hospitalization, and death. We identified 165 FG patients. Only 1 HVC treated more than 2 FG patients per year. Overall mortality was 6.7%. Most patients (57%) were treated entirely at LVCs; 87% of patients treated at the HVC were transferred from an LVC. High-volume center -treated patients had similar baseline comorbidities (p = 0.77) and similar mortality (p = 0.87), despite higher rates of septic shock (p < 0.01) and respiratory failure (p = 0.01) compared with LVC patients. Among HVC - transferred patients, immediate compared with delayed transfer was associated with fewer debridements (p < 0.01), lower rates of septic shock (p = 0.05), and acute renal failure (p = 0.04). Patients treated at the HVC were more acutely ill, yet mortality was similar compared with patients treated solely at LVCs, suggesting a benefit to transfer of high acuity patients. Immediate vs delayed transfer may benefit FG health outcomes; however, this may also reflect greater disease acuity of patients with delayed transfer status.",

In this report, we investigated the underlining mechanisms by which DRibbles induced T-cell activation, particularly how DRibbles activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We found that DRibbles could induce a rapid differentiation of monocytes and DC precursor (pre-DC) cells into functional APCs. DRibbles triggered innate receptor signaling via Toll-like Receptors (TLR)-2, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), but not TLR3, TLR5, or TLR9. DRibbles induced PBMCs to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-1β. DRibbles induced IL-1β release from PBMC or THP-1 cells without LPS priming, but required the core machinery of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Active endocytosis was required for inflammasome activation and cross presentation, and blocking endosome acidification or the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway resulted in opposite effects on these two processes. Our data show that DRibbles could induce strong innate immune responses via multiple pattern recognition receptors, and explain why DRibbles could function as excellent antigen carriers to induce adaptive immune responses to both tumor cells and viruses. In contrast to the well-established inhibitory effect of autophagy on the inflammasome activation of APCs, our study demonstrates that isolated autophagosomes (DRibbles) from antigen donor cells activate inflammasomes by providing first and second signals required for IL-1β production by PMBC.",
  "27446232": "Perfusion Angiography in Acute Ischemic Stroke Visualization and quantification of blood flow are essential for the diagnosis and treatment evaluation of cerebrovascular diseases. For rapid imaging of the cerebrovasculature, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard as it offers high spatial resolution. This paper lays out a methodological framework, named perfusion angiography, for the quantitative analysis and visualization of blood flow parameters from DSA images. The parameters, including cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time-to-peak (TTP), and T max, are computed using a bolus tracking method based on the deconvolution of the time-density curve on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The method is tested on 66 acute ischemic stroke patients treated with thrombectomy and/or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and also evaluated on an estimation task with known ground truth. This novel imaging tool provides unique insights into flow mechanisms that cannot be observed directly in DSA sequences and might be used to evaluate the impact of endovascular interventions more precisely.",
  "27494020": "Reduction in Hospital-Wide Clinical Laboratory Specimen Identification Errors following Process Interventions: A 10- Year Retrospective Observational Study Accurate patient identification and specimen labeling at the time of collection are crucial steps in the prevention of medical errors, thereby improving patient safety. All patient specimen identification errors that occurred in the outpatient department (OPD), emergency department (ED), and inpatient department (IPD) of a 3,800- bed academic medical center in Taiwan were documented and analyzed retrospectively from 2005 to 2014. To reduce such errors, the following series of strategies were implemented: a restrictive specimen acceptance policy for the ED and IPD in 2006; a computer-assisted barcode positive patient identification system for the ED and IPD in 2007 and 2010, and automated sample labeling combined with electronic identification systems introduced to the OPD in 2009. Of the 2000345 specimens collected in 2005, 1023 (0.0511%) were identified as having patient identification errors, compared with 58 errors (0.0015%) among 3761238 specimens collected in 2014, after serial interventions; this represents a 97% relative reduction. The total number (rate) of institutional identification errors contributed from the ED, IPD, and OPD over a 10- year period were 423 (0.1058%), 556 (0.0587%), and 44 (0.0067%) errors before the interventions, and 3 (0.0007%), 52 (0.0045%) and 3 (0.0001%) after interventions, representing relative 99%, 92% and 98% reductions, respectively. Accurate patient identification is a challenge of patient safety in different health settings. The data collected in our study indicate that a restrictive specimen acceptance policy, computer-generated positive identification systems, and interdisciplinary cooperation can significantly reduce patient identification errors.",
  "28328236": "Treated Prevalence of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Increased from 2009 to 2015 Among School-Aged Children and Adolescents in the United States The purpose of this brief is to describe changes in the treated prevalence of medically managed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among insured school-aged children and adolescents in the United States from 2009 to 2015. We examine the differences between those with employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) and with Medicaid insurance. We utilized two large longitudinal administrative datasets containing medical and drug claims data on individuals with ESI and Medicaid insurance from Truven Health MarketScan(®) Administrative Claims Databases. Treated prevalence was measured as the percentage of school-aged children and adolescents enrolled in a calendar year who met the criteria for medically managed ADHD in the same calendar year. Subjects were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 6-17 years and were continuously enrolled during a calendar year. The annual prevalence of treated ADHD among school-aged children and adolescents with ESI increased from 4.5% in 2009 to 6.7% in 2015. Among those with Medicaid it increased from 11.3% in 2009 to 13.3% in 2012, and fell after 2012, remaining steady from 2013 through 2015. Treated prevalence of ADHD increased continuously over time among school-aged children and adolescents with ESI, but declined slightly after 2012 among those in the Medicaid sample.",

A randomized controlled trial with 53 adult patients; 26 participants received a SRIT contract, which they could use to refer themselves into a Community Mental Health Centre up to five days for each referral without contacting a doctor in advance. Outcomes were assessed after 12 months with the self-report questionnaires Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13), Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS), and the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-32) and analyzed using linear mixed and regression models. There was no significant effect on PAM-13 (estimated mean difference (emd) -0.41, 95% CI (CI):-7.49-6.67), nor on the RAS (emd 0.02, CI:-0.27-0.31) or BASIS-32 (0.09, CI:-0.28-0.45). An exploratory post hoc analysis showed effect of SRIT in those with low PAM below ≤47 (p=0.049). There were no group differences after 12 months, but both groups maintained their baseline levels. SRIT contracts can be recommended as it supports the rights to self-determination, promote user participation in decision-making in own treatment without any indication of adverse effects.",
  "27251157": "Stimulation of cell proliferation by glutathione monoethyl ester in aged bone marrow stromal cells is associated with the assistance of TERT gene expression and telomerase activity The proliferation and differentiation potential of aged bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are significantly reduced. In order to improve the performance of the aged BMSCs, these cells were treated with 2 mM glutathione monoethyl ester (GSH-MEE) for 24 h. Proliferation rate, telomerase activity, telomere length, and differentiation to cholinergic neuron-like cells (CNLCs) were observed to increase. Though, the expression level of telomerase reverse transcriptase gene increased, but CTC1 and TEN1 genes from Ctc1-Stn1-Ten1 complex encoding proteins with regulatory function significantly decreased. Trypan blue exclusion assay was used to analyze the proliferation and, while telomere length, its several related gene expressions, and telomerase activity were measured using the real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques, respectively. CNLCs differentiation potential was evaluated by estimating the percentage of choline acetyltransferase immunereactive cells .The results suggested that GSH-MEE could improve aged rat BMSC properties and would be of potential benefit for enhancing the performance of aged people's BMSCs.",
  "28256192": "The Insect Pathogens Fungi are the most common disease-causing agents of insects; aside from playing a crucial role in natural ecosystems, insect -killing fungi are being used as alternatives to chemical insecticides and as resources for biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. Some common experimentally tractable genera, such as Metarhizium spp ., exemplify genetic diversity and dispersal because they contain numerous intraspecific variants with distinct environmental and insect host ranges. The availability of tools for molecular genetics and multiple sequenced genomes has made these fungi ideal experimental models for answering basic questions on the genetic and genomic processes behind adaptive phenotypes. For example, comparative genomics of entomopathogenic fungi has shown they exhibit diverse reproductive modes that often determine rates and patterns of genome evolution and are linked as cause or effect with pathogenic strategies. Fungal - insect pathogens represent lifestyle adaptations that evolved numerous times, and there are significant differences in host range and pathogenic strategies between the major groups. However, typically, spores landing on the cuticle produce appressoria and infection pegs that breach the cuticle using mechanical pressure and cuticle - degrading enzymes. Once inside the insect body cavity, fungal pathogens face a potent and comprehensively studied immune defense by which the host attempts to eliminate or reduce an infection. The Fungal Kingdom stands alone in the range, extent, and complexity of their manipulation of arthropod behavior. In part, this is because most only sporulate on cadavers, so they must ensure the dying host positions itself to allow efficient transmission.",
  "28062192": "Direct effects of glucose, insulin, GLP-1, and GIP on bulbospinal neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla in neonatal wistar rats Although patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) often exhibit hypertension, the mechanisms responsible for this correlation are not well known. We hypothesized that the bulbospinal neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are affected by the levels of glucose, insulin, or incretins (glucagon like peptide-1 [GLP-1] or glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide [GIP]) in patients with DM. To investigate whether RVLM neurons are activated by glucose, insulin, GLP-1, or GIP, we examined changes in the membrane potentials of bulbospinal RVLM neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp technique during superfusion with various levels of glucose or these hormones in neonatal Wistar rats. A brainstem - spinal cord preparation was used for the experiments. A low level of glucose stimulated bulbospinal RVLM neurons. During insulin superfusion, almost all the RVLM neurons were depolarized, while during GLP-1 or GIP superfusion, almost all the RVLM neurons were hyperpolarized. Next, histological examinations were performed to examine transporters for glucose and receptors for insulin, GLP-1, and GIP on RVLM neurons. Low - level glucose - depolarized RVLM neurons exhibited the presence of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3). Meanwhile, insulin - depolarized, GLP-1 - hyperpolarized, and GIP - hyperpolarized RVLM neurons showed each of the respective specific receptor. These results indicate that a low level of glucose stimulates bulbospinal RVLM neurons via specific transporters on these neurons, inducing hypertension. Furthermore, an increase in insulin or a reduction in incretins may also activate the sympathetic nervous system and induce hypertension by activating RVLM neurons via their own receptors.",
  "28388882": "An abdominal ectopic pregnancy following a frozen-thawed ART cycle: a case report and r eview of the literature Ectopic pregnancy (EP) occurs in 1% of pregnancies and is reported to be more common in in vitro fertilization / intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF / ICSI) pregnancies. An abdominal ectopic pregnancy (AEP) is a rare form of EP, and there are few reports of an AEP after IVF / ICSI. In this case report, a rare case of AEP after frozen-thawed cycle of ICSI is presented. After a frozen-thawed cycle of ICSI, the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level at 4 weeks 0 days of gestation was 3.4 IU/L. Subsequent dysfunctional uterine bleeding was mistaken for menstruation; however, an AEP of 9 weeks with a fetal heart beat was observed by ultrasound. After the AEP was observed by ultrasound, it was extracted laparoscopically. A rare case of an AEP, which developed after frozen-thawed cycle of ICSI, presented with a very low serum HCG level. Even if the HCG titer is low, follow-up HCG levels and frequent medical examinations are necessary.",
  "28342010": "Aridity promotes bet hedging via delayed hatching: a case study with two temporary pond crustaceans along a latitudinal gradient Climate change does affect not only average rainfall and temperature but also their variation, which can reduce the predictability of suitable conditions for growth and reproduction. This situation is problematic for inhabitants of temporary waters whose reproductive success depends on rainfall and evaporation that determine the length of the aquatic phase. For organisms with long-lived dormant life stages, bet hedging models suggest that a fraction of these should stay dormant during each growing season to buffer against the probability of total reproductive failure in variable environments. Thus far, however, little empirical evidence supports this prediction in aquatic organisms. We study geographic variation in delayed hatching of dormant eggs in natural populations of two crustaceans, Branchinella longirostris and Paralimnadia badia, that occur in temporary rock pools along a 725 km latitudinal aridity gradient in Western Australia. Consistent with bet hedging theory, populations of both species were characterised by delayed hatching under common garden conditions and hatching fractions decreased towards the drier end of the gradient where the probability of reproductive success was shown to be lower. This decrease was most pronounced in the species with the longer maturation time, presumably because it is more sensitive to the higher prevalence of short inundations. Overall, these findings illustrate that regional variation in climate can be reflected in differential investment in bet hedging and hints at a higher importance of delayed hatching to persist when the climate becomes harsher. Such strategies could become exceedingly relevant as determinants of vulnerability under climate change.",
  "27886280": "Starvation - and antibiotics -induced formation of persister cells in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Planktonic stationary and exponential cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are highly resistant to killing by bactericidal antimicrobials because of the presence of persisters, cells that are multidrug tolerant and play a key role in the recalcitrance of biofilm infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the formation of persister cells in P. aeruginosa stationary vs. exponential cultures using different class antimicrobials. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type and mutant strains to antimicrobials were determined by standard microtiter broth dilution method. In order to determine persister formation, dose - and time -dependent killing experiments were performed with antibiotics. Ceftazidime (Cephalosporin) showed little efficacy against either culture. Stationary-phase cells were more tolerant to imipenem (Carbapenem) than exponential cells, leaving a small fraction of persisters at high imipenem concentration in both populations. Polymyxin B (Polymyxin) appeared to be ineffective at low concentrations against both cell populations. Very high polymyxin B concentration completely eradicated exponential cells and regrowth was seen in a stationary population. Stationary cells were more tolerant to tobramycin (Aminoglycoside) than exponential cells but a higher concentration of tobramycin completely eliminated survivors. Ciprofloxacin (Fluoroquinolone) at a low concentration resulted in killing of both cultures of P. aeruginosa, producing persisters that were invulnerable to killing. Stationary cells appear to be somewhat more tolerant than exponential cells in all of these assays. We also showed that nutrient deprivation (serine starvation) regulated by stringent and general stress response, contribute to the increased tolerance of P. aeruginosa exponential and stationary planktonic cells via production of persisters.",
  "27422746": "The blood lipid regulation of Monascus -produced monascin and ankaflavin via the suppression of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol assembly and stimulation of apolipoprotein A1 expression in the liver Monascin (MS) and ankaflavin (AK) produced by Monascus purpureus NTU 568 were proven to show excellent hypolipidemic effects in our previous studies; however, the mechanism is still unclear. This study used MS, AK, and monacolin K as test substances and performed tests on rats fed high-fat and high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks. The lipid levels and the related protein levels of the rats were assessed to understand the effects of MS, AK, and monacolin K on lipid metabolism. MS and AK lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and preserved high-density lipoprotein cholesterol contents. MS and AK inhibited acetyl-coenzyme A acetyltransferase, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 expression, thereby preventing LDL assembly. In addition, enhanced LDL - receptor expression increased the transport of LDL-C to the liver for metabolism. MS and AK also significantly increase apo A1 expression, which facilitates high-density lipoprotein cholesterol formation. Monascus - fermented MS and AK can perform blood lipid regulation via the suppression of LDL-C assembly and stimulation of apo A1 expression in liver.",
  "27898362": "Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure in patients with intellectual disability with special focus on choice of therapeutic intervention There have been a number of studies exploring treatments for psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) but largely neglecting the sizable subgroup of patients with intellectual disability (ID). In the present study, we attempted to demonstrate effects and preferred modes of therapeutic intervention in PNES patients with ID being treated at a Japanese municipal center with a short referral chain. We examined 46 PNES patients with ID (ID group) and 106 PNES patients without ID (non-ID group) retrospectively in case charts. In addition to examining basic demographic and clinical data, effects of different therapeutic intervention were examined as a function of decrease or disappearance of PNES attacks in the ID group. Age at the first visit as well as PNES onset was younger in the ID than in the non-ID group (t=2.651, p=0.009; t=3.528, p=0.001, respectively). PNES -free ratio at the last visit tended to be higher in the non-ID group (chi square =3.455; p=0.063). Psychosis was more often encountered in the ID group (chi square =13.443; p=0.001). Although cognitive therapy and pharmaco-therapeutic approaches were quite similarly distributed in both groups, environmental adjustment was often introduced in the ID group (44%) as compared to the non-ID group (15%) (chi square =14.299; p=0.001). Brief weekly visit service is also more often utilized by the patients with ID (54%) than by those without ID (35%) (chi square =5.021, p=0.025). Optimal treatment approaches in this sizable patient subgroup should be the subject of future prospective studies.",

Additionally, the mitochondrial genome of another member of the Cryphonectriaceae, namely Cryphonectria parasitica (158,902 bp), was retrieved and annotated for comparative purposes. These genomes showed high levels of synteny, especially in regions including genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer, unique open reading frames (uORFs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs), as well as intron positions. Comparative analyses revealed signatures of duplication events, intron number and length variation, and varying intronic ORFs which highlighted the genetic diversity of mt genomes among the Cryphonectriaceae. These mt genomes showed remarkable size polymorphism. The size polymorphism in the mt genomes of these closely related Chrysoporthe species was attributed to the varying number and length of introns, coding sequences and to a lesser extent, intergenic sequences. Compared to publicly available fungal mt genomes, the C. austroafricana mt genome is the second largest in the Ascomycetes thus far.",
  "27627778": "Gelsolin in Onychophora and Tardigrada with notes on its variability in the Ecdysozoa Rearrangements of the filamentous actin network involve a broad range of actin binding proteins. Among these, the gelsolin proteins sever actin filaments, cap their fast growing end and nucleate actin assembly in a calcium - dependent manner. Here, we focus on the gelsolin of the onychophoran Peripatoides novaezealandiae and the eutardigrade Hypsibius dujardini. From the cDNA of P. novaezealandiae we obtained the complete coding sequence with an open reading frame of 2178 bp. It encodes a protein of 726 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 82,610.9Da and a pI of 5.57. This sequence is comprised of six segments (S1-S6). However, analysis of data from TardiBase reveals that the gelsolin of the eutardigrade Hypsibius dujardini has only three segments (S1-S3). The coding sequence consist of 1119 bp for 373 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 42,440.95Da and a pI of 6.17. The Peripatoides and Hypsibius gelsolin revealed both conserved binding motifs for G-actin, F-actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), along with a full set of type-1 and type-2 Ca(2+) - binding sites which could result in the binding of eight and four calcium ions, respectively. Both gelsolin proteins lack a C-terminal latch-helix indicating a more rapid activation in the submicromolar Ca(2+) range. We suggest that a gelsolin with three segments was present in the last common ancestor of the ecdysozoan clade Panarthropoda (Onychophora, Tardigrada, Arthropoda), primarily because the gelsolin of all non-Ecdysozoa studied so far (except Chordata) reveals this number of segments. Mapping of our molecular data onto a well-established phylogeny revealed that the number of gelsolin segments does not correlate with the phylogenetic lineage but rather with particular functional demands to alter the kinetics of actin polymerization.",

Here, we describe a novel simulator with simulated fluoroscopy for cannulation and sphincterotomy training in such situations. A custom-made simulation system was built based upon a common chassis of a series of previously described ERCP simulators. The papilla is made out of organic material and can be cut by high frequency current. The advancement of guidewires and other instruments within transparent mock bile ducts can be viewed in the window of the simulator without the need for fluoroscopy. The ERCP B II / Roux-en-Y simulation system was first evaluated during an ERCP course. There were no technical problems related to the novel simulator during the course. After sphincterotomy, the organic papillae could easily be exchanged within a few seconds. Overall, the novel B II / Roux-en-Y simulator achieved favorable results by trainees and expert endoscopists in all categories assessed. The new B II / Roux-en-Y mechanical simulator is simple and practicable. A first evaluation during an ERCP course showed promising results.",

The primary survey is always the first step in trauma management prior to proceeding with further evaluation and treatment. A 26- year -old man presented with a penetrating nail gun injury through the oral and nasal cavities. He did not present in extremis but required elective endotracheal intubation for intraoperative assessment and treatment. Airway management was enhanced by the use of lingual nerve and inferior alveolar nerve blocks via the Vazirani-Akinosi technique to maintain spontaneous respiration while the tongue was distracted from the palate. The nail was removed and rapid sequence induction initiated for orotracheal intubation. Local nerve blocks can be an effective tool in the armamentarium of the craniomaxillofacial trauma surgeon in managing blunt and penetrating injuries. We demonstrate its utility in airway management when a penetrating foreign body in the upper airway precludes orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation.",
  "27366508": "Does Video Laryngoscopy Offer Advantages over Direct Laryngoscopy during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation? Interruption of chest compressions should be minimized because of its negative effects on survival. This randomized, controlled, cross-over study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of Macintosh, Miller, McCoy and McGrath laryngoscopes during with or without chest compressions in the scope of a simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation scenario. The time required for successful tracheal intubation, number of attempts, dental trauma severity and the need for optimization manoeuvres were recorded during cardiopulmonary resuscitation with and without chest compressions. The experience with computer games during the last 10 years were asked to the participants and recorded. McCoy laryngoscope yielded the shortest time for successful tracheal intubation both in the presence of and without chest compressions. During the use of McCoy laryngoscopes, fewer tracheal intubation attempts, lower incidence of dental trauma and lower visual analogue scale scores on the ease of intubation were recorded. Participants who are experienced computer game players using Macintosh, McCoy and McGrath achieved successful tracheal intubation in a significantly shorter time during resuscitation without chest compressions. Dental trauma incidence and number of tracheal intubation attempts did not show any significant difference between the four laryngoscopes being related to the rate of playing computer games. McGrath video laryngoscopes do not appear to have advantages over direct laryngoscopes for securing a smooth and successful tracheal intubation during rhythmic chest compressions. We believe that as McCoy laryngoscope provided tracheal intubation in a shorter time and with fewer attempts, this laryngoscope may increase the success rate of resuscitation.",
  "26867927": "Radiofrequency ablation of posteroseptal accessory pathways associated with coronary sinus diverticula Posteroseptal accessory pathways may be associated with a coronary sinus (CS) diverticulum. Our purpose was to describe the clinical characteristics, mapping and ablation of these pathways. This was a retrospective study of all patients who underwent ablation of posteroseptal accessory pathways in a single centre. Patients with a diverticulum of the CS or one of its tributaries were included in group I, while the other patients formed group II. Clinical presentation, ablation procedure and outcome were compared between the two groups. A total of 51 patients were included, 16 in group I and 35 in group II. There were no significant differences in age or sex distribution. Atrial fibrillation (AF) and previous unsuccessful ablation were more common in group I. A negative delta wave in lead II was the ECG finding with best sensitivity and specificity for the presence of a diverticulum. A pathway potential was common at the successful site in group I, and the interval between local ventricular electrogram and delta wave onset was shorter (19.5 ± 8 vs 33.1 ± 7.6 ms, p < 0.001). There was a trend toward lower procedural success rate and higher recurrence rate in group I, although this was not significant. CS diverticula should be suspected in patients with manifest posteroseptal accessory pathways who have a previous failed ablation, documented AF or typical electrocardiographic signs. A discrete potential is frequently seen at the successful site, but the local ventricular electrogram is not as early as in other accessory pathways.",
  "27612680": "Early Development Challenges for Drug Products Containing Nanomaterials The vast majority of drug product candidates in early development fail to progress to clinics. This is true for products containing nanomaterials just as for other types of pharmaceuticals. Early development pathways should therefore place high priority on experiments that help candidates fail faster and less expensively. Nanomedicines fail for many reasons, but some are more avoidable than others. Some of the points of failure are not considerations in the development of small molecules or biopharmaceuticals, and so may be unexpected, even to those with previous experience bringing drug products to the clinic. This article reviews experiments that have proven useful in providing \"go/no-go\" decision-making data for nanomedicines in early preclinical development. Of course, the specifics depend on the particulars of the drug product and the nanomaterial type, and not every product shares the same development pathway or the same potential points of failure. Here, we focus on challenges that differ from those in the development of traditional small molecule therapeutics, and on experiments that reveal deficiencies that can only be corrected by essentially starting over-altering the nanomedicine to an extent that all previous characterization and proof-of-concept testing must be repeated. Conducting these experiments early in the development process can save significant resources and time and allow developers to focus on derisked candidates with a greater likelihood of ultimate success.",
  "27428958": "Transcriptome and Metabolome Analyses of Glucosinolates in Two Broccoli Cultivars Following Jasmonate Treatment for the Induction of Glucosinolate Defense to Trichoplusia ni (Hübner) Lepidopteran larvae growth is influenced by host plant glucosinolate (GS) concentrations, which are, in turn, influenced by the phytohormone jasmonate (JA). In order to elucidate insect resistance biomarkers to lepidopteran pests, transcriptome and metabolome analyses following JA treatments were conducted with two broccoli cultivars, Green Magic and VI-158, which have differentially induced indole GSs, neoglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin, respectively. To test these two inducible GSs on growth of cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni), eight neonate cabbage looper larvae were placed onto each of three plants per JA treatments (0, 100, 200, 400 µM) three days after treatment. After five days of feeding, weight of larvae and their survival rate was found to decrease with increasing JA concentrations in both broccoli cultivars. JA - inducible GSs were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Neoglucobrassicin in Green Magic and glucobrassicin in VI-158 leaves were increased in a dose-dependent manner. One or both of these glucosinolates and/or their hydrolysis products showed significant inverse correlations with larval weight and survival (five days after treatment) while being positively correlated with the number of days to pupation. This implies that these two JA - inducible glucosinolates can influence the growth and survival of cabbage looper larvae. Transcriptome profiling supported the observed changes in glucosinolate and their hydrolysis product concentrations following JA treatments. Several genes related to GS metabolism differentiate the two broccoli cultivars in their pattern of transcriptional response to JA treatments. Indicative of the corresponding change in indole GS concentrations, transcripts of the transcription factor MYB122, core structure biosynthesis genes (CYP79B2, UGT74B1, SUR1, SOT16, SOT17, and SOT18), an indole glucosinolate side chain modification gene (IGMT1), and several glucosinolate hydrolysis genes (TGG1, TGG2, and ESM1) were significantly increased in Green Magic (statistically significant in most cases at 400 µM) while UGT74B1 and MYB122 were significantly increased in VI-158. Therefore, these metabolite and transcript biomarker results indicate that transcriptome profiling can identify genes associated with the formation of two different indole GS and their hydrolysis products. Therefore, these metabolite and transcript biomarkers could be useful in an effective marker - assisted breeding strategy for resistance to generalist lepidopteran pests in broccoli and potentially other Brassica vegetables.",
  "27457539": "Safety and immunogenecity of a live attenuated Rift Valley fever vaccine (CL13T) in camels Rift Valley fever is an emerging zoonotic viral disease, enzootic and endemic in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, which poses a significant threat to both human and animal health. The disease is most severe in ruminants causing abortions in pregnant animals, especially sheep animals and high mortality in young populations. High mortality rates and severe clinical manifestation have also been reported among camel populations in Africa, to attend however none of the currently available live vaccines against RVF have been tested for safety and efficacy in this species. In this study, the safety and efficacy (through a neutralizing antibody response) of the thermostable live attenuated RVF CL13T vaccine were evaluated in camels in two different preliminary experiments involving 16 camels, (that 12 camels and 4 pregnant camels). The study revealed that the CL13T vaccine was safe to use in camels and no abortions or teratogenic effects were observed. The single dose of the vaccine stimulated a strong and long-lasting neutralizing antibody response for up to 12 months. The presence of neutralization antibodies is likely to correlate with protection; however protection would need to be confirmed by challenge experiments using the virulent RVF virus.",
  "27688111": "Prognostic significance of non-HPV16 genotypes in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma Recent studies have found that cases with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) positive for HPV16 genotype have better overall survival compared with cases positive for other HPV genotypes. We sought to further replicate these studies and determine if this relationship is modified by expression of p16 tumor suppressor protein. We identified 238 OPSCC cases from the Carolina Head and Neck Cancer Study (CHANCE) study, a population based case-control study. Tumors that tested positive solely for HPV16 genotype and no other genotypes with PCR were classified as HPV16-positive. Tumors positive for any other high-risk HPV genotype were classified as non-HPV16-positive. Expression of p16 in the tumor was determined with immunohistochemistry. Follow-up time was calculated from the date of diagnosis to date of death or December 31, 2013. Overall survival was compared with the Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for smoking, alcohol use, sex, race, and age was calculated with the Cox proportional hazard regression. Cases with HPV16-positive OPSCC had better overall survival than cases with non-HPV16-positive OPSCC (log-rank p-value: 0.010). When restricted to OPSCC cases positive for p16 expression, the same trend continued (log-rank p-value: 0.002). In the adjusted model, cases with non-HPV16-positive OPSCC had greater risk of death compared to cases with HPV16-positive tumors (HR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.60). This finding indicates that HPV genotyping carries valuable prognostic significance in addition to p16 status and future survival studies of OPSCC should take into account differing HPV genotypes.",
  "28459654": "Developmental Hypoxia Has Negligible Effects on Long-Term Hypoxia Tolerance and Aerobic Metabolism of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Exposure to developmental hypoxia can have long-term impacts on the physiological performance of fish because of irreversible plasticity. Wild and captive-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can be exposed to hypoxic conditions during development and continue to experience fluctuating oxygen levels as juveniles and adults. Here, we examine whether developmental hypoxia impacts subsequent hypoxia tolerance and aerobic performance of Atlantic salmon. Individuals at 8°C were exposed to 50% (hypoxia) or 100% (normoxia) dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation (as percent of air saturation) from fertilization for ∼100 d (800 degree days) and then raised in normoxic conditions for a further 15 mo. At 18 mo after fertilization, aerobic scope was calculated in normoxia (100% DO) and acute (18 h) hypoxia (50% DO) from the difference between the minimum and maximum oxygen consumption rates ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively) at 10°C. Hypoxia tolerance was determined as the DO at which loss of equilibrium (LOE) occurred in a constantly decreasing DO environment. There was no difference in [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], or aerobic scope between fish raised in hypoxia or normoxia. There was some evidence that hypoxia tolerance was lower (higher DO at LOE) in hypoxia - raised fish compared with those raised in normoxia, but the magnitude of the effect was small (12.52% DO vs. 11.73% DO at LOE). Acute hypoxia significantly reduced aerobic scope by reducing [Formula: see text], while [Formula: see text] remained unchanged. Interestingly, acute hypoxia uncovered individual -level relationships between DO at LOE and [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and aerobic scope. We discuss our findings in the context of developmental trajectories and the role of aerobic performance in hypoxia tolerance.",
  "28544452": "A Conserved Role for VEGF Signaling in Specification of Homologous Mesenchymal Cell Types Positioned at Spatially Distinct Developmental Addresses in Early Development of Sea Urchins Comparative studies of early development in echinoderms are revealing the tempo and mode of alterations to developmental gene regulatory networks and to the cell types they specify. In euechinoid sea urchins, skeletogenic mesenchyme (SM) ingresses prior to gastrulation at the vegetal pole and aligns into a ring-like array with two bilateral pockets of cells, the sites where spiculogenesis will later occur. In cidaroid sea urchins, the anciently diverged sister clade to euechinoid sea urchins, a homologous SM cell type ingresses later in development, after gastrulation has commenced, and consequently at a distinct developmental address. Thus, a heterochronic shift of ingression of the SM cell type occurred in one of the echinoid lineages. In euechinoids, specification and migration of SM are facilitated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. We describe spatiotemporal expression of vegf and vegfr and experimental manipulations targeting VEGF signaling in the cidaroid Eucidaris tribuloides. Spatially, vegf and vegfr mRNA localizes similarly as in euechinoids, suggesting conserved deployment in echinoids despite their spatially distinct development addresses of ingression. Inhibition of VEGF signaling in E. tribuloides suggests its role in SM specification is conserved in echinoids. Temporal discrepancies between the onset of vegf expression and SM ingression likely result in previous observations of SM \"random wandering\" behavior. Our results indicate that, although the SM cell type in echinoids ingresses into distinct developmental landscapes, it retains a signaling mechanism that restricts their spatial localization to a conserved developmental address where spiculogenesis later occurs.",
  "28092486": "Use of polyclonal / monoclonal antibody therapies in transplantation For over thirty years, antibody (mAb)-based therapies have been a standard component of transplant immunosuppression, and yet much remains to be learned in order for us to truly harness their therapeutic capabilities. Current mAbs used in transplant directly target and destroy graft-destructive immune cells, interrupt cytokine and costimulation -dependent T and B cell activation, and prevent down-stream complement activation. Areas covered: This review summarizes our current approaches to using antibody-based therapies to prevent and treat allograft rejection. It also provides examples of promising novel mAb therapies, and discusses the potential for future mAb development in transplantation. Expert opinion: The broad capability of antibodies, in parallel with our growing ability to synthetically modulate them, offers exciting opportunities to develop better biologic therapeutics. In order to do so, we must further our understanding about the basic biology underlying allograft rejection, and gain better appreciation of how characteristics of therapeutic antibodies affect their efficacy.",
  "27785853": "Helicobacter pylori infection and its related factors in junior high school students in Nagano Prefecture, Japan There have been few reports on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in asymptomatic Japanese children and adolescents. We hypothesized that the prevalence of H. pylori infection is very low among Japanese children and that clinical variables such as serum pepsinogen and iron levels are associated with H. pylori infection. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a sample of 454 junior high school students aged 12-15 years in four areas in Nagano Prefecture. A commercial ELISA kit (E-plate Eiken H. pylori antibody) was used to measure IgG antibody against H. pylori. Serum pepsinogen and iron levels were also measured using standard methods. A urea breath test was performed for seropositive students. The overall prevalence of H. pylori was 3.1% (14/454). There were no significant differences in H. pylori prevalence among mountain, rural, and urban areas. The mean level of both serum pepsinogen (PG I) and PG II was significantly increased in the seropositive subjects compared with the seronegative subjects. When the cutoff values for adults (PG I: 70 ng/mL and PG I / II ratio: 3) were used, 4 of 14 subjects had PG I ≤70 ng/mL and PG I / II ratio ≤3. The results of a logistic regression analysis showed that low serum iron levels were significantly associated with H. pylori infection (P=.02). The prevalence of H. pylori infection is as low as 3% among junior high school students aged 12- 15 years in Japan. The disappearance of H. pylori is accelerating in Japanese children.",
  "27768814": "Non-specific transient mutualism between the plant parasitic nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, and the opportunistic bacterium Serratia quinivorans BXF1, a plant-growth promoting pine endophyte with antagonistic effects The aim of this study is to understand the biological role of Serratia quinivorans BXF1, a bacterium commonly found associated with Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the plant parasitic nematode responsible for pine wilt disease. Therefore, we studied strain BXF1 effect in pine wilt disease. We found that strain BXF1 promoted in vitro nematode reproduction. Moreover, the presence of bacteria led to the absence of nematode chitinase gene (Bxcht-1) expression, suggesting an effect for bacterial chitinase in nematode reproduction. Nevertheless, strain BXF1 was unable to colonize the nematode interior, bind to its cuticle with high affinity or protect the nematode from xenobiotic stress. Interestingly, strain BXF1 was able to promote tomato and pine plant-growth, as well as to colonize its interior, thus, acting like a plant-growth promoting endophyte. Consequently, strain BXF1 failed to induce wilting symptoms when inoculated in pine shoot artificial incisions. This bacterium also presented strong antagonistic activities against fungi and bacteria isolated from Pinus pinaster. Our results suggest that B. xylophilus does not possess a strict symbiotic community capable of inducing pine wilt disease symptoms as previously hypothesized. We show that bacteria like BXF1, which possess plant-growth promoting and antagonistic effects, may be opportunistically associated with B. xylophilus, possibly acquired from the bacterial endophytic community of the host pine.",

Simultaneous perception in treatment group was better than controls at 6- month visit (p < 0.05). Fusional amplitude improved in treatment group but decreased in control group at 3- and 6- months visits (p < 0.001). Near and distance stereopsis in treatment group were better than controls at 3- and 6- months (p < 0.05). The improvements of monocular and binocular acuity in treatment group were better than controls at 3- and 6- months (p < 0.05). Postoperative recurrence rate in treatment group was lower than controls (p < 0.05).

  "28352958": "The epigenetic landscape of age - related diseases: the geroscience perspective In this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding the epigenetics of age - related diseases, focusing on those studies that have described DNA methylation landscape in cardio-vascular diseases, musculoskeletal function and frailty. We stress the importance of adopting the conceptual framework of \" geroscience \", which starts from the observation that advanced age is the major risk factor for several of these pathologies and aims at identifying the mechanistic links between aging and age - related diseases. DNA methylation undergoes a profound remodeling during aging, which includes global hypomethylation of the genome, hypermethylation at specific loci and an increase in inter-individual variation and in stochastic changes of DNA methylation values. These epigenetic modifications can be an important contributor to the development of age - related diseases, but our understanding on the complex relationship between the epigenetic signatures of aging and age - related disease is still poor. The most relevant results in this field come from the use of the so called \" epigenetics clocks \" in cohorts of subjects affected by age - related diseases. We report these studies in final section of this review.",

A cross-sectional, single interview study was performed in an outpatient department of an endocrinology institute. Total 80 type II DM patients without any associated complications of diabetes were included in this study. To diagnose Depressive Episode, structured clinical interview for DSM V was applied. Severity of depression was assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). To assess socio-demographic characteristics of the patients, all of them were evaluated with a semi-structured socio-demographic performa. 38.75% patients (N=31) were found to be suffering from depression. Among them 48.38% were moderately depressed and none were suffering from very severe depression. Significant association was not found between depression and socio-demographic factors of age (p=0.920), gender (p=0.251), economic profile (p=0.583), local background of the patient (p=0.646), educational qualification (p=0.935) and marital status (p=0.644). Similarly no association was found with duration of diabetes, HbA1c and BMI. Exclusion of complicated cases didn't seem to influence overall prevalence of depression, although reduction in severity was apparent. Thus even in those diabetic patients who are leading a complication free life, a detailed psychiatric analysis to rule out depression is mandatory.",
  "28125734": "Identification of MiR-21-5p as a Functional Regulator of Mesothelin Expression Using MicroRNA Capture Affinity Coupled with Next Generation Sequencing MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA expression mainly by silencing target transcripts via binding to miRNA recognition elements (MREs) in the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR). The identification of bona fide targets is challenging for researchers working on the functional aspect of miRNAs. Recently, we developed a method (miR-CATCH) based on biotinylated DNA antisense oligonucleotides that capture the mRNA of interest and facilitates the characterisation of miRNAs::mRNA interactions in a physiological cellular context. Here, the miR-CATCH technique was applied to the mesothelin (MSLN) gene and coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS), to identify miRNAs that regulate MSLN mRNA and that may be responsible for its increased protein levels found in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Biotinylated MSLN oligos were employed to isolate miRNA::MSLN mRNA complexes from a normal cell line (Met-5A) which expresses low levels of MSLN. MiRNAs targeting the MSLN mRNA were identified by NGS and miR-21-5p and miR-100-5p were selected for further validation analyses. MiR-21-5p was shown to be able to modulate MSLN expression in miRNA mimic experiments in a panel of malignant and non-malignant cell lines. Further miRNA inhibitor experiments and luciferase assays in Mero-14 cells validated miR-21-5p as a true regulator of MSLN. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that treatment with miR-21-5p mimic reduced proliferation of MPM cell lines. Altogether, this work shows that the miR-CATCH technique, coupled with NGS and in vitro validation, represents a reliable method to identify native miRNA::mRNA interactions. MiR-21-5p is suggested as novel regulator of MSLN with a possible functional role in cellular growth.",

Surgery has significant morbidity. We hypothesized that delivering chemotherapy directly into tumors through sustained release silk systems could slow tumor growth. Human Ewing sarcoma cells A673 were cultured with vincristine and doxorubicin to determine half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Cells were injected into mouse hind leg to create orthotopic tumors. Tumor volumes were measured using ultrasound. When volume reached >250mm(3,) interventions included: implantation of drug-free silk foam (Control -F), doxorubicin 400μg foam (Dox400 -F), vincristine 50μg foam (Vin50 -F), drug-free silk gel (Control -G), vincristine 50μg gel (Vin50 -G), or single dose intravenous vincristine 50μg (Vin50 -IV). End-point was volume>1000mm(3). Kaplan Meier and ANOVA were used. IC50 for vincristine and doxorubicin was 0.5ng/mL and 200ng/mL, respectively. There was no difference between Dox400 -F [6± 1days to end point (DTEP)] and Control -F (5±1.3 DTEP). Vin50 -F (12.4±3.5 DTEP) had slower growth compared to Control -F (p<0.001), and there was no difference between Vin50 -F and Vin50 -IV (14±0 DTEP). Growth was slowest with Vin50 -G, 28±10.3 DTEP compared to all other treatment groups (p<0.05). Sustained delivery of vincristine inside the sarcoma tumor with silk gel decreased tumor growth. Applying this intratumoral treatment strategy may potentially decrease the extent of surgical excision.",
  "27569088": "Prevalence of HPV genotypes in cervical adenocarcinoma: a study in Greek women To study the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes among cervical adenocarcinomas in Greek women. The study group comprised 78 adenocarcinoma cases (20 in situ and 58 invasive). HPV DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and HPV genotypes were identified by reverse hybridization. There was a high prevalence of HPV infection both for in situ (95%) or invasive (94.83%) adenocarcinomas, comprising also cancers of unusual morphology. HPV 16 was the commonest strain (N=57, 73.08%) followed by HPV 18 (N=28, 35.90%). Interestingly, 13 cases (16.67%) were also HPV 52 positive (as co-infection with HPV 16 or 18). All other strains with the exception of HPV 66 were found only as co-infections. No significant age difference was noted in terms of any HPV strain positivity. HPV DNA was found in the large majority of cervical adenocarcinomas. As opposed to other studies, HPV 52 was the third most commonly encountered strain after HPV 16 and HPV 18. The above findings would probably be of help in decision making concerning vaccination policy for the prevention of HPV infection in Greece.",
  "28542641": "Platelet proteome reveals novel pathways of platelet activation and platelet - mediated immunoregulation in dengue Dengue is the most prevalent human arbovirus disease worldwide. Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes syndromes varying from self-limiting febrile illness to severe dengue. Although dengue pathophysiology is not completely understood, it is widely accepted that increased inflammation plays important roles in dengue pathogenesis. Platelets are blood cells classically known as effectors of hemostasis which have been increasingly recognized to have major immune and inflammatory activities. Nevertheless, the phenotype and effector functions of platelets in dengue pathogenesis are not completely understood. Here we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the protein content of platelets in clinical samples from patients with dengue compared to platelets from healthy donors. Our assays revealed a set of 252 differentially abundant proteins. In silico analyses associated these proteins with key molecular events including platelet activation and inflammatory responses, and with events not previously attributed to platelets during dengue infection including antigen processing and presentation, proteasome activity, and expression of histones. From these results, we conducted functional assays using samples from a larger cohort of patients and demonstrated evidence for platelet activation indicated by P-selectin (CD62P) translocation and secretion of granule-stored chemokines by platelets. In addition, we found evidence that DENV infection triggers HLA class I synthesis and surface expression by a mechanism depending on functional proteasome activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell-free histone H2A released during dengue infection binds to platelets, increasing platelet activation. These findings are consistent with functional importance of HLA class I, proteasome subunits, and histones that we found exclusively in proteome analysis of platelets in samples from dengue patients. Our study provides the first in-depth characterization of the platelet proteome in dengue, and sheds light on new mechanisms of platelet activation and platelet - mediated immune and inflammatory responses.",

In this study, the capacity of SB loaded onto calcium sulfate (CaS) to enhance bone formation was investigated in a rabbit sinus model. Following preparation of the sinus access window on a randomly selected side, SB loaded onto CaS (CaS / SB) was grafted in five rabbits, and CaS alone (control) was grafted in another five rabbits. The animals were euthanized after 4 weeks for radiographic, histometric, and immunohistochemical analyses. There was a statistically significant difference in the total augmented volume between the groups in the radiographic analysis (158.22 ± 39.31 mm(3) and 107.09 ± 39.69 mm(3), respectively, p = 0.040). The CaS / SB group showed a larger portion of mature lamellar bone and a higher level of mineralization of bone trabeculae, characterized by more intense labeling with osteocalcin compared with the control group in the immunohistochemical analysis. The number of osteocalcin-positive cells within the central area of the augmented sinus was significantly higher in the CaS / SB group than in the control group (179 ± 26.0 mm(2) and 123 ± 33.2 mm(2), respectively, p = 0.027). In conclusion, CaS / SB exhibited superior osteogenic potential, especially in the central portion of the augmented sinus as well as improvement of the volume maintenance for sinus augmentation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In our previous investigation, we found a medium correlation between the efficacy and safety of haloperidol and the activity of CYP3A4 in patients with alcohol abuse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the activity of CYP2D6 and the efficacy and safety of haloperidol in patients with diagnosed alcohol abuse. The study involved 70 men (average age: 40.83±9.92 years) with alcohol addiction. A series of psychometric scales were used in the research. The activity of CYP2D6 was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry using the ratio of 6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline to pinoline. Genotyping of CYP2D6 (1846G>A) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. According to results of correlation analysis, statistically significant values of Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) between the activity of CYP2D6 and the difference of points in psychometric scale were obtained in patients receiving haloperidol in injection form (Sheehan Clinical Anxiety Rating Scale =-0.721 [P<0.001] and Udvald for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale =0.692 [P<0.001]) and in those receiving haloperidol in tablet form (Covi Anxiety Scale =-0.851 [P<0.001] and Udvald for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effect Rating Scale =0.797 [P<0.001]).

It shares two receptors with B-cell activating factor (BAFF), B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI). Herein, the equine APRIL was identified from equine adipose-derived stem cell (ASC), and the protein expression of APRIL and its related molecules were detected during the adipogenic differentiation of equine ASC in vitro. The equine APRIL gene was located on chromosome 11, spans 1852 base pairs (bp). Its open reading frame covers 753 bp, encoding a 250-amino acid protein with the typical TNF structure domain. During the two weeks' adipogenic differentiation of equine ASC, although the protein expression of APRIL and TACI had an insignificant change, that of BCMA increased significantly. Moreover, with the addition of recombinant protein His6-sAPRIL, a reduced differentiation of equine ASC toward adipocyte was detected. These results may provide the basis for investigating the role of APRIL in ASC adipogenic differentiation.",

When missing teeth are replaced with implants, the oral surgeon must determine whether or not the super-erupted teeth need to be treated in order to normalize the occlusal plane. In this study, we evaluated the clinical prognosis of dentition after implant placement and prosthetic treatment were completed in an occlusal plane altered by super-erupted teeth in the opposing arch without additional treatment of the super-erupted teeth. Twenty-two patients (9 males, 13 females) were treated with implants and prosthetics without addressing the super-erupted opposing dentition from April 2004 to August 2012 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. A total of 33 implants were placed. Values of crestal bone loss, survival rates, and surgical and prosthetic complications for an average of 29.6 months after prosthetic loading were recorded. In one case, the cover screw was exposed after implant surgery. The mean crestal bone loss was 0.09±0.30 mm. Of the 33 implants, 31 survived, a survival rate of 93.94%. A prosthetic complication occurred in one case but functioned well after correction.

  "27942049": "Potassium depletion stimulates Na-Cl cotransporter via phosphorylation and inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase Kelch-like 3 Kelch-like 3 (KLHL3) is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates blood pressure by targeting With-No-Lysine (WNK) kinases for degradation. Mutations in KLHL3 cause constitutively increased renal salt reabsorption and impaired K(+) secretion, resulting in hypertension and hyperkalemia. Although clinical studies have shown that dietary K(+) intake affects blood pressure, the mechanisms have been obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the KLHL3 ubiquitin ligase complex is involved in the low- K(+) -mediated activation of Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) in the kidney. In the distal convoluted tubules of mice eating a low-K(+) diet, we found increased KLHL3 phosphorylation at S433 (KLHL3(S433-P)), a modification that impairs WNK binding, and also reduced total KLHL3 levels. These changes are accompanied by the accumulation of the target substrate WNK4, and activation of the downstream kinases SPAK (STE20 / SPS1 -related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive 1), resulting in NCC phosphorylation and its accumulation at the plasma membrane. Increased phosphorylation of S433 was explained by increased levels of active, phosphorylated protein kinase C (but not protein kinase A), which directly phosphorylates S433. Moreover, in HEK cells expressing KLHL3 and WNK4, we showed that the activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces KLHL3(S433-P) and increases WNK4 levels by abrogating its ubiquitination. These data demonstrate the role of KLHL3 in low- K(+) -mediated induction of NCC; this physiologic adaptation reduces distal electrogenic Na(+) reabsorption, preventing further renal K(+) loss but promoting increased blood pressure.",

Characteristics predicting the presence of cognitive impairment were also evaluated. Observational cross sectional study of one hundred and fifty five patients with end stage kidney disease recruited from a regional Australian renal unit. Eligible participants included those whose estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate was < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2); were undertaking peritoneal or hemodialysis, or had received a kidney transplant. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool was used to screen the study participants for cognitive impairment and evaluate cognitive deficits. Cognitive impairment was defined as a total Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool score ≤24/30. The extent of cognitive impairment varied between the four groups with end stage kidney disease. Factors predicting the presence of cognitive impairment included undertaking dialysis, age ≥65, male gender, and the presence of diabetes or cerebrovascular disease. Deficits in executive function, attention, language, visuospatial skills, memory and orientation were common amongst the study participants, and these deficits varied according to which end stage kidney disease group the participants were in. Limitations to the study included the cross sectional design and that the presence of confounders like depression were not recorded. The impact of disparities in the cognitive capabilities identified in this study are likely to be far reaching. Tailoring of education and self management programs to the cognitive deficits of individuals is required.",

Starting from the knowledge that the main fraction of atmospheric aerosol in Rome is characterized by significant levels of PM2.5 (almost 75% of PM10 fraction is PM2.5), the paper is focused on submicron particles in such great urban area. The daytime / nighttime, work- / weekdays and cold / hot seasonal trends of submicron particles will be investigated and discussed along with NOx and total PAH drifts demonstrating the primary origin of UFPs from combustion processes. Furthermore, moving from these data, the total dose of submicron particles deposited in the respiratory system (i.e., head, tracheobronchial and alveolar regions in different lung lobes) has been estimated. Dosimeter estimates were performed with the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry model (MPPD v.2.1). The paper discusses the aerosol doses deposited in the respiratory system of individuals exposed in proximity of traffic. During traffic peak hours, about 6.6 × 10(10) particles are deposited into the respiratory system. Such dose is almost entirely made of UFPs. According to the greater dose estimated, right lung lobes are expected to be more susceptible to respiratory pathologies than left lobes.",

Recently, the relationship between CCSP and COPD has been reported. Since COPD results from an abnormal inflammatory response, we hypothesized that CCSP could have a protective role against chronic inflammation - induced lung damage. To address this issue, the pathophysiology of chronic lung inflammation induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CCSP - deficient mice was determined. A tube of 5 mm in length was soaked in a fluid containing P. aeruginosa (PAO01 strain) for 1 week and inserted into the trachea of CCSP - deficient mice. One week later, P. aeruginosa was administered into the trachea. Five weeks after insertion of tube, the mice were sacrificed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were collected to determine the bacterial growth, and the lung histology and physiology were also examined. P. aeruginosa was continuously detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids during the study. Neutrophils were increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from the CCSP - deficient mice in comparison to wild-type mice. A histological study demonstrated chronic inflammation around bronchus, serious bronchial stenosis, and alveolar enlargement in the CCSP - deficient mice. The lung physiology study demonstrated an increase in the lung compliance of the CCSP - deficient mice. Chronic P. aeruginosa inflammation resulted in chronic bronchitis and emphysematous changes in the CCSP - deficient mice. CCSP could play an important role in protecting the host from the chronic inflammation - induced lung damage.",
  "28424240": "The Histone Acetyltransferase Gcn5 Positively Regulates T Cell Activation Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) regulate inducible transcription in multiple cellular processes and during inflammatory and immune response. However, the functions of general control nonrepressed-protein 5 (Gcn5), an evolutionarily conserved HAT from yeast to human, in immune regulation remain unappreciated. In this study, we conditionally deleted Gcn5 (encoded by the Kat2a gene) specifically in T lymphocytes by crossing floxed Gcn5 and Lck-Cre mice, and demonstrated that Gcn5 plays important roles in multiple stages of T cell functions including development, clonal expansion, and differentiation. Loss of Gcn5 functions impaired T cell proliferation, IL-2 production, and Th1 / Th17, but not Th2 and regulatory T cell differentiation. Gcn5 is recruited onto the il-2 promoter by interacting with the NFAT in T cells upon TCR stimulation. Interestingly, instead of directly acetylating NFAT, Gcn5 catalyzes histone H3 lysine H9 acetylation to promote IL-2 production. T cell -specific suppression of Gcn5 partially protected mice from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an experimental model for human multiple sclerosis. Our study reveals previously unknown physiological functions for Gcn5 and a molecular mechanism underlying these functions in regulating T cell immunity. Hence Gcn5 may be an important new target for autoimmune disease therapy.",
  "28122051": "Low Cytochrome Oxidase 1 Links Mitochondrial Dysfunction to Atherosclerosis in Mice and Pigs Cytochrome oxidase IV complex regulates energy production in mitochondria. Therefore, we determined the relation of COX genes with atherosclerosis in mice and pigs. First, we compared atherosclerosis in the aortic arch of age-matched (24 weeks) C57BL/6J control (n = 10), LDL-receptor deficient (n = 8), leptin - deficient ob/ob (n = 10), and double knock-out (lacking LDL-receptor and leptin) mice (n = 12). Low aortic mitochondria -encoded cytochrome oxidase 1 in obese diabetic double knock-out mice was associated with a larger plaque area and higher propensity of M1 macrophages and oxidized LDL. Caloric restriction increased mitochondria -encoded cytochrome oxidase 1 and reduced plaque area and oxidized LDL. This was associated with a reduction of titer of anti-oxidized LDL antibodies, a proxy of systemic oxidative stress. Low of mitochondria -encoded cytochrome oxidase 1 was related to low expression of peroxisome proliferative activated receptors α, δ, and γ and of peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, co-activator 1 alpha reflecting mitochondrial dysfunction. Caloric restriction increased them. To investigate if there was a diabetic / obesity requirement for mitochondria -encoded cytochrome oxidase 1 to be down-regulated, we then studied atherosclerosis in LAD of hypercholesterolemic pigs (n = 37). Pigs at the end of the study were divided in three groups based on increasing LAD plaque complexity according to Stary (Stary I: n = 12; Stary II: n = 13; Stary III: n = 12). Low mitochondria -encoded cytochrome oxidase 1 in isolated plaque macrophages was associated with more complex coronary plaques and oxidized LDL. Nucleus -encoded cytochrome oxidase 4I1 and cytochrome oxidase 10 did not correlate with plaque complexity and oxidative stress. In mice and pigs, MT-COI was inversely related to insulin resistance. Low MT-COI is related to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and atherosclerosis and plaque complexity.",
  "27301553": "Plasmodium falciparum parasite population structure and gene flow associated to anti-malarial drugs resistance in Cambodia Western Cambodia is recognized as the epicentre of emergence of Plasmodium falciparum multi-drug resistance. The emergence of artemisinin resistance has been observed in this area since 2008-2009 and molecular signatures associated to artemisinin resistance have been characterized in k13 gene. At present, one of the major threats faced, is the possible spread of Asian artemisinin resistant parasites over the world threatening millions of people and jeopardizing malaria elimination programme efforts. To anticipate the diffusion of artemisinin resistance, the identification of the P. falciparum population structure and the gene flow among the parasite population in Cambodia are essential. To this end, a mid-throughput PCR - LDR-FMA approach based on LUMINEX technology was developed to screen for genetic barcode in 533 blood samples collected in 2010-2011 from 16 health centres in malaria endemics areas in Cambodia. Based on successful typing of 282 samples, subpopulations were characterized along the borders of the country. Each 11-loci barcode provides evidence supporting allele distribution gradient related to subpopulations and gene flow. The 11-loci barcode successfully identifies recently emerging parasite subpopulations in western Cambodia that are associated with the C580Y dominant allele for artemisinin resistance in k13 gene. A subpopulation was identified in northern Cambodia that was associated to artemisinin (R539T resistant allele of k13 gene) and mefloquine resistance. The gene flow between these subpopulations might have driven the spread of artemisinin resistance over Cambodia.",
  "28228055": "Increased Enoxaparin Dosing for Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in General Trauma Patients To review the evidence regarding increased enoxaparin dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in the general trauma patient population. A search of MEDLINE databases (1946 to October 2016) was conducted using the search terms enoxaparin, thromboembolism prophylaxis, venous thromboembolism, trauma, anti-factor Xa, and weight -based dosing. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations. Search results were limited to English-language studies conducted in humans. Trials that included only obese patients or nontrauma patients were excluded. A total of 7 trials (958 patients) explored the use of increased dosing of enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in trauma patients. Patients were divided by enoxaparin dosing strategies: standard dosing of 30 mg twice daily (BID; n = 509), higher initial dosing regimen (n = 216), or dosing based on anti-FXa level adjustments (n = 233). The majority of the 42 total VTE events (64.3%) occurred in the standard dosing regimen. Within each group, VTE was reported in 5.3% of patients in the standard dosing group, 3.2% in the higher initial dosing group, and 4% in the anti-FXa adjustment group. Initial subtherapeutic anti-FXa levels occurred in 33% to 92% of standard dose patients and 9% to 39% of higher initial dose patients. The average weight -based dose required to achieve a therapeutic level ranged between 0.43 and 0.54 mg/kg/ dose BID. The overall rate of bleeding was low, with 3 incidents (0.37%) reported. Standard - dose enoxaparin prophylaxis may not be optimal for the general trauma patient population. Weight -based enoxaparin dosing (0.5 mg/kg/ dose BID) is an option in trauma patients considered to be at a lower risk of bleeding complications.",

  "27912013": "Sprouting as a gardening strategy to obtain superior supplementary food: evidence from a seed - caching marine worm Only a handful of non-human animals are known to grow their own food by cultivating high-yield fungal or algal crops as staple food. Here we report an alternative strategy utilized by an omnivorous marine worm, Hediste diversicolor, to supplement its diet: gardening by sprouting seeds. In addition to having many other known feeding modes, we showed using video recordings and manipulative mesocosm experiments that this species can also behave like gardeners by deliberately burying cordgrass seeds in their burrows, which has been previously shown to reduce the loss of seeds to water. These seeds, however, are protected by the seed husk, and we used feeding experiments to show that they were not edible for H. diversicolor until they had sprouted or the seed husk had been artificially removed. Additionally, sprouts were shown to be highly nutritious, permitting higher growth rates in H. diversicolor than the low - quality basal food, detritus. We propose both a proximate cause (seed husk as a physical barrier) and ultimate cause (nutritional demand) for this peculiar feeding behavior. Our findings suggest that sprouting may be a common strategy used by seed - collecting animals to exploit nutrients from well-protected seeds.",
  "28103941": "Involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the physiological response to transient common carotid artery occlusion and reperfusion The transient global cerebral hypoperfusion / reperfusion achieved by induction of Bilateral Common Carotid Artery Occlusion followed by Reperfusion (BCCAO / R) may trigger a physiological response in an attempt to preserve tissue and function integrity. There are several candidate molecules among which the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and/or peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) may play a role in modulating oxidative stress and inflammation. The aims of the present study are to evaluate whether the ECS, the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and PPAR-alpha are involved during BCCAO / R in rat brain, and to identify possible markers of the ongoing BCCAO / R - induced challenge in plasma. Adult Wistar rats underwent BCCAO / R with 30 min hypoperfusion followed by 60 min reperfusion. The frontal and temporal - occipital cortices and plasma were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to determine concentrations of endocannabinoids (eCBs) and related molecules behaving as ligands of PPAR-alpha, and of oxidative-stress markers such as lipoperoxides, while Western Blot and immunohistochemistry were used to study protein expression of cannabinoid receptors, COX-2 and PPAR-alpha. Unpaired Student's t-test was used to evaluate statistical differences between groups. The acute BCCAO / R procedure is followed by increased brain tissue levels of the eCBs 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide, palmitoylethanolamide, an avid ligand of PPAR-alpha, lipoperoxides, type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2) cannabinoid receptors, and COX-2, and decreased brain tissue concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), one of the major targets of lipid peroxidation. In plasma, increased levels of anandamide and lipoperoxides were observed. The BCCAO / R stimulated early molecular changes that can be easily traced in brain tissue and plasma, and that are indicative of the tissue physiological response to the reperfusion - induced oxidative stress and inflammation. The observed variations suggest that the positive modulation of the ECS and the increase of proinflammatory substances are directly correlated events. Increase of plasmatic levels of anandamide and lipoperoxides further suggests that dysregulation of these molecules may be taken as an indicator of an ongoing hypoperfusion / reperfusion challenge.",
  "27616751": "Anti-CD45RB and donor-specific spleen cells transfusion inhibition allograft skin rejection mediated by memory T cells Donor-reactive memory T (Tm)cells mediate accelerated rejection, which is known as a barrier to the survival of transplanted organs. Selective interference with the anti-CD45RB monoclonal antibody (α-CD45RB) reliably induces donor - specific tolerance. In this study, pre-sensitization to female C57BL/6 mice with the skin of female BLAB/c mice generated a large number of Tm cells and resulted in rapid rejection of the secondly transplanted allografts. α-CD45RB did induce the tolerance to skin allograft primarily transplanted but failed to induce tolerance in the pre-sensitized mice. Donor-specific spleen cell transfusion (DST) alone also failed to induce the tolerance in the pre-sensitized recipients. Interestingly, combination of α-CD45RB with DST inhibited the rejection induced by memory T cells in the pre-sensitized mice. CD25+ T-cell depletion in α-CD45RB combined with DST therapy recipients could prevent skin allograft tolerance from establishing. In addition, adoptive transfer of donor -primed memory T cells into the tolerant recipients markedly broke the established tolerance. Our findings indicate that α-CD45RB and DST can synergistically inhibit the accelerated rejection mediated by memory T cells and induce long-term skin allograft acceptance in mice.",

The macro- effects of rBCGs on mice were evaluated by phenotype and weight. The immunogenicity of rBCGs was analyzed by lgG, lgG1 and lgG2a antibody titers, and IFN-γ and IL-4 contents through Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Meanwhile, the proportions of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T splenic lymphocytes were determined using flow cytometry. The protective efficacy of rBCGs was evaluated by bacterial load in spleen and lung tissues from immunized mice. rBCGs exhibited no obvious side effects on mice. The antibody titers of lgG, lgG1 and lgG2a, proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and concentrations of IFN-γ were found to be significantly higher in multiple - gene rBCGs than that in single-gene rBCGs (P < 0.05). Bacterial load in both spleen and lung tissues from mice infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv were significantly reduced by rBCGs. A significantly lower bacterial load was revealed in rBCG -1173:A compared with multiple - gene rBCGs (P < 0.05). Immunogenicity was better on multiple - gene rBCGs than on single-gene rBCGs, while excellent protective efficacy was exhibited on rBCG-1173:A and BCG-1173.",
  "27294544": "Nanocatalysts promote Streptococcus mutans biofilm matrix degradation and enhance bacterial killing to suppress dental caries in vivo Dental biofilms (known as plaque) are notoriously difficult to remove or treat because the bacteria can be enmeshed in a protective extracellular matrix. It can also create highly acidic microenvironments that cause acid-dissolution of enamel - apatite on teeth, leading to the onset of dental caries. Current antimicrobial agents are incapable of disrupting the matrix and thereby fail to efficiently kill the microbes within plaque - biofilms. Here, we report a novel strategy to control plaque - biofilms using catalytic nanoparticles (CAT-NP) with peroxidase -like activity that trigger extracellular matrix degradation and cause bacterial death within acidic niches of caries -causing biofilm. CAT-NP containing biocompatible Fe3O4 were developed to catalyze H2O2 to generate free-radicals in situ that simultaneously degrade the biofilm matrix and rapidly kill the embedded bacteria with exceptional efficacy (>5-log reduction of cell-viability). Moreover, it displays an additional property of reducing apatite demineralization in acidic conditions. Using 1-min topical daily treatments akin to a clinical situation, we demonstrate that CAT-NP in combination with H2O2 effectively suppress the onset and severity of dental caries while sparing normal tissues in vivo. Our results reveal the potential to exploit nanocatalysts with enzyme-like activity as a potent alternative approach for treatment of a prevalent biofilm -associated oral disease.",
  "28027163": "The Business of Health Physics - Jobs In A Changing Market The health physics profession was born abruptly when once rare and precious radioactive materials became commonplace. The technological advancements that triggered an industrial complex and ended World War II demanded radiation safety on an unprecedented scale. Until then, protective measures against radiation were largely absent in laboratories. Over the subsequent decades, health physicists began protecting people and the environment in a wide range of settings including medical, research, and industrial. The use of radioactive materials and radiation-generating devices is prevalent today. Radiation doses occur continuously including during airline flights, in our homes, during medical procedures, and in energy production. Radiation is integral to numerous applications including those in medicine, dentistry, manufacturing, construction, scientific research, nuclear electric power generation, and oil and gas exploration. Activities that were once groundbreaking have now become routine and scripted. At higher doses, health effects are understood and avoided. Instruments for the detection and measurement of radiation are at times smarter than their users. Ironically, the same health physics community that has been successful in demonstrating that exposures to radiation and to radioactive materials can be effectively managed is shrinking at an increasingly rapid rate. This paper highlights the creation of past and current jobs, predicts the future opportunities in the profession, and makes recommendations necessary to protect the disappearing specialties.",

Our previous studies have shown that THL can modulate immune response and inhibit tumor growth. In this study, we further evaluated the effect of THL on anticancer immune response in mice vaccinated with γ-ray - irradiated tumor cells. Methods The antitumor effect of THL was determined in mice vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low colon cancer cells or γ-ray-irradiated high-tumorigenic CT-26-high colon cancer cells. The number of natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes in the spleen was analyzed by flow cytometry. The tumor - killing activities of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were analyzed by flow cytometry using YAC-1 and CT-26-high cells, respectively, as target cells. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Results THL suppressed the growth of CT-26-high tumor in mice previously vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low cells or γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the populations of NK cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes in the spleen and enhanced the tumor - killing activities of NK cells and CTL in mice vaccinated with γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α in mice vaccinated with γ-irradiated CT-26-high cells. Conclusion THL can enhance the antitumor immune responses in mice vaccinated with killed tumor cells. These results suggest that THL may be used as a complementary medicine for cancer patients previously treated with killed tumor cell vaccines, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.",
  "27696737": "Highly polygenic architecture of antidepressant treatment response: Comparative analysis of SSRI and NRI treatment in an animal model of depression Response to antidepressant (AD) treatment may be a more polygenic trait than previously hypothesized, with many genetic variants interacting in yet unclear ways. In this study we used methods that can automatically learn to detect patterns of statistical regularity from a sparsely distributed signal across hippocampal transcriptome measurements in a large-scale animal pharmacogenomic study to uncover genomic variations associated with AD. The study used four inbred mouse strains of both sexes, two drug treatments, and a control group (escitalopram, nortriptyline, and saline). Multi-class and binary classification using Machine Learning (ML) and regularization algorithms using iterative and univariate feature selection methods, including InfoGain, mRMR, ANOVA, and Chi Square, were used to uncover genomic markers associated with AD response. Relevant genes were selected based on Jaccard distance and carried forward for gene-network analysis. Linear association methods uncovered only one gene associated with drug treatment response. The implementation of ML algorithms, together with feature reduction methods, revealed a set of 204 genes associated with SSRI and 241 genes associated with NRI response. Although only 10% of genes overlapped across the two drugs, network analysis shows that both drugs modulated the CREB pathway, through different molecular mechanisms. Through careful implementation and optimisations, the algorithms detected a weak signal used to predict whether an animal was treated with nortriptyline (77%) or escitalopram (67%) on an independent testing set. The results from this study indicate that the molecular signature of AD treatment may include a much broader range of genomic markers than previously hypothesized, suggesting that response to medication may be as complex as the pathology. The search for biomarkers of antidepressant treatment response could therefore consider a higher number of genetic markers and their interactions. Through predominately different molecular targets and mechanisms of action, the two drugs modulate the same Creb1 pathway which plays a key role in neurotrophic responses and in inflammatory processes. © 2016 The Authors.

Forensic medical practitioners play a significant role in diagnosing, evaluating and reporting these cases. The Jordanian judicial system is dependent on forensic reports. This study aims to assess the role of forensic medicine in evaluating the physical injuries sustained by women who are abused by their husbands. A retrospective review of 158 forensic reports of Jordanian women alleging assault by their husbands and who were seen at Jordan University Hospital over the period 2010-2015. Of the 158 women who presented, 87 had multiple injuries. The majority of injuries were soft tissue injuries, but others included fractures, tympanic membrane perforation, burns and neck contusions. Twelve women were pregnant at the time of the assessment. The period of incapacity caused by these injuries (an important factor for the Jordanian judicial system) was between 1 and 14 days. Intimate partner violence can present with a range of injuries from relatively minor to potentially disabling or life threatening. Forensic medicine has a role in documenting and evaluating these injuries and advising the judicial system in these cases. These are all key elements in increasing the awareness of the nature and extent of this behavior and its impact on women (and men) and the wider society.",

The enrichment level of DNA aptamers is an important parameter for selecting candidate aptamers for further affinity and specificity determination. This paper is the first report on pattern recognition used for CRP aptamer enrichment levels in the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) process, by applying structure-activity relationship models. After generating 10 rounds of graphene oxide (GO)- SELEX and 1670 molecular descriptors, eight molecular descriptors were selected and five latent variables were then obtained with principal component analysis (PCA), to develop a support vector classification (SVC) model. The SVC model (C=8.1728 and γ=0.2333) optimized by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm possesses an accuracy of 88.15% for the training set. Prediction results of enrichment levels for the sequences with the frequencies of 6 and 5 are reasonable and acceptable, with accuracies of 70.59% and 76.37%, respectively.",

Population-based cohort study. Olmsted County, Minnesota. Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents with incident HF from 2000 to 2010 (mean age 76 ± 14, 56% female) (N = 1,714). The prevalence of 16 chronic conditions obtained at HF diagnosis classified into three groups: cardiovascular (CV) related, other physical, and mental. The mean number of conditions per participant was 2.6 ± 1.5 for CV -related conditions, 1.3 ± 1.1 for other physical conditions, and 0.30 ± 0.61 for mental conditions. After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, 1,073 death s and 6,306 hospitalizations had occurred. After adjustment for age, sex, ejection fraction, in- or outpatient status, and number of other conditions, an increase of one other physical condition was associated with a 14% (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.08-1.20) greater risk of death and a 26% (HR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.20-1.32) greater risk of hospitalization, and an increase of one mental condition was associated with a 31% (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.19-1.44) greater risk of death and an 18% (HR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.07-1.29) greater risk of hospitalization. In contrast, an increase of one CV -related condition was not associated with greater risk of death and was associated with a 10% (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.06-1.15) greater risk of hospitalization. CV -related conditions are the most common type of comorbid conditions in individuals with HF, but other physical and mental conditions are more strongly associated with death and hospitalizations. This underscores the effect of non-CV conditions on outcomes in HF.",
  "27939374": "Mesenchymal stromal cell - secreted chemerin is a novel immunomodulatory molecule driving the migration of ChemR23 - expressing cells Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells characterized by broad immunomodulatory properties exploited for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. However, the efficacy of MSC -based therapy is highly variable and tightly linked to MSC culture conditions and treatment schedule. Thus, the identification of novel key molecules regulating MSC immunomodulatory activities in vivo might constitute a crucial step toward the optimization of currently available clinical protocols. In this regard, herein, we sought to determine whether the newly identified chemotactic protein, chemerin, plays a role in MSC -mediated regulation of inflammation. Chemerin production by human MSCs was investigated under different culture conditions using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After purification, MSC - secreted chemerin was identified using mass spectrometry analysis and the biological activity of secreted isoforms was evaluated using migration assay. Bone marrow - derived MSCs secrete chemerin and express its receptors ChemR23 and CCRL2. Chemerin production is dependent on culture conditions and increases upon stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. In particular, platelet lysate (PL)- MSCs produce higher levels of chemerin compared with fetal bovine serum (FBS)- MSCs. Furthermore, chemerin is secreted by MSCs as an inactive precursor, which can be converted into its active form by exogenous chemerin - activating serine and cysteine proteases. Our data indicate that, in response to various inflammatory stimuli, MSCs secrete high amounts of inactive chemerin, which can then be activated by inflammation - induced tissue proteases. In light of these initial findings, we propose that further analysis of chemerin functions in vivo might constitute a crucial step toward optimizing MSC -based therapy for inflammatory diseases.",
  "27521418": "Defining the sham environment for post-myocardial infarction studies in mice The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of sham surgery in a minimally invasive surgical model of permanent coronary artery occlusion used to generate myocardial infarction (MI) in mice. Adult male C57BL/6J mice (3-6 mo old) were divided into five groups: day (D) 0 (no surgical operation), D1 Sham, D1 MI, D7 Sham, and D7 MI. A refined MI surgery technique was used to approach the coronary artery without the ribs being cut. Both sham and MI mice had the left ventricle (LV) exposed through a small incision. To test the effects of surgery alone, the suture was passed around the coronary artery but not ligated. The MI mice were subjected to permanent coronary artery ligation. The mice were killed at D1 or D7 postsurgical procedure. Compared with D0 no surgery controls, the D1 and D7 sham groups exhibited no surgical mortality and similar necropsy and echocardiographic variables. Surgery alone did not induce an inflammatory cell response, as evidenced by the lack of leukocyte infiltration in the sham groups. Analysis of 165 inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix factors in sham revealed that a minor gene response was initiated but not translated to protein levels. Collagen deposition did not occur in the absence of MI. In contrast, the D1 and D7 MI groups showed the expected robust inflammatory and scar formation responses. When a minimally invasive procedure to generate MI in mice was used, the D0 (no surgical operation) control was an adequate replacement for the use of sham surgery groups.",
  "28466814": "Association of leukemia inhibitory factor gene polymorphism and in vitro fertilization outcome in a population in northern Iran Several studies have been demonstrated that endometrial leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is important in embryo implantation. LIF is a secreted glycoprotein with a variety of biological functions including stimulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival that are all essential for blastocyete development and implantation. The LIF receptor activates several signaling pathways in diverse cell types, including Jak/STAT, MAPK and PI3-kinase pathways in the endometrium of fertile woman. It has been suggested that the initial lower expression of LIF in proliferative phase may be one of the causes for multiple failure of implantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between maternal genotype of SNP 3951C/T LIF and in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF - ET) outcome in infertile women. This case-control study was comprised of infertile patients (n=70) and women having one healthy child as controls (n=73). Genotyping for SNP-3951C/T was performed by PCR/RFLP. Allele and genotype distribution did not differ significantly between patients and controls (P>0.05). The LIF genotype frequencies amongst the 70 cases were C/C =40%, C/T =52.8% and T/T =7.2%; the C and T allele frequencies were 66% and 34%, respectively. The LIF genotype frequencies amongst the 73 controls were C/C =45.20%, C/T =50.70% and T/T =4.1%; the C and T allele frequencies were 70% and 30%, respectively. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that SNP 3951C/T of LIF may not be associated with IVF - ET outcome in this population. Although more studies should be considered with larger number of patients and control subjects to confirm our results.",
  "27358905": "The Demand for Cigarettes in Tanzania and Implications for Tobacco Taxation Policy The study attempts to estimate the demand for cigarettes in Tanzania and presents simulation results on the effect of the cigarette excise tax on smoking participation, government revenue, and related topics. After briefly summarizing the magnitude and spread of cigarette consumption in the country, the paper reviews some empirical estimates from African and other countries. The 2008 Tanzanian household budget survey was used to estimate the demand for cigarettes in Tanzania. The descriptive statistics suggest that the smoking prevalence for Tanzania is 15.35 percent with low variability across expenditure (income) groups. Smoking intensity and per capita consumption were estimated at 7.08 cigarettes and 1.33 cigarettes, respectively, a relatively low value. A two-part demand equation model was used to estimate various elasticities. For the overall equation, the price elasticities of smoking participation, smoking intensity, and total elasticity were estimated at -0.879, -0.853, and -1.732, respectively. Compared to similar results in other developing countries, the estimates appear quite high. When estimated by expenditure (income) groups, the magnitude of the elasticity appears higher among high expenditure groups than among low expenditure groups. Two simulation exercises were undertaken. First, the effect of different excise rates on smoking participation rate, cigarette consumption, tax revenue, and related responses was estimated and highlighted. Second, the same exercise was undertaken to determine the effect of a given increase in the cigarette excise tax on various expenditure groups. The overall results suggest that an increase in the excise tax on cigarettes in Tanzania would reduce cigarette consumption and increase government tax revenue.",

The thickness of the POEGMA brush layers could be well controlled by the polymerization time and density of the immobilized initiators. The interactions between these brush - modified surfaces and the protein - coated polystyrene (PS) particles in newborn calf serum (NBCS) environment were then measured by total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM). In addition, protein adsorption properties onto the polymer brush surface layers were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Relatively large amounts of protein adsorbed to short (4nm and 9nm-thick) POEGMA - coated surfaces or surfaces grafted with a low density of polymer chains. It was considered that shorter polymer chains or chains with low grafted density cannot fully cover the surfaces, proteins in serum could directly interact with the material surface and then deposited to form an adsorbed layer. The TIRM measurements showed that such adsorbed protein layer could mediate the interactions between the two surfaces by generating steric or bridging forces, resulting in different interaction potentials. Some particles were freely diffusing, some experienced intermittent diffusion and more than 50% of particles were irreversibly deposited to the surfaces covered by short polymer brushes. However, for longer (17 and 30nm-thick) POEGMA brush layer surfaces, material surface would be sufficiently covered by the dense coating and the first step of protein adsorption on surface was avoided. TIRM measurements showed that around 95% of the protein - coated particles could freely move in the serum and no attractive force between two surfaces was detected. The steric repulsion generated from the long POEGMA brush layer in the swollen state was long-range and strong so that the protein adsorption is very unlikely. These results concluded that the adsorbed protein layer on POEGMA surfaces plays an important role in regulating the interaction between protein - coated particles and POEGMA surfaces which are highly repellent toward protein adsorption.",
  "28215507": "Significance of uterine corpus tumor invasion in early-stage cervical cancer To examine characteristics and survival outcomes of women with surgically-treated cervical cancer exhibiting uterine corpus tumor invasion. We utilized The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program to identify cervical cancer patients who underwent hysterectomy between 1973 and 2003. Logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for uterine corpus tumor invasion on multivariable analysis. Association of uterine corpus tumor invasion and cause-specific survival (CSS) from cervical cancer was examined with Cox proportional hazard regression models on multivariable analysis. We identified 837 (4.9%) cases of uterine corpus invasion and 16,237 (95.1%) cases of non-invasion. Median follow-up time was 14.0 years. There were 1642 deaths due to cervical cancer. Uterine corpus invasion was independently associated with older age, non-squamous histology, high-grade tumors, large tumor size, and nodal metastasis on multivariable analysis (all, P < 0.001). On univariable analysis, uterine corpus tumor invasion was significantly associated with decreased CSS compared to the non-invasion (5-year rates, 79.0% versus 94.5%, P < 0.001). After controlling for other significant prognostic factors, uterine corpus tumor invasion remained an independent prognostic factor for decreased CSS (adjusted-hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.21-1.74). Among stage T1b cases (n = 6730), uterine corpus tumor invasion remained an independent prognostic factor for decreased CSS (adjusted-hazard ratio 1.95, 95%CI 1.47-2.60). Uterine corpus tumor invasion was significantly associated with decreased CSS in stage T1b1 disease (74.5% versus 90.7%, P < 0.001) and in stage T1b2 disease (67.0% versus 79.5%, P = 0.01). Uterine corpus tumor invasion is an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival of women with early-stage cervical cancer.",

  "28254329": "How do wettability, zeta potential and hydroxylation degree affect the biological response of biomaterials? It is well known that composition, electric charge, wettability and roughness of implant surfaces have great influence on their interaction with the biological fluids and tissues, but systematic studies of different materials in the same experimental conditions are still lacking in the scientific literature. The aim of this research is to investigate the correlations between some surface characteristics (wettability, zeta potential and hydroxylation degree) and the biological response (protein adsorption, blood wettability, cell and bacterial adhesion) to some model biomaterials. The resulting knowledge can be applied for the development of future innovative surfaces for implantable biomaterials. Roughness was not considered as a variable because it is a widely explored feature: smooth surfaces prepared by a controlled protocol were compared in order to have no roughness effects. Three oxides (ZrO2, Al2O3, SiO2), three metals (316LSS steel, Ti, Nb) and two polymers (corona treated polystyrene for cell culture and untreated polystyrene for bacteria culture), widely used for biomedical applications, were considered. The surfaces were characterized by contact profilometry, SEM - EDS, XPS, FTIR, zeta potential and wettability with different fluids. Protein adsorption, blood wettability, bacterial and cell adhesion were evaluated in order to investigate the correlations between the surface physiochemical properties and biological responses. From a methodological standpoint, XPS and electrokinetic measurements emerged as the more suitable techniques respectively for the evaluation of hydroxylation degree and surface charge / isoelectric point. Moreover, determination of wettability by blood appeared a specific and crucial test, the results of which are not easily predictable by using other type of tests. Hydroxylation degree resulted correlated to the wettability by water, but not directly to surface charge. Wetting tests with different media showed the possibility to highlight some differences among look-alike materials. A dependence of protein absorption on hydroxylation degree, charge and wettability was evidenced and its maximum was registered for surfaces with low wettability in both water based and protein containing media and a moderate surface charge. As far as bacterial adhesion is concerned, no effect of surface charge or protein adsorption was evidenced, while the presence of a high acid component of the surface energy appeared significant. Finally, the combination of hydroxylation degree, wettability, surface charge and energy (polar component) emerged as a key parameter for cell adhesion and viability.",
  "27729252": "Lower perinatal mortality in preterm born twins than in singletons: a nationwide study from The Netherlands Twin pregnancies are at increased risk for perinatal morbidity and death because of many factors that include a high incidence of preterm delivery. Compared with singleton pregnancies, overall perinatal risk of death is higher in twin pregnancies; however, for the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate has been reported to be lower in twins. The purpose of this study was to compare perinatal mortality rates in relation to gestational age at birth between singleton and twin pregnancies, taking into account socioeconomic status, fetal sex, and parity. We studied perinatal mortality rates according to gestational age at birth in 1,502,120 singletons pregnancies and 51,658 twin pregnancies without congenital malformations who were delivered between 2002 and 2010 after 28 weeks of gestation. Data were collected from the nationwide Netherlands Perinatal Registry. Overall the perinatal mortality rate in twin pregnancies (6.6/1000 infants) was higher than in singleton pregnancies (4.1/1000 infants). However, in the preterm period, the perinatal mortality rate in twin pregnancies was substantially lower than in singleton pregnancies (10.4 per 1000 infants as compared with 34.5 per 1000 infants, respectively) for infants who were born at <37 weeks of gestation; this held especially for antepartum deaths. After 39 weeks of gestation, the perinatal mortality rate was high er in twin pregnancies. Differences in parity, fetal sex, and socioeconomic status did not explain the observed differences in outcome. Overall the perinatal mortality rate was higher in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies, which is most likely caused by the high preterm birth rate in twins and not by a higher mortality rate for gestation, apart from term pregnancies. During the preterm period, the antepartum mortality rate was much lower in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies. We suggest that this might be partially due to a closer monitoring of twin pregnancies, which indirectly suggests a need for closer surveillance of singleton pregnancies.",
  "28454015": "Air pollution characteristics and health risks in Henan Province, China Events of severe air pollution occurred frequently in China recently, thus understanding of the air pollution characteristics and its health risks is very important. In this work, we analyzed a two-year dataset (March 2014 - February 2016) including daily concentrations of six criteria pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3) from 18 cities in Henan province. Results reveal the serious air pollution status in Henan province, especially the northern part, and Zhengzhou is the city with the worst air quality. Annual average PM2.5 concentrations exceed the second grade of Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standard (75μg/m(3)) at both 2014 and 2015. PM2.5 is typically the major pollutant, but ozone pollution can be significant during summer. Furthermore, as the commonly used air quality index (AQI) neglects the mutual health effects from multiple pollutants, we introduced the aggregate air quality index (AAQI) and health-risk based air quality index (HAQI) to evaluate the health risks. Results show that based on HAQI, the current AQI system likely significantly underestimate the health risks of air pollution, highlighting that the general public may need stricter health protection measures. The population -weighted two-year average HAQI data further demonstrates that all population in the studied cities in Henan province live with polluted air - 72% of the population is exposed to air that is unhealthy for sensitive people, while 28% of people is exposed to air that can be harmful to healthy people; and the health risks are much greater during winter than during other seasons. Future works should further improve the HAQI algorithm, and validate the links between the clinical / epidemiologic data and the HAQI values.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of direct screw repair by using minimally invasive surgery for the lumbar pars interarticulars defects in a pilot study. Direct repair of pars interarticulars defects has been used to treat young adult patients. Reports concerning direct repair by minimally invasive techniques for pars interarticulars defects are quite rare. Review of medical records identified eight consecutive patients treated with intraoperative O-arm based navigation and microendoscopic techniques. Debridement and autograft of pars interarticularis defects was performed under microendoscopic procedure. Then, percutaneous bilateral intralaminar screws were inserted by utilizing intraoperative navigation. The clinical and radiological data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Eight patients had a mean age of 28.4 years, and five were 30 years or younger at the time of treatment. Symptoms included axial back pain in 100% of patients without concomitant radiculopathy. Autograft was used in all cases. The average follow-up duration was 27.4 months with a range of 20 to 33 months. Symptoms resolved completely or partially in all patients. Low back pain visual analog scores decrease from preoperative 6.8 to postoperative 1.4 of eight cases. Of 16 pars defects, healing was observed in 13 (81.3%) at last radiological follow-up. One patient with bilateral fusion failure refused revision surgery because of mild complaint. No complications such as dural tear, nerve root injury, and infection occurred. Minimally invasive direct repair of the pars interarticularis defects with intralaminar screws by using microendoscopic system and navigation procedure can provide safe and effective treatment of spondylolysis with satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes, which need some special tools with steep learning curve. 4.",
  "27536134": "RBBP6: a potential biomarker of apoptosis induction in human cervical cancer cell lines Overexpression of RBBP6 in cancers of the colon, lung, and esophagus makes it a potential target in anticancer therapy. This is especially important because RBBP6 associates with the tumor suppressor gene p53, the inactivation of which has been linked to over 50% of all cancer types. However, the expression of RBBP6 in cancer and its interaction with p53 are yet to be understood in order to determine whether or not RBBP6 is cancer promoting and therefore a potential biomarker. In this study, we manipulated RBBP6 expression levels followed by treatment with either camptothecin or γ-aminobutyric acid in cervical cancer cells to induce apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. We began by staining human cervical cancer tissue sections with anti-RBBP6 monoclonal antibody to evaluate the extent of expression of RBBP6 in patients ' specimens. We followed on with silencing the overexpression of RBBP6 and treatment with anticancer agents to evaluate how the specimens respond to combinational therapy. Apoptosis induction was evaluated through confocal microscope, and flow cytometry using annexin V staining, and also by checking the mitochondrial and caspase-3/7 activity. Cell cycle arrest was evaluated using flow cytometry through staining with propidium iodide. RBBP6 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissue sections that were in stage II or III of development. Silencing RBBP6 followed by treatment with γ-aminobutyric acid and camptothecin seems to sensitize cells to apoptosis induction rather than cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of RBBP6 seems to promote S-phase in cell cycle and cell proliferation. These results predict a proliferative role of RBBP6 in cancer progression rather than as a cancer-causing gene. Furthermore, sensitization of cells to camptothecin - induced apoptosis by RBBP6 targeting suggests a promising tool for halting cervical cancer progression.",
  "28165579": "A national appraisal of haemodialysis vascular access provision in Scotland Published registry data demonstrate longstanding variation in the utilisation of different vascular access (VA) modalities between Scottish renal units; this may reflect different clinical processes between centres. A comprehensive appraisal was undertaken to understand the processes underpinning VA creation and maintenance across Scotland. A mixed methods approach was utilised. Fifty-two semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients and clinicians in all ten, adult and paediatric, Scottish renal units. Interview transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis. Clinical activity data were prospectively collected for six weeks, and correlated with registry data. VA accounts for a large clinical workload. There was significant inter-centre variation in the utilisation of different VA modalities, and patients described frustrating, dissatisfying experiences. VA creation and maintenance pathways functioned best when nephrologists, surgeons and radiologists were co-located on the same campus with close multi-disciplinary working, protected clinical time, and proactive VA maintenance. No unit routinely measured or discussed procedure outcomes or strategic aspects of their service. Varied clinical outcomes reflected varied clinical processes. Optimised clinical pathways, staff education and measurement of clinical outcomes may improve VA service quality and facilitate safer, more effective, patient-centred care.",
  "27867860": "Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 patients -single center early experience In recent years, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become one of the most commonly used primary bariatric procedures for morbid obesity. While laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has well documented positive clinical influence on type 2 diabetes, the role of LSG in diabetes treatment is debatable. The main aim of this study is to present our early experience in LSG as a method of bariatric treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes or abnormalities in glucose homeostasis. Prospectively collected data of patients operated for morbid obesity at the 2nd Department of Surgery. The study was designed to assess the influence of LSG on type 2 diabetes and glucose homeostasis. The primary endpoint was the diabetes type 2 remission. Secondary endpoint was the change of glucose metabolism parameters after LSG. Patients were assessed preoperatively and allocated to two groups: group 1 -with any preoperative abnormalities in glucose homeostasis (prediabetes, diabetes) and group 2 -with non-elevated fasting glucose level. During follow-up (6 months after surgery) all glucose homeostasis parameters were analyzed again. One hundred and thirty-six patients after LSG were enrolled in the study (90 females, 46 males; mean age 40.5±9.9 years). Preoperative abnormalities in glucose homeostasis were confirmed in 64 (47%) patients. Twenty (15%) patients in this group had diabetes. We observed significant reduction of body mass index (BMI) after surgery. Mean percent of EBMIL for all groups after 6 months from surgery was 59.90% (46.75-69.28%). There were no full remissions after surgery in patients with preoperative diabetes. We found significant improvement in biochemical markers of glucose homeostasis. We observed significant reduction of HbA1c % after surgery in both groups. The level of postoperative HbA1c % was related to BMI loss after surgery. LSG leads to significant improvement in biochemical glucose homeostasis and can be considered as a method of treatment in morbidly obese patients with glucose metabolism abnormalities. LSG as a method of treatment for patients with clinical type 2 diabetes still needs some further observation.",
  "27594346": "Recognizing the impact of endemic hepatitis D virus on hepatitis B virus eradication Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in conjunction with hepatitis B virus (HBV) increases adult morbidity and mortality. A number of studies have performed cost-benefit analyses for HBV interventions, but they have ignored the impact of HDV on these outcomes. Using a mathematical model of HBV - HDV epidemiology, we compare health benefits and cost outcomes of four interventions: testing with HBV adult vaccination (diagnosis), diagnosis with antiviral treatment for HBV infections (mono - infections), diagnosis with antiviral treatment for HBV - HDV infections (dual - infections), and awareness programs. The relationship between optimal levels and outcomes of each of these interventions and HDV prevalence in HBV infected individuals ranging from 0 to 50% is determined. Over a 50 year period under no intervention, HBV prevalence, per capita total cost and death toll increase by 2.25%, -$11 and 2.6-fold respectively in moderate HDV endemic regions compared to mono - infected regions; the corresponding values for high HDV endemic regions are 4.2%, -$21 and 3.9-fold. Optimal interventions can be strategized similarly in mono and dually endemic regions. Only implementation of all four interventions achieves a very low HBV prevalence of around 1.5% in a moderate HDV endemic region such as China, with 2.8 million fewer deaths compared to no intervention. Although the policy of implementation of all four interventions costs additional $382 billion compared to no intervention, it still remains cost - effective with an incremental cost - effectiveness ratio of $1400/ QALY. Very high efficacy awareness programs achieve less prevalence with fewer deaths at a lower cost compared to treatment and/or vaccination programs. HDV substantially affects the performance of any HBV - related intervention. Its exclusion results in over-estimation of the effectiveness of HBV interventions.",

We retrospectively included consecutive patients with suspected and/or confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a control group of patients matched for age and sex who underwent cardiac MRI with evaluation of late enhancement. Among other determinations, we evaluated the following parameters on cine sequences: peak filling rate, time to the first peak filling rate, and filling rate normalized to the filling volume. Late enhancement was observed in 29 (73%) of the 40 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The normalized peak filling rate was significantly lower in patients with late enhancement (4.9 ± 1.6 in those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy positive for late enhancement vs. 5.8 ± 2.2 in those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy negative for late enhancement vs. 6.3 ± 1.5 in controls, p = 0.008) and the time to peak filling was longer in patients with late enhancement (540.6 ± 89.7 ms vs. 505.5 ± 99.3 ms in those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy negative for late enhancement vs. 486.9 ± 86.3 ms in controls, p = 0.02).

  "28377738": "Four-Dimensional Graded Consciousness Both the multidimensional phenomenon and the polysemous notion of consciousness continue to prove resistant to consistent measurement and unambiguous definition. This is hardly surprising, given that there is no agreement even as regards the most fundamental issues they involve. One of the basic disagreements present in the continuing debate about consciousness pertains to its gradational nature. The general aim of this article is to show how consciousness might be graded and multidimensional at the same time. We therefore focus on the question of what it is, exactly, that is or could be graded in cases of consciousness, and how we can measure it. Ultimately, four different gradable aspects of consciousness will be described: quality, abstractness, complexity and usefulness, which belong to four different dimensions, these being understood, respectively, as phenomenal, semantic, physiological, and functional. Consequently, consciousness may be said to vary with respect to phenomenal quality, semantic abstraction, physiological complexity, and functional usefulness. It is hoped that such a four-dimensional approach will help to clarify and justify claims about the hierarchical nature of consciousness. The approach also proves explanatorily advantageous, as it enables us not only to draw attention to certain new and important differences in respect of subjective measures of awareness and to justify how a given creature may be ranked higher in one dimension of consciousness and lower in terms of another, but also allows for innovative explanations of a variety of well-known phenomena (amongst these, the interpretations of blindsight and locked-in syndrome will be briefly outlined here). Moreover, a 4D framework makes possible many predictions and hypotheses that may be experimentally tested (We point out a few such possibilities pertaining to interdimensional dependencies).",

Our aim was to determine the ultrasonographical, clinical, and biochemical predictors of malignancy in these patients. A total of 427 patients with cytologically Bethesda Category III (AUS / FLUS) thyroid nodules were included in this retrospective study. We divided the nodules into two subgroups according to the histopathology as benign and malignant, and compared the preoperative ultrasonographical, clinical, and biochemical findings. In overall, 427 patients with 449 AUS / FLUS nodules who had undergone surgery, the rate of malignancy was 23.4 % (105/449). When evaluated separately, the rate of malignancy was 25.8 % in nodules with AUS (82/318) and 17.6 % in nodules with FLUS (23/131) (p = 0.061). The vast majority of malignant specimens in histopathology consisted of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (n = 91, 86.7 %). Preoperative ultrasonographic features of 105 malignant nodules in histopathology were compared with the 344 benign nodules in histopathology. Anteroposterior/Transverse (AP/T) ratio was significantly higher in malignant group compared to benign group (p = 0.013). In multiple logistic analysis, we found that higher AP/T ratio and microcalcification were independently associated with malignancy (p < 0.05). The malignancy -associated cut-off value of AP/T ratio at maximum sensitivity and specificity was ≥0.81. We did not find any correlation between malignancy and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in histopathology in multivariate analysis (p > 0.05). In Bethesda Category III nodules with higher AP/T ratio and microcalcification, surgery might be considered as a first therapeutic option instead of repeat fine-needle aspiration biopsy or observation.",
  "27551992": "Engaging adolescent girls in transactional sex through compensated dating Transactional sex through so-called compensated dating in adolescent girls is a problem in need of public concern. Compensated dating typically involves the use of information communication technology to advertise, search, bargain, and eventually arrange for transactional sex. The technology enables the sexual partners to maintain privacy and secrecy in transactional sex. Such secrecy necessitates the girls ' disclosure about their life experiences in order to address the concern. The disclosure is the focus of the present qualitative study of 27 girls practicing the dating in Hong Kong, China. Based on the disclosure, the study presents a grounded theory that epitomizes engagement in compensated dating by referential choice. Such a referential choice theory unravels that choice with reference to the family push and social norms sustains the engagement. Meanwhile, the choice rests on expectancy and reinforcement from experiential learning about compensated dating. The theory thus implies ways to undercut the engagement through diverting the referential choice of the dating.",
  "27284491": "Mutation profiles of synchronous colorectal cancers from a patient with Lynch syndrome suggest distinct oncogenic pathways Patients with Lynch syndrome often present with multiple synchronous or metachronous colorectal cancers (CRCs). The presence of multiple CRCs with distinct genetic profiles and driver mutations could complicate treatment as each cancer may respond differently to therapy. Studies of sporadic CRCs suggested that synchronous tumors have distinct etiologies, but could not rule out differences in genetic background. The presence of multiple cancers in a patient with a predisposing mutation provides an opportunity to profile synchronous cancers in the same genetic background. Here, we describe the case of a patient with Lynch syndrome that presented with six synchronous CRCs. Microsatellite instability (MSI) and genomic profiling indicated that each lesion had a unique pattern of instability and a distinct profile of affected genes. These findings support the idea that in Lynch syndrome, synchronous CRCs can develop in parallel with distinct mutation profiles and that these differences may inform treatment decisions.",

Chrysin has been reported to have anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-aromatase activities but its water insoluble properties limit its pharmaceutical application. In the present study, chrysin loaded poloxamer micelles were developed. Two types of poloxamers, Pluronic F-68 and Pluronic F-127 were compared. It was found that chrysin loaded Pluronic F-68 micelles (CS-P68) and chrysin loaded Pluronic F-127 micelles (CS-P127) obviously increase the aqueous solubility of chrysin. The results also indicated that the type of polymer and ratio of drug to polymer affected size and desirable characteristics of the micelles. The micelle system of CS-P68 and CS-P127 formed at drug to polymer ratios of 1:4 and 1:2, respectively, was found to be the most suitable monodispersed system with a nanosize-range diameter. The in vivo study in zebrafish eggs indicates that the toxicity of CS-P68 and CS-P127 is a dose response. CS-P68 and CS-P127 at a drug dose of 10 ng/mL or less is safe for zebrafish embryo growth. The results of this study indicate enhanced water solubility of chrysin. Chrysin loaded poloxamer micelles are promising for further use in in vivo studies in mammalian animals and humans.",

Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that over-testing is a significant problem and has the potential for patient harm. Test result audit and feedback (TRAFk) is a teaching and supervision method in general practice training, but no previous studies have investigated its utility. The objective of this article is to describe the outcomes of an educational intervention for general practice supervisors on TRAFk. We developed and delivered a workshop to general practice supervisors and administered pre- and post-workshop surveys. Of the 54 supervisors who participated in the study, a substantial proportion (79.6%) used TRAFk after the workshop. Participants highly rated the method across a range of supervision areas, including clinical reasoning, test ordering quality and patient safety. Our findings reinforce the educational utility of this supervision method in general practice training for the teaching and assessment of registrars.",

In a model system, DNA assay was achieved by using molecular beacon (MB) probes anchored on a CdS QDs modified electrode, and the MB probes contain two segments that can hybridize with both target DNA sequence and the label of DNA encapsulated Ag NCs. After the MB probe was unfolded by the target DNA sequence, the labels of oligonucleotide encapsulated Ag NCs would be brought in close proximity to the CdS QDs electrode surface, and efficient photocurrent quenching of QDs could be resulted from an energy transfer process that originated from NCs. Thus, by monitoring the attenuation in the photocurrent signal, an elegant and sensitive PEC DNA bioanalysis could be accomplished. The developed biosensor displayed a linear range from 1.0pM to 10nM and the detection limit was experimentally found to be of 0.3pM. This work presents a feasible signaling principle that could act as a common basis for general PEC bioanalysis development.",

A study published in BMJ Quality & Safety in 2014 estimated that diagnostic errors affect at least 5% of US adults (or 12 million) per year. We sought to explore online public reactions to media reports on the reported frequency of diagnostic errors in the US adult population. We searched the World Wide Web for any news article reporting findings from the study. We then gathered all the online comments made in response to the news articles to evaluate public reaction to the newly reported diagnostic error frequency (n=241). Two coders conducted content analyses of the comments and an experienced qualitative researcher resolved differences. Overall, there were few comments made regarding the frequency of diagnostic errors. However, in response to the media coverage, 44 commenters shared personal experiences of diagnostic errors. Additionally, commentary centered on diagnosis - related quality of care as affected by two emergent categories: (1) US health care providers (n=79; 63 commenters) and (2) US health care reform-related policies, most commonly the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and insurance/reimbursement issues (n=62; 47 commenters). The public appears to have substantial concerns about the impact of the ACA and other reform initiatives on the diagnosis - related quality of care. However, policy discussions on diagnostic errors are largely absent from the current national conversation on improving quality and safety. Because outpatient diagnostic errors have emerged as a major safety concern, researchers and policymakers should consider evaluating the effects of policy and practice changes on diagnostic accuracy.",
  "28263460": "Asunaprevir: An HCV Protease Inhibitor With Preferential Liver Distribution Asunaprevir is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease, demonstrating efficacy in clinical studies in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 or 4, with either peginterferon / ribavirin or combinations of direct-acting antivirals. Because of preferential distribution of asunaprevir to the liver via organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)- mediated transport, asunaprevir demonstrates high apparent oral clearance and very low plasma concentrations. Asunaprevir plasma concentrations are markedly increased by single-dose rifampin (an OATP inhibitor) and in subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. In addition, modestly higher plasma concentrations of asunaprevir have been noted in subjects infected with HCV relative to healthy subjects and in Asian subjects relative to whites. At the marketed dose, infrequent hepatic transaminase abnormalities were poorly predicted by plasma concentrations. For a compound with these characteristics, hepatic concentrations may have provided an improved understanding of the in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to support decision making during development.",
  "28360224": "Ultrasound evaluation of diaphragm function in mechanically ventilated patients: comparison to phrenic stimulation and prognostic implications In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, diaphragm dysfunction is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Ultrasound measurements of diaphragm thickness, excursion (EXdi) and thickening fraction (TFdi) are putative estimators of diaphragm function, but have never been compared with phrenic nerve stimulation. Our aim was to describe the relationship between these variables and diaphragm function evaluated using the change in endotracheal pressure after phrenic nerve stimulation (Ptr,stim), and to compare their prognostic value. Between November 2014 and June 2015, Ptr,stim and ultrasound variables were measured in mechanically ventilated patients <24 hours after intubation (' initiation of mechanical ventilation (MV)', under assist-control ventilation, ACV) and at the time of switch to pressure support ventilation ('switch to PSV '), and compared using Spearman's correlation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Diaphragm dysfunction was defined as Ptr,stim <11 cm H2O. 112 patients were included. At initiation of MV, Ptr,stim was not correlated to diaphragm thickness (p=0.28), EXdi (p=0.66) or TFdi (p=0.80). At switch to PSV, TFdi and EXdi were respectively very strongly and moderately correlated to Ptr,stim, (r=0.87, p<0.001 and 0.45, p=0.001), but diaphragm thickness was not (p=0.45). A TFdi <29% could reliably identify diaphragm dysfunction (sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 88%), but diaphragm thickness and EXdi could not. This value was associated with increased duration of ICU stay and MV, and mortality. Under ACV, diaphragm thickness, EXdi and TFdi were uncorrelated to Ptr,stim. Under PSV, TFdi was strongly correlated to diaphragm strength and both were predictors of remaining length of MV and ICU and hospital death.",
  "27312487": "Osteopontin expression in co-cultures of human squamous cell carcinoma -derived cells and osteoblastic cells and its effects on the neoplastic cell phenotype and osteoclastic activation This study evaluated the temporal expression of osteopontin (OPN) in co-cultures of human osteoblastic cells (SAOS-2) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-derived cells (SCC9) and examined the effects of osteoblast -derived OPN on the neoplastic cell phenotype. Additionally, the effects of these co-cultures on subsequent osteoclastic activity were explored. SCC9 cells were plated on Transwell® membranes that were either coated or not coated with Matrigel and were then co-cultured with SAOS-2 cells during the peak of OPN expression. SCC9 cells exposed to OPN -silenced SAOS-2 cultures and SCC9 cells cultured alone served as controls. SCC9 cells were quantitatively evaluated for cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and invasion into Matrigel. The impact of co-culturing SAOS-2 and SCC9 cells on the resorptive capacity of U-937 -derived osteoclastic cells was also investigated. Furthermore, a reciprocal induction of SAOS-2 and SCC9 cells in terms of OPN expression over the co-culture interval was identified. SAOS-2 -secreted OPN altered the SCC9 cell phenotype, leading to enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation and higher Matrigel invasion. This invasion was also enhanced, albeit to a lesser degree, by co-culture with OPN - silenced SAOS-2 cells. Cell migration was not affected. Co-culture with SAOS-2 cells -mainly during the period of peak OPN expression -promoted over-expression of IL-6 and IL-8 by SCC9 cells and enhanced the resorptive capacity of osteoclastic cells. Taken together, these results suggest that osteoblast -derived OPN affects the interactions among OSCC -derived epithelial cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts, which could contribute to the process of bone destruction during bone invasion by OSCC.",

The aim of this translational study was to investigate the effect of long-term eplerenone administration on renal allograft function in children with biopsy -proven chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Renal transplant children <18 years, biopsy -proven CAN, and a GFR >40 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were included. Patients with BK virus active nephritis, recurrence of renal disease, GFR decline in previous 3 months, or treated with calcium antagonists or antifungal drugs were excluded. They were randomized to receive placebo (n=10) or eplerenone 25 mg/d for 24 months (n=13). Visits were scheduled at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. At each period, a complete clinical examination was performed and blood and urine samples were taken. Urine creatinine, 8-hydroxylated-guanosine, heat shock protein 72 (HSP72), and kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) levels were also assessed. In kidney biopsy samples, the tubulo-interstitial area affected by fibrosis (TIF) and glomerulosclerosis were measured at baseline and after 24 months. The baseline eGFR was 80±6 in the placebo and 86±6 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in the eplerenone group; at 24 months it was 66±8 and 81±7 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively (P=0.33; 95% confidence intervals, -18 to 33 at baseline, and -11 to 40 after 24 months). The albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 110±74 in the placebo, and 265±140 mg/g in the eplerenone group; and after 24 months it was 276±140 and 228±88 mg/g, respectively (P=0.15; 95% confidence intervals, -283 to 593, and -485 to 391, respectively). In addition, the placebo exhibited a greater TIF, glomerulosclerosis, and urinary HSP72 compared with the eplerenone group. Although this study was underpowered to provide definitive evidence that long-term eplerenone administration attenuates the progression of CAN in pediatric transplant patients, it encourages testing the potential benefit of MRB in this pediatric population.",
  "28418943": "Loss of control over alcohol seeking in rats depends on individual vulnerability and duration of alcohol consumption experience Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by excessive alcohol use and persistent alcohol seeking despite knowledge of its negative consequences. Importantly, AUD typically develops after chronic excessive alcohol use in a subgroup of individuals who drink alcohol, suggesting that AUD results from an interaction between individual vulnerability and prolonged alcohol exposure. The present study assessed the contribution of prolonged exposure to alcohol and individual levels of alcohol intake to the development of loss of control over alcohol seeking in a conditioned suppression model. To investigate the impact of prolonged alcohol exposure, conditioned suppression of alcohol seeking was assessed after 2 and 4 months of intermittent alcohol access (IAA) in a subgroup of rats drinking moderate amounts of alcohol. We observed that suppression of alcohol seeking was reduced after 4 months compared with 2 months of IAA. The influence of individual levels of alcohol intake on loss of control over alcohol seeking was subsequently determined by assessing conditioned suppression in subgroups of low and high alcohol drinking rats. Unlike the low alcohol drinking rats, the high alcohol drinking rats showed aversion-resistant alcohol seeking after 2 months of IAA, although both groups showed comparable levels of conditioned freezing. These findings show that the development of loss of control over alcohol seeking, a key characteristic of AUD in humans, is dependent on both the extent of alcohol exposure and the individual's propensity to consume alcohol.",
  "27237301": "Clinical value of pathologic examination of non-neoplastic kidney in patients with upper urinary tract malignancies While surgical resection remains the standard of care in the treatment of upper urinary tract malignancies, nephrectomy is a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to determine whether histologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney could enable early identification of unrecognized kidney disease and could be of prognostic value in predicting postoperative renal outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 51 patients with upper urinary tract malignancies who received uninephrectomy or uninephroureterectomy. A thorough pathologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney including special stains, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic studies was performed. The degree of parenchymal changes was graded from 0 to 15. Of 51 patients, only 13 showed normal kidney pathology. Fifteen patients showed glomerular abnormalities, 14 showed diabetic nephropathy, and 11 showed vascular nephropathy. There was one case each of reflux nephropathy and chronic pyelonephritis. The median histologic score was 5 points. Only 25.4% of patients had ≤ 3 points. Score more than 5 was observed in 47.1% of patients. Postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 3 to 36 months were obtained from 90.2% of patients, and of those, 34.8% had de novo CKD. Since no one had CKD in partial nephrectomized patients, we determined risk factors for CKD in radical nephrectomized patients. Cox regression analysis revealed that postoperative AKI, preoperative eGFR, and histologic score of non-neoplastic kidney were the independent predictors for CKD. We conclude that routine pathologic evaluation of non-neoplastic kidney provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information.",
  "27599297": "Detection of busulfan adducts on proteins Busulfan is a bifunctional alkyl sulfonate antineoplastic drug. This alkylating agent was described as forming covalent adducts on proteins. However, only limited data are available regarding the interaction of busulfan with proteins. Mass spectrometry and bioinformatics were used to identify busulfan adducts on human serum albumin and hemoglobin. Albumin and hemoglobin were incubated with busulfan or control compounds, digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS / MS on a Thermo Fisher LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro. MS data were used to generate spectral libraries of non-modified peptides and an open modification search was performed to identify potential adduct mass shifts and possible modification sites. Results were confirmed by a second database search including identified mass shifts and by visual inspection of annotated tandem mass spectra of adduct -carrying peptides. Five structures of busulfan adducts were detected and a chemical structure could be attributed to four of them. Two were primary adducts corresponding to busulfan monoalkylation and alkylation of two amino acid residues by a single busulfan molecule. Two others corresponded to secondary adducts generated during sample processing. Adducts were mainly detected on Asp, Glu, and His residues. These findings were confirmed by subsequent database searches and experiments with synthetic peptides. The combination of in vitro incubation of proteins with the drug of interest or control compounds, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and open modification search allowed confirming direct interaction of busulfan with proteins and characterizing resulting adducts. Our results also showed that careful analysis of the data is required to detect experimental artifacts.",

  "27802454": "Impact of SPARC expression on outcome in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer not receiving nab-paclitaxel: a pooled analysis from prospective clinical and translational trials Conflicting results on the role of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteins (SPARC) expression have been reported in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and its prognostic and/or predictive role in advanced PDAC (aPDAC) has not been extensively investigated yet. This study was designed to evaluate SPARC expression as a biomarker in aPDAC patients (pts) not receiving nab-paclitaxel. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the stromal as well as the tumoral (i.e., cytoplasmic) SPARC expression in tumour tissue (primary tumours and metastases) of 134 aPDAC pts participating in completed prospective clinical and biomarker trials. The SPARC expression levels were correlated to the pts' clinicopathological parameters and survival times. Sixty-seven per cent of the analysed tumours showed high stromal SPARC expression, which was not associated with overall survival (OS, median 9.1 vs 7.6 months, P=0.316). A positive cytoplasmic SPARC expression was detected in 55% of the tumours and correlated significantly with inferior progression-free survival (PFS, 6.2 vs 8.6 months, P=0.004) and OS (7.8 vs 8.4 months, P=0.032). This association was strongest for pts, where primary tumour tissue was examined (PFS: 6.7 vs 10.8 months, P=0.004; OS: 7.9 vs 11.9 months, P=0.030), whereas no significant correlation was detected for pts, where only metastatic tissue was available (PFS: 5.8 vs 6.6 months, P=0.502; OS: 7.0 vs 7.8 months, P=0.452). In pts receiving gemcitabine -based chemotherapy cytoplasmic SPARC expression was significantly associated with an inferior PFS and OS (PFS: 6.2 vs 9.2 months, P=0.002; OS 7.3 vs 9.9 months, P=0.012), whereas no such association was detected for stromal SPARC expression or for pts receiving fluoropyrimidine -based chemotherapy. We identified cytoplasmic SPARC expression in the primary tumour as a biomarker associated with inferior PFS and OS in aPDAC. Cytoplasmic SPARC expression may furthermore act as a negative predictive biomarker in pts treated with gemcitabine -based chemotherapy.",
  "27805887": "Successful Restoration of Severely Mutilated Primary Incisors Using a Novel Method to Retain Zirconia Crowns - Two Year Results This manuscript describes a simple reliable technique for restoring severely mutilated primary anterior teeth. A rigid glass ionomer post is created over which zirconia crowns can be fitted to achieve a long-term stable esthetic restoration for primary anterior teeth. Children aged 2-5 years with two up to six extensively decayed upper primary incisors were included. Fuji IX was condensed into an intracanal space created to a depth of 3mm, to provide a core which also extended 3mm supragingivally. Crown preparations were completed upon these cores. Zirconia crowns (Nusmile, Houston Texas USA) were fitted and cemented over the prepared cores. All patients were recalled at regular intervals. Twenty-three healthy children with 86 restorations participated in the study. The overall survival of the restorations was 95.3% after 12 months and 80.2% after 24 months. According to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the median survival time was not reached while the estimated mean survival time was 22.9 months. This newly described clinical technique is simple and reliable to use for restoration of extensively decayed primary incisors. Use of zirconia crowns retained using this technique offers superior esthetic, durable restorations with remarkable gingival response up to 24 months.",
  "27371818": "Design considerations for patient-specific surgical templates for total hip arthroplasty with respect to acetabular cartilage Patient-specific instruments (PSIs) are clinically used to support the surgeon during a planned intervention. The planning is typically done based on volumetric image data from medical imaging systems, e.g. computed tomography (CT). The PSI uses the known surface structure of a bone for orientation during the intervention. Some surfaces of human bone are covered with a layer of cartilage which is hardly visible in clinically applied CT-imaging. This experimental study investigates ten different PSI designs and their effect to the overall accuracy when neglecting the cartilage in the design process. Therefore, a model of an acetabulum is used to simulate the use case of PSI in total hip arthroplasty. The concept of the different designs is to create structural elasticities in the PSI to avoid shifting of the whole instrument and rather have a small part of it deformed by cartilage. A needle array structure, for instance, should also be able to oust or penetrate remaining soft tissue in the acetabulum.",
  "28530664": "Flexible information routing by transient synchrony Perception, cognition and behavior rely on flexible communication between microcircuits in distinct cortical regions. The mechanisms underlying rapid information rerouting between such microcircuits are still unknown. It has been proposed that changing patterns of coherence between local gamma rhythms support flexible information rerouting. The stochastic and transient nature of gamma oscillations in vivo, however, is hard to reconcile with such a function. Here we show that models of cortical circuits near the onset of oscillatory synchrony selectively route input signals despite the short duration of gamma bursts and the irregularity of neuronal firing. In canonical multiarea circuits, we find that gamma bursts spontaneously arise with matched timing and frequency and that they organize information flow by large-scale routing states. Specific self-organized routing states can be induced by minor modulations of background activity.",

Herein, we reported a facile strategy to construct MSNs coated by enzyme - resposive polylysine - dopamine (PLDA) films through self-polymerization of dopamine derivative lysine - dopamine, in which the drug could be loaded and delivered efficiently. In detail, RhB or DOX was used as a drug model and loaded in functional MSNs via a one-pot procedure among MSNs, drug, and lysine - dopamine (LDA) under basic conditions. Owing to the fact that the peptide bonds between lysine and dopamine can be cleaved under triggering by pepsin, the resulting RhB / DOX @ PLDA - MSNs exibit enzyme - responsive characterization. After the DOX @ PLDA - MSNs enter into the cancer cells, the drug can be released effectively through degradation of peptide bonds under the influence of enzyme in cancer cells, which shows marked anticancer activity in vitro. This facile strategy may provide a new platform to construct enzyme - responsive controlled drug delivery systems.",
  "27725659": "Rare deleterious mutations are associated with disease in bipolar disorder families Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common, complex and heritable psychiatric disorder characterized by episodes of severe mood swings. The identification of rare, damaging genomic mutations in families with BD could inform about disease mechanisms and lead to new therapeutic interventions. To determine whether rare, damaging mutations shared identity-by-descent in families with BD could be associated with disease, exome sequencing was performed in multigenerational families of the NIMH BD Family Study followed by in silico functional prediction. Disease association and disease specificity was determined using 5090 exomes from the Sweden - Schizophrenia (SZ) Population -Based Case- Control Exome Sequencing study. We identified 14 rare and likely deleterious mutations in 14 genes that were shared identity-by-descent among affected family members. The variants were associated with BD (P<0.05 after Bonferroni's correction) and disease specificity was supported by the absence of the mutations in patients with SZ. In addition, we found rare, functional mutations in known causal genes for neuropsychiatric disorders including holoprosencephaly and epilepsy. Our results demonstrate that exome sequencing in multigenerational families with BD is effective in identifying rare genomic variants of potential clinical relevance and also disease modifiers related to coexisting medical conditions. Replication of our results and experimental validation are required before disease causation could be assumed.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 11 October 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.181.",

The synthesized Ag NPs were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope analysis. The as- prepared Ag NPs were well-dispersed, showing a surface plasmon resonance peak at 426 nm. The resulted Ag NPs @ CA nanohybrids exhibit high catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4. Meanwhile, the nanohybrids are also effective in inhibiting the growth of bacterial.

The three criteria, proposed by Sgarbossa et al. in 1996, useful to suspect myocardial ischaemia in patient with left bundle branch block were demonstrated to be valid also in pacemaker patients. In the last years, concordant negative T waves in patients with ventricular paced rhythm were linked to various expressions of acute myocardial injury. If available, comparison with previous ECG is crucial. Partial persistence of cardiac memory during fusion beats created an anomalous concordance between negative T waves and QRS axis and could induce erroneous suspicions.

  "28426667": "Bioenergetic status modulates motor neuron vulnerability and pathogenesis in a zebrafish model of spinal muscular atrophy Degeneration and loss of lower motor neurons is the major pathological hallmark of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), resulting from low levels of ubiquitously-expressed survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. One remarkable, yet unresolved, feature of SMA is that not all motor neurons are equally affected, with some populations displaying a robust resistance to the disease. Here, we demonstrate that selective vulnerability of distinct motor neuron pools arises from fundamental modifications to their basal molecular profiles. Comparative gene expression profiling of motor neurons innervating the extensor digitorum longus (disease-resistant), gastrocnemius (intermediate vulnerability), and tibialis anterior (vulnerable) muscles in mice revealed that disease susceptibility correlates strongly with a modified bioenergetic profile. Targeting of identified bioenergetic pathways by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis rescued motor axon defects in SMA zebrafish. Moreover, targeting of a single bioenergetic protein, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1), was found to modulate motor neuron vulnerability in vivo. Knockdown of pgk1 alone was sufficient to partially mimic the SMA phenotype in wild-type zebrafish. Conversely, Pgk1 overexpression, or treatment with terazosin (an FDA -approved small molecule that binds and activates Pgk1), rescued motor axon phenotypes in SMA zebrafish. We conclude that global bioenergetics pathways can be therapeutically manipulated to ameliorate SMA motor neuron phenotypes in vivo.",
  "28065172": "INCORPORATING ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES INTO A HEALTH ECONOMIC MODEL Traditional economic evaluations for most health technology assessments (HTAs) have previously not included environmental outcomes. With the growing interest in reducing the environmental impact of human activities, the need to consider how to include environmental outcomes into HTAs has increased. We present a simple method of doing so. We adapted an existing clinical - economic model to include environmental outcomes (carbon dioxide [CO2] emissions) to predict the consequences of adding insulin to an oral antidiabetic (OAD) regimen for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) over 30 years, from the United Kingdom payer perspective. Epidemiological, efficacy, healthcare costs, utility, and carbon emissions data were derived from published literature. A scenario analysis was performed to explore the impact of parameter uncertainty. The addition of insulin to an OAD regimen increases costs by 2,668 British pounds per patient and is associated with 0.36 additional quality-adjusted life-years per patient. The insulin - OAD combination regimen generates more treatment and disease management - related CO2 emissions per patient (1,686 kg) than the OAD -only regimen (310 kg), but generates fewer emissions associated with treating complications (3,019 kg versus 3,337 kg). Overall, adding insulin to OAD therapy generates an extra 1,057 kg of CO2 emissions per patient over 30 years. The model offers a simple approach for incorporating environmental outcomes into health economic analyses, to support a decision-maker's objective of reducing the environmental impact of health care. Further work is required to improve the accuracy of the approach; in particular, the generation of resource-specific environmental impacts.",
  "27753022": "Implementing Non-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis (NIPD) in a National Health Service Laboratory; From Dominant to Recessive Disorders Our UK National Health Service regional genetics laboratory offers NIPD for autosomal dominant and de novo conditions (achondroplasia, thanataphoric dysplasia, Apert syndrome), paternal mutation exclusion for cystic fibrosis and a range of bespoke tests. NIPD avoids the risks associated with invasive testing, making prenatal diagnosis more accessible to families at high genetic risk. However, the challenge remains in offering definitive diagnosis for autosomal recessive diseases, which is complicated by the predominance of the maternal mutant allele in the cell-free DNA sample and thus requires a variety of different approaches. Validation and diagnostic implementation for NIPD of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is further complicated by presence of a pseudogene that requires a different approach. We have used an assay targeting approximately 6700 heterozygous SNPs around the CAH gene (CYP21A2) to construct the high-risk parental haplotypes and tested this approach in five cases, showing that inheritance of the parental alleles can be correctly identified using NIPD. We are evaluating various measures of the fetal fraction to help determine inheritance of parental mutations. We are currently exploring the utility of an NIPD multi-disorder panel for autosomal recessive disease, to make testing more widely applicable to families with a variety of serious genetic conditions.",

Luminex assay of plasma cytokines and growth factors delineated a distinct biosignature in comorbid TBDM in this cohort. Transcriptional profiling revealed elements in common with published TB signatures from cohorts that excluded DM. Neutrophil count correlated with the molecular degree of perturbation, especially in TBDM patients. Body mass index and HDL cholesterol were negatively correlated with molecular degree of perturbation. Diabetic complication pathways including several pathways linked to epigenetic reprogramming were activated in TBDM above levels observed with DM alone. Our data provide a rationale for trials of host-directed therapies in TBDM, targeting neutrophilic inflammation and diabetic complication pathways to address the greater morbidity and mortality associated with this increasingly prevalent dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases.",
  "28389368": "Silk I and Silk II studied by fast scanning calorimetry Using fast scanning calorimetry (FSC), we investigated the glass transition and crystal melting of samples of B. mori silk fibroin containing Silk I and/or Silk II crystal s. Due to the very short residence times at high temperatures during such measurements, thermal decomposition of silk protein can be significantly suppressed. FSC was performed at 2000K/s using the Mettler Flash DSC1 on fibroin films with masses around 130-270ng. Films were prepared with different crystalline fractions (ranging from 0.26 to 0.50) and with different crystal structures (Silk I, Silk II, or mixed) by varying the processing conditions. These included water annealing at different temperatures, exposure to 50% MeOH in water, or autoclaving. The resulting crystal structure was examined using wide angle X-ray scattering. Degree of crystallinity was evaluated from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and from analysis of the heat capacity increment at the glass transition temperature. Silk fibroin films prepared by water annealing at 25°C were the least crystalline and had Silk I structure. FTIR and FSC studies showed that films prepared by autoclaving or 50% MeOH exposure were the most crystalline and had Silk II structure. Intermediate crystalline fraction and mixed Silk I / Silk II structure s were found in films prepared by water annealing at 37°C. FSC results indicate that Silk I I crystals exhibit endotherms of narrower width and have higher mean melting temperature Tm(II)=351±2.6°C, compared to Silk I crystals which melt at Tm(I)=292±3.8°C. Films containing mixed Silk I / Silk II structure showed two clearly separated endothermic peaks. Evidence suggests that the two types of crystal s melt separately and do not thermal ly interconvert on the extremely short time scale (0.065s between onset and end of melting) of the FSC experiment. Silkworm silk is a naturally occurring biomaterial. The fibroin component of silk forms two types of crystals. Silk properties depend upon the amount and type of crystals, and their stability. One measure of stability is crystal melting temperature. Crystal s which are more stable have a higher melting temperature. Until now, it has been challenging to study thermal behavior of silk crystal s because they degrade at high temperature. To avoid degradation, and study the melting properties of silk biomaterial, we heated silk at a very fast rate of 2000K/s using a special calorimeter. We have shown that the two crystal types have very different melting temperature s, indicating that one crystal type is much more stable than the other.",

In 16 cadaver knees, using o'clock method, centers of the ACL femoral footprint were drilled with an 8-mm reamer via an AAM portal (eight knees) or a high AM portal (eight knees). Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken of each knee. Three-dimensional (3D) models were constructed to identify the femoral tunnel orientation and to create femoral tunnel virtual cylinders for measuring tunnel angles and length. In two of the 16 specimens, we observed a posterior femoral cortex blowout (PFCB) when drilling through a high AM portal. When drilled through the high AM portal, the femoral tunnel length was significantly shorter than when using an AAM portal (30.3 ± 3.8 mm and 38.2 ± 3.1 mm, p < 0.001). The femoral tunnel length was significantly shorter in the group with PFCB compared to the group with no PFCB (25.9 ± 0.6 mm and 35.5 ± 4.5 mm, p = 0.011). The axial obliquity of the high AM portal was significantly higher than that of the AAM portal (52.2 ± 5.9° and 43.0 ± 2.3°, p = 0.003). In anatomic ACL reconstruction, a mal-positioned AM portal can cause abnormal tunnel orientation, which may lead to mechanical failure during ACL reconstruction. Therefore, it is important to select accurate AM portal positioning, and possibly using an AAM portal by measuring an accurate position when drilling a femoral tunnel in anatomic ACL reconstruction.",

In this study, it was found that 96% of Sagalla people are aware of the species, its habits and its association with soils high in organic matter. It was also found that 96% of Sagalla people use organic manure from cow dung in their farms. Habitat restoration through planting of indigenous plants was found to be ongoing, especially on compounds of public institutions as well as on private lands. Although drought was found to be a challenge for seedlings development especially on the low elevation sites, destruction by livestock especially during the dry season is also a major threat. In this study, it was recommended that any future habitat restoration initiative should include strong chain-link fencing to protect the seedlings from livestock activity. Recognizing that the preferred habitats for the species are in the valleys, systematic planting of keystone plant species such as fig trees (Ficus) creates the best microhabitats. These are better than general woodlots of indigenous trees.",
  "27667559": "Effects of an early intervention using human amniotic epithelial cells in a COPD rat model The study aimed to investigate the effect of an early intervention using human amniotic epithelial cell (hAEC) in a rat model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Twenty-four specific pathogen-free Wistar rats were randomized to the control, COPD, and COPD + hAEC groups. COPD was established by intratracheal LPS injection combined with smoke fumigation over 30 days. On the first day of model establishment rats in the AEC group also received intratracheal instillation of 500,000 hAECs isolated from the placenta of healthy donors. The mean linear intercept (MLI) and mean alveolar number (MAN) were used to assess the degree of lung emphysema. IL-8 was measured using a radioimmunoassay, surfactant protein D (SP-D) was measured by ELISA, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP8 expression was assessed by PCR. Smoke fumigation combined to LPS injection successfully established a COPD rat model with significant emphysema and airway inflammation, elevated MLI and MAN, elevated systemic and lung tissue levels of IL-8 and SP-D (P<0.05), and high expression of MMP2 and MMP8. Rats in the COPD + hAEC group exhibited alleviated lung damage, MLI and MAN (P<0.05), reduced systemic and lung tissue levels of IL-8 and SP-D (P<0.05) and MMP2 and MMP8 expression (P<0.05). Early intervention using hAECs could delay disease progression in rats with COPD.",
  "27792644": "Challenging Achievement of Bidirectional Block After Linear Ablation Affects the Rhythm Outcome in Patients With Persistent Atrial Fibrillation It is not clear whether bidirectional block (BDB) of linear ablations reduces atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after radiofrequency catheter ablation. We hypothesized that BDB of linear ablation has prognostic significance after radiofrequency catheter ablation for persistent AF. Among 1793 consecutive patients in the Yonsei AF ablation cohort, this observational cohort study included 398 patients with persistent AF (75.6% male; age, 59.8±10.3 years) who underwent catheter ablation with a consistent ablation protocol of the Dallas lesion set: circumferential pulmonary vein isolation; cavotricuspid isthmus ablation (CTI); roof line (RL); posterior-inferior line (PIL); and anterior line (AL). BDB rates of de novo ablation lines were 100% in circumferential pulmonary vein isolation, 100% in CTI, 84.7% in RL, 44.7% in PIL, and 63.6% in AL. During 29.0±18.4 months of follow-up, 31.7% (126/398) of the patients showed clinical recurrence. Left atrial posterior wall (LAPW) isolation (BDBs of RL and PIL) was independently associated with lower clinical AF / atrial tachycardia recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-0.98; P=0.041; log-rank, P=0.017), whereas BDBs of RL or AL were not (log-rank, P=0.178 for RL; P=0.764 for AL). Among 52 patients who underwent repeat procedures (23.0±16.1 months after de novo procedure), the BDB maintenance rates for CTI, RL, PIL, and AL were 94.2% (49 of 52), 63.5% (33 of 47), 62.1% (18 of 29), and 61.8% (21 of 34), respectively. Although PIL crosses the esophageal contact area, LAPW isolation is important for better clinical outcome in catheter ablation with a linear ablation strategy for patients with persistent AF.",
  "28322744": "Basal ryanodine receptor activity suppresses autophagic flux The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and intracellular Ca(2+) signaling are critically involved in regulating different steps of autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway. The ryanodine receptors (RyR), intracellular Ca(2+)-release channels mainly expressed in excitable cell types including muscle and neurons, have however not yet been extensively studied in relation to autophagy. Yet, aberrant expression and excessive activity of RyRs in these tissues has been implicated in the onset of several diseases including Alzheimer's disease, where impaired autophagy regulation contributes to the pathology. In this study, we determined whether pharmacological RyR inhibition could modulate autophagic flux in ectopic RyR - expressing models, like HEK293 cells and in cell types that endogenously express RyR s, like C2C12 myoblasts and primary hippocampal neurons. Importantly, RyR3 overexpression in HEK293 cells impaired the autophagic flux. Conversely, in all cell models tested, pharmacological inhibition of endogenous or ectopically expressed RyRs, using dantrolene or ryanodine, augmented autophagic flux by increasing lysosomal turn-over (number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes measured as mCherry - LC3 punctae / cell increased from 70.37±7.81 in control HEK RyR3 cells to 111.18±7.72 and 98.14±7.31 after dantrolene and ryanodine treatments, respectively). Moreover, in differentiated C2C12 cells, transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that dantrolene treatment decreased the number of early autophagic vacuoles from 5.9±2.97 to 1.8±1.03 per cellular cross section. The modulation of the autophagic flux could be linked to the functional inhibition of RyR channels as both RyR inhibitors efficiently diminished the number of cells showing spontaneous RyR3 activity in the HEK293 cell model (from 41.14%±2.12 in control cells to 18.70%±2.25 and 9.74%±2.67 after dantrolene and ryanodine treatments, respectively). In conclusion, basal RyR -mediated Ca(2+)-release events suppress autophagic flux at the level of the lysosomes.",
  "27468990": "Chitinibacter fontanus sp. nov., isolated from a spring A bacterial strain, designated STM-7T, was isolated from a spring in Taiwan and characterized using a polyphasic taxonomy approach. Cells of strain STM-7T were Gram-staining-negative, aerobic, poly--hydroxybutyrate -accumulating, motile by a single polar flagellum, rod-shaped that were surrounded by a thick capsule and forming milky white colored colonies. Growth occurred at 15-37 oC (optimum, 25-30 °C), at pH 6-8 (optimum, pH 6-7) and with 0-2 % NaCl (optimum, 0-1 %). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain STM-7T belonged to the genus Chitinibacter and was most closely related to Chitinibacter tainanensis S1T with sequence similarity of 97.3 %. Strain STM-7T contained summed feature 3 (comprising C16:17c and/or C16:16c) and C 16:0 as the predominant f atty acids. The major h ydroxyl fatty acids were C12:0 3-OH and C16:0 3-OH. The polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, an uncharacterized aminophospholipid, an uncharacterized glycolipid and an uncharacterized phospholipid. The major isoprenoid quinone was Q-8. The DNA G+C content of the genomic DNA was 52.4 mol%. The DNA-DNA hybridization value for strain STM-7T with Chitinibacter tainanensis S1T was less than 47 %. On the basis of the phylogenetic inference and phenotypic data, strain STM-7T should be classified as a novel species, for which the name Chitinibacter fontanus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is STM-7T (=BCRC 80923T =LMG 29289T =KCTC 42982T).",

A total of 150 samples were collected, including 33 needle aspirates from lymphoid tuberculosis, 23 needle aspirates from spinal tuberculosis, 49 from tuberculous pleural effusions, 24 from cerebrospinal fluid of tuberculous cephalomeningitis, and 21 urinary sediment samples from renal tuberculosis. Smear microscopy, mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and the MTB/RIF method were used to examine these samples and their positive rates were compared. Rifampin susceptibility tests was performed for culture-positive strains using proportion method, which was compared with the result from GeneXpert MTB/RIF method. Of the 150 cases of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, 17 samples were smear-positive, with a sensitivity of 11.3% (17/150); 30 were culture-positive with a sensitivity of 20.0% (30/150); and 96 were positive by MTB/RIF method with a sensitivity of 64.0% (96/150). There was a significant difference between MTB/RIF method and the culture method (χ(2)=59.61, P<0.01). The differences were also significant when the MTB/RIF method was compared with the smear method (χ(2)=88.60, P<0.01) or compared with culture plus smear methods (χ(2)=4.26, P<0.05). Separately, the differences were statistically significant between GeneXpert MTB/RIF method and other 2 methods for diagnosis of lymphoid tuberculosis (n=33, χ(2)=20.56, P<0.01 vs. culture method; χ(2)=27.13, P<0.01 vs. smear results) while no difference was found between culture and smear method (χ(2)=0.67, P>0.05), spinal tuberculosis (n=23, χ(2)=12.74, P<0.01 vs. culture method; χ(2)=14.81, P< 0.01 vs. smear method), tuberculous pleurisy (n=49, χ(2)=32.34, P<0.01 vs. culture method; χ(2)=49.69, P<0.01 vs. smear method) and renal tuberculosis (n=21, χ(2)=4.20, P<0.05 vs. culture method; χ(2) =8.40, P<0.01 vs. smear results). The sensitivity for tuberculous meningitis had no difference among these 3 methods (n=24, P>0.05). Rifampicin-resistance of the strains from the 30 culture-positive cases of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (20.0%, 6/30) exhibited agreement with GeneXpert MTB/RIF test.

A total of 300 one-day-old male Arbor Acre broiler chickens were randomly divided into four dietary treatments; the treatment diets were: Control (a basal diet containing normal peanut meal); AFB₁ (the basal diet containing AFB₁ - contaminated peanut meal); SSGL (basal diet with 200 mg/kg of SSGL); AFB₁ + SSGL (supplementation of 200 mg/kg of SSGL in AFB₁ diet). The contents of AFB₁ in AFB₁ and AFB₁ + SSGL diets were 25.0 μg/kg in the starter period and 22.5 μg/kg in the finisher period. The results showed that diet contaminated with a low level of AFB₁ significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the average daily feed intake and average daily gain during the entire experiment and reduced (p < 0.05) serum contents of total protein IgA and IgG. Furthermore, a dietary low level of AFB₁ not only increased (p < 0.05) levels of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation, but also decreased (p < 0.05) total antioxidant capability, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and hydroxyl radical scavenger activity in the liver and spleen of broilers. Moreover, the addition of SSGL to AFB₁ - contaminated diet counteracted these negative effects, indicating that SSGL has a protective effect against aflatoxicosis.",
  "28486935": "Emergency department use and barriers to wellness: a survey of emergency department frequent users There is no common understanding of how needs of emergency department (ED) frequent users differ from other patients. This study sought to examine how to best serve this population. Examinations of why ED frequent users present to the ED, what barriers to care exist, and what service offerings may help these patients achieve an optimal level of health were conducted. We performed a prospective study of frequent ED users in an adult only, level 1 trauma center with approximately 90,000 visits per year. Frequent ED users were defined as those who make four or more ED visits in a 12 month period. Participants were administered a piloted structured interview by a trained researcher querying demographics, ED usage, perceived barriers to care, and potential aids to maintaining health. Of 1,523 screened patients, 297 were identified as frequent ED users. One hundred frequent ED users were enrolled. The mean age was 48 years (95% CI 45-51). The majority of subjects were female (64%, 64/100, 95% CI 55-73%), white (61%, 60/98, 95% CI 52-71%) and insured by Medicaid (55%, 47/86, 95% CI 44-65%) or Medicare (23%, 20/86, 95% CI 14-32%). Subjects had a median of 6 ED visits, and 2 inpatient admissions in the past 12 months at this hospital. Most frequent ED users (61%, 59/96, 95% CI 52-71%) stated the primary reason for their visit was that they felt that their health problem could only be treated in an ED. Transportation presented as a major barrier to few patients (7%, 7/95, 95% CI 3-14%). Subjects stated that \" after-hours options, besides the ED for minor health issues \" (63%, 60/95, 95% CI 53-73%) and having \"a nurse to work with you one-on-one to help manage health care needs \" (53%, 50/95, 95% CI 43-63%) would be most helpful in achieving optimal health. This study characterized ED frequent users and identified several opportunities to better serve this population. By understanding barriers to care from the patient perspective, health systems can potentially address unmet needs that prevent wellness in this population.",

  "27614145": "Midodrine and tolvaptan in patients with cirrhosis and refractory or recurrent ascites: a randomised pilot study Splanchnic arterial vasodilatation and subsequent sodium and water retention play an important role in cirrhotic ascites. Midodrine and tolvaptan have been used separately in these patients. However, there are no reports on the use of combination of midodrine and tolvaptan in the control of ascites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of midodrine, tolvaptan and their combination in control of refractory or recurrent ascites in cirrhotics. Fifty cirrhotic patients with refractory or recurrent ascites were randomised to receive midodrine (n=13), tolvaptan (n=12) or both (n=13) plus standard medical therapy (SMT) or SMT alone (n=12). A significant increase in urinary volume and urinary sodium at 1 and 3 months (P<.05) was observed in all groups except SMT. There was no worsening of renal or hepatic function in any group. There was deterioration of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) in SMT. Midodrine as well as combination of midodrine and tolvaptan but not tolvaptan alone was superior to SMT in control of ascites at 3 months (P<.05). The combination therapy was also superior to midodrine in the control of ascites at 1 month. The morbidity and mortality were similar in all the groups except SMT. The results of this pilot study suggest that midodrine and combination with tolvaptan better controls ascites without any renal or hepatic dysfunction. The combination therapy rapidly controls ascites as compared to midodrine or tolvaptan alone.",
  "27481881": "Coffee - Antihypertensive Drug Interaction: A Hemodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Study With Felodipine A period of abstinence from coffee to permit caffeine elimination appears to enable increased blood pressure on subsequent exposure. We hypothesized that this would offset the antihypertensive effect of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker felodipine. A randomized, single-dose, crossover study assessed hemodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects following 2 days without coffee and caffeine - containing foods. Consistently brewed black coffee (2×300ml), felodipine maximum recommended dose (10mg), and coffee plus felodipine were tested in middle-aged normotensive subjects. Pretreatment plasma caffeine concentrations were unquantifiable. After coffee, blood pressure changes (mm Hg) averaged over study hours 1-4 were increased for brachial systolic (7.6, P < 0.001) and diastolic (4.9, P < 0.001) and aortic systolic (7.4, P < 0.001), pulse (3.0, P < 0.05) and augmentation (1.4, P < 0.05) relative to baseline. After coffee plus felodipine, they were higher for brachial systolic (4.0, P < 0.05) and diastolic (3.9, P < 0.001) and aortic systolic (4.6, P < 0.05) compared to felodipine alone. The pressor effects of coffee and its modulation by felodipine were variable among individuals. Coffee containing caffeine (127mg) caused maximum pressor effect. Caffeine and felodipine pharmacokinetics were similar for coffee and felodipine given alone or in combination indicating an interaction having a pharmacodynamic basis. Plasma felodipine concentration - diastolic blood pressure reduction relationship shifted with coffee such that doubling the felodipine concentration would eliminate the pressor effect. However, this may increase the risk of adverse drug events particularly during the timeframe without coffee. Intermittent coffee ingestion might complicate hypertension diagnosis and management for many individuals.",

Conditioned medium and direct cell-cell contacts experiments were used to investigate the effect of bone marrow -derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), osteoprogenitor-like cells (MG-63) and osteosarcoma cells (SaOS-2) on luminal-like (MCF-7) and basal-like (MDA-MB-231) BCCs flow cytometry was used to assess the purity of isolated BCCs and osteoblasts. Expression of osteoblastic markers was investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RANKL and OPG levels were measured by ELISA. Conditioned medium from MSCs and osteoblasts induced the expression of osteoblastic markers in BCCs. While co-culture assays with SaOS-2 increased the expression of osteoblastic markers in MCF-7 cells, SaOS-2 cell conditioned medium increased the expression of RANKL, PTHrP, VEGF and NOGGIN in MCF-7 cells. Co-cultures with either MG-63 cells or MSCs induced OPG and MMP-2 in both tumor cell lines. Interestingly, conditioned medium from co-cultures of MSCs and MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreased the proliferation of activated T lymphocytes which was reversed by addition of anti-OPG antibodies to the co-cultures. Our data suggest that MSCs strongly contribute to the adaptation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells in skeletal tissues.",
  "27286759": "Spatial analysis of drug poisoning deaths in the American West, particularly Utah Most states in the Western US have high rates of drug poisoning death (DPD), especially New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and Utah (UT). This seems paradoxical in UT where illicit drug use, smoking and drinking rates are low. To investigate this, spatial analysis of county level DPD data and other relevant factors in the Western US and UT was undertaken. Poisson kriging was used to smooth the DPD data, populate data gaps and improve the reliability of rates recorded in sparsely populated counties. Links between DPD and economic, environmental, health, lifestyle, and demographic factors were investigated at four scales using multiple linear regression. LDS church membership and altitude, factors not previously considered, were included. Spatial change in the strength and sign of relationships was investigated using geographically weighted regression and significant DPD clusters were identified using the Local Moran's I. Economic factors, like the sharp social gradient between rural and urban areas were important to DPD throughout the west. Higher DPD rates were also found in areas of higher elevation and the desert rural areas in the south. The unique characteristics of DPD in UT in terms of health and lifestyle factors, as well as the demographic structure of DPD in the most LDS populous states (UT, Idaho, Wyoming), suggest that high DPD in heavily LDS areas are predominantly prescription opioid related whereas in other Western states a larger proportion of DPD might come from illicit drugs. Drug policies need to be adapted to the geographical differences in the dominant type of drug causing death. Educational materials need to be marketed to the demographic groups at greatest risk and take into account differences in population characteristics between and within States. Some suggestions about how such adaptations can be made are given and future research needs outlined.",

We report a rare case of bilateral pneumothoraces resulting from tracheostomy in an advanced laryngeal cancer patient. A 59-year-old man was referred to our clinic for evaluation and treatment of laryngeal tumor. Laryngeal endoscopy showed limited movement of bilateral vocal cords, and computed tomography revealed a tumor lesion extending from the vocal cords to the subglottic area. Three days after the first visit, the patient developed respiratory difficulty, and we elected to perform emergency tracheostomy for airway management. Immediately after the start of the procedure, he began hyperventilating, and complained of respiratory discomfort and chest pain. We then recognized a mediastinal air leak, and we suspected pneumothorax resulting from the tracheostomy. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pneumothoraces; therefore, we inserted bilateral chest drainage tubes, which stabilized his respiratory condition. We speculated that the pathogenesis of the bilateral pneumothoraces was weakened alveolar walls secondary to long-term smoking, and a significant rise in airway pressure because of airway constriction by the neck-extended position and hyperventilation, during tracheostomy.",

Older adults learned 13 nonwords and were tested on their memory for the nonwords, and on whether these nonwords impacted upon processing of similar-sounding English words immediately and 24 hours later. Participants accurately recognized the nonwords immediately, but showed significant decreases in delayed recognition and recall. In comparison, the nonwords impacted upon processing of similar-sounding words only in the delayed test. Together, these findings suggest that memory consolidation processes may be more evident in item integration than memory stabilization processes for new declarative memories in older adults.",

This study aimed at evaluating the incidence, reasons, and potential risk factors for reintervention. Studies reporting reintervention after endovascular repair were identified by searching PubMed and Embase in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, and by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved articles. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analyses were performed to determine the sources of heterogeneity. Funnel plot and Egger's test were used to determine the publication bias. A total of 27 studies encompassing 2403 patients with aortic dissection were identified. The pooled incidence of reintervention after endovascular repair was 15% (95% confidence interval, 12-19) during 33.7 months of follow-up. The 3 most common reasons for reintervention were endoleak (33.2%), false lumen perfusion and aortic dilation (19.8%), and new dissection (6.9%). The potential factors for reintervention were the mean age of onset and diabetes mellitus determined by performing a single meta-regression analysis (P < .001 and .044, respectively). Current data suggest that the incidence of reintervention after endovascular therapy is relatively high during midterm follow-up. Advanced age of onset is a risk factor and diabetes mellitus is a protective factor of reintervention after endovascular therapy. The possible mechanism that diabetes mellitus protects patients from reintervention should be explored further.",

  "28153991": "Sex -Based Differences in Cardiometabolic Biomarkers Few data are available comparing cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarker profiles between women and men in the general population. We analyzed sex -based differences in multiple biomarkers reflecting distinct pathophysiological pathways, accounting for differences between women and men in CVD risk factors, body composition, and cardiac morphology. A cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from the Dallas Heart Study, a multiethnic population-based study. Associations between sex and 30 distinct biomarkers representative of 6 pathophysiological categories were evaluated using multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, race, traditional CVD risk factors, kidney function, insulin resistance, MRI and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measures of body composition and fat distribution, and left ventricular mass. After excluding participants with CVD, the study population included 3439 individuals, mean age 43 years, 56% women, and 52% black. Significant sex -based differences were seen in multiple categories of biomarkers, including lipids, adipokines, and biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, myocyte injury and stress, and kidney function. In fully adjusted models, women had higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein particle concentration, leptin, d-dimer, homoarginine, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, adiponectin, lipoprotein - associated phospholipase A2 mass and activity, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, soluble endothelial cell adhesion molecule, symmetrical dimethylarginine, asymmetrical dimethylarginine, high-sensitivity troponin T, and cystatin C. Biomarker profiles differ significantly between women and men in the general population. Sex differences were most apparent for biomarkers of adiposity, endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory cell recruitment, and cardiac stress and injury. Future studies are needed to characterize whether pathophysiological processes delineated by these biomarkers contribute to sex -based differences in the development and complications of CVD.",
  "27285494": "Parasympathetic Activity and Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness in Athletes A high prevalence of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is reported in swimmers and cross-country skiers. It has been suggested that increased parasympathetic nervous activity is involved in asthma development in endurance athletes. We aimed to assess the associations of BHR to parasympathetic activity in healthy and asthmatic swimmers and cross-country skiers and healthy non athletes. Parasympathetic activity was measured by pupillometry and heart rate variability at the onset of exercise with the cardiac vagal index calculated in 28 cross-country skiers (♂18/♀10), 29 swimmers (♂17/♀12), and 30 healthy nonathlete controls (♂14/♀16) on two different days. All subjects performed a methacholine bronchial challenge with the provocation dose causing 20% decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s calculated (PD20met). Data were analyzed by robust regression analysis and presented as β coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CI). PD20met was negatively associated with cardiac vagal index (-13.9, 95% CI = -26.8 to -1.0) in all subjects. When adjusted to the type of sport, this association was stronger in swimmers (-8.3, 95% CI = -13.0 to -3.6) as compared with controls and nonsignificant in cross-country skiers. Percent pupil constriction was significantly associated with PD20met in swimmers (-9.4, 95% CI = -15.4 to -3.4) only after adjusting for the type of sport. Fourteen swimmers (48%) and 16 cross-country skiers (57%) had doctor-diagnosed asthma in combination with current BHR and/or current use of asthma drugs. Seventy-two percent swimmers, 44% cross-country skiers, and 39% controls had a PD20met ≤8 μmol (P = 0.015). Fourteen swimmers had a PD20met ≤2 μmol as compared with one cross-country skier (P < 0.001). Parasympathetic activity measured in the heart is more closely related to BHR as compared with parasympathetic activity measured in the pupils. The type of sport influences BHR severity and its relationship to parasympathetic activity.",
  "28110694": "Tourette syndrome in the context of evolution and behavioral ecology Tourette syndrome, and the closely related spectrum of tic disorders, are inherited neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by the presence of repetitive and stereotyped movements. Tics are elicited by either environmental experiences or internal signals that instruct the basal ganglia to initiate automatic or procedural movements. In most vertebrates the basal ganglia encode instructions for habitually used sequences of motor movements that are essential to survival. Tic disorders may represent evolved phenotypes with a lower threshold for basal ganglia -directed actions. This may have produced a susceptibility to extraneous tics, but also produced fast-acting tactical solutions to immediate physical problems. During periods of nonstop movement, continual foraging, and sustained vigilance, it may have been advantageous to allow subcortical motor commands to intrude into ongoing motor activities. It is clear that the engrams for individual motor responses held in the basal ganglia are selected by converging cortical and subcortical inputs. This form of convergent action selection results in the selection of the most contextually reinforced actions. Today people with Tourette's have tics that seem arbitrary and inappropriate; however, this may be due to the vast discrepancies in reinforcement between the ancestral environment and the modern one. In prehistoric environments, the motor behaviors of individuals with tic disorders may have been appropriate in environmental context, and had ecological relevance in survival and self-promotion.",
  "28118389": "Rapid Design of Knowledge-Based Scoring Potentials for Enrichment of Near - Native Geometries in Protein-Protein Docking Protein-protein docking protocols aim to predict the structures of protein-protein complexes based on the structure of individual partners. Docking protocols usually include several steps of sampling, clustering, refinement and re-scoring. The scoring step is one of the bottlenecks in the performance of many state-of-the-art protocols. The performance of scoring functions depends on the quality of the generated structures and its coupling to the sampling algorithm. A tool kit, GRADSCOPT (GRid Accelerated Directly SCoring OPTimizing), was designed to allow rapid development and optimization of different knowledge-based scoring potentials for specific objectives in protein-protein docking. Different atomistic and coarse-grained potentials can be created by a grid-accelerated directly scoring dependent Monte-Carlo annealing or by a linear regression optimization. We demonstrate that the scoring functions generated by our approach are similar to or even outperform state-of-the-art scoring functions for predicting near - native solutions. Of additional importance, we find that potentials specifically trained to identify the native bound complex perform rather poorly on identifying acceptable or medium quality (near - native) solutions. In contrast, atomistic long-range contact potentials can increase the average fraction of near - native poses by up to a factor 2.5 in the best scored 1% decoys (compared to existing scoring), emphasizing the need of specific docking potentials for different steps in the docking protocol.",

As part of a statewide practice management program, therapist completed monthly reports of treatment targets (up to 10 per month) for a sample of youth (n = 790) receiving intensive in-home therapy. Nearly 75 % of youth were diagnosed with multiple co-occurring disorders. Five factors emerged: Disinhibition, Societal Rules Evasion, Social Engagement Deficits, Emotional Distress, and Management of Biodevelopmental Outcomes. Using logistic regression, primary diagnosis predicted therapist selection of Disinhibition and Emotional Distress targets. Client age predicted endorsement of Societal Rules Evasion targets.

  "28322352": "Gene -based genome-wide association study identified 19p13.3 for lean body mass Lean body mass (LBM) is a complex trait for human health. To identify genomic loci underlying LBM, we performed a gene -based genome-wide association study of lean mass index (LMI) in 1000 unrelated Caucasian subjects, and replicated in 2283 unrelated Caucasians subjects. Gene -based association analyses highlighted the significant associations of three genes UQCR, TCF3 and MBD3 in one single locus 19p13.3 (discovery p = 6.10 × 10(-5), 1.65 × 10(-4) and 1.10 × 10(-4); replication p = 2.21 × 10(-3), 1.84 × 10(-3) and 6.95 × 10(-3); combined p = 2.26 × 10(-6), 4.86 × 10(-6) and 1.15 × 10(-5), respectively). These results, together with the known functional relevance of the three genes to LMI, suggested that the 19p13.3 region containing UQCR, TCF3 and MBD3 genes was a novel locus underlying lean mass variation.",
  "27928742": "Implementation of infrared and Raman modalities for glycosaminoglycan characterization in complex systems Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are natural, linear and negatively charged heteropolysaccharides which are incident in every mammalian tissue. They consist of repeating disaccharide units, which are composed of either sulfated or non-sulfated monosaccharides. Depending on tissue types, GAGs exhibit structural heterogeneity such as the position and degree of sulfation or within their disaccharide units composition being heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitine sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. They are covalently linked to a core protein (proteoglycans) or as free chains (hyaluronan). GAGs affect cell properties and functions either by direct interaction with cell receptors or by sequestration of growth factors. These evidences of divert biological roles of GAGs make their characterization at cell and tissue levels of importance. Thus, non-invasive techniques are interesting to investigate, to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize GAGs in vitro in order to use them as diagnostic biomarkers and/or as therapeutic targets in several human diseases including cancer. Infrared and Raman microspectroscopies and imaging are sensitive enough to differentiate and classify GAG types and subtypes in spite of their close molecular structures. Spectroscopic markers characteristic of reference GAG molecules were identified. Beyond these investigations of the standard GAG spectral signature, infrared and Raman spectral signatures of GAG were searched in complex biological systems like cells. The aim of the present review is to describe the implementation of these complementary vibrational spectroscopy techniques, and to discuss their potentials, advantages and disadvantages for GAG analysis. In addition, this review presents new data as we show for the first time GAG infrared and Raman spectral signatures from conditioned media and live cells, respectively.",

In this in vivo clinical trial, 20 patients who needed endodontic retreatment were selected. After conventional chemo mechanical preparation of root canals, microbiological samples were taken with sterile paper point (PP), held in thioglycollate broth, and then were transferred to the microbiological lab. In the first group, PDT with methylene blue (MB) and diode laser (810 nm, 0.2 W, 40 seconds) was performed and in the second group diode laser (810 nm, 1.2 W, 30 seconds) was irradiated. Then second samples were taken from all canals. CFU/ml amounts showed statistically significant reduction in both groups (P < 0.001). CFU/ml amounts were compared between the two groups and there was no statistical difference. PDT and diode laser 810 nm irradiation are effective methods for root canal disinfection. PDT is a suitable alternative for diode laser 810 nm irradiation, because of lower thermal risk on root dentin.",
  "27871881": "Targeting brain and peripheral plasticity of the lipidome in acute kainic acid - induced epileptic seizures in mice via quantitative mass spectrometry Epilepsy is a highly common chronic neurological disorder, manifested in many different types, affecting ~1% of the worldwide human population. The molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis have not yet been clarified, and pharmacoresistance exhibited by 30-40% of epilepsy patients remains a major obstacle in medical care. Growing evidence indicates a role of lipid signalling pathways in epileptogenesis, thus lipid signals emerge as potential biomarkers for the onset and evolving course of the epileptic disorder, as well as potential therapeutic agents and targets. For this purpose, we applied a lipidomic strategy to unravel lipid alterations in brain regions, periphery tissues and plasma that are specific for acute epileptic seizures in mice at 1h after seizure induction by systemic kainic acid injection as compared to vehicle controls. Specifically, levels of (i) selected phospholipids and sphingomyelins, (ii) the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), and the endocannabinoid -related compounds oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), (iii) arachidonic acid (AA), (iv) selected eicosanoids, and (v) fatty acyl content of lipidome were determined in pulverized tissues from six brain regions of kainic acid induced epileptic seizure models and vehicle controls: hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum and cerebral cortex, and from peripheral organs, such as heart and lungs, and in plasma. Alterations in lipid levels after acute epileptic seizures as compared to non-seizure controls were found to be brain region - and periphery tissue - specific, including specific plasma lipid correlates, highlighting their value as marker candidates in translational research studies, and/or drug discovery and response monitoring.",
  "27477569": "Intravascular Inflammation Triggers Intracerebral Activated Microglia and Contributes to Secondary Brain Injury After Experimental Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (eSAH) Activation of innate immunity contributes to secondary brain injury after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (eSAH). Microglia accumulation and activation within the brain has recently been shown to induce neuronal cell death after eSAH. In isolated mouse brain capillaries after eSAH, we show a significantly increased gene expression for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and P-selectin. Hence, we hypothesized that extracerebral intravascular inflammatory processes might initiate the previously reported microglia accumulation within the brain tissue. We therefore induced eSAH in knockout mice for ICAM-1 (ICAM-1(-/-)) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1(-/-)) to find a significant decrease in neutrophil - endothelial interaction within the first 7 days after the bleeding in a chronic cranial window model. This inhibition of neutrophil recruitment to the endothelium results in significantly ameliorated microglia accumulation and neuronal cell death in knockout animals in comparison to controls. Our results suggest an outside-in activation of the CNS innate immune system at the vessel / brain interface following eSAH. Microglia cells, as part of the brain's innate immune system, are triggered by an inflammatory reaction in the microvasculature after eSAH, thus contributing to neuronal cell death. This finding offers a whole range of new research targets, as well as possible therapy options for patients suffering from eSAH.",
  "28101973": "Heparin cross-linked collagen sponge scaffolds improve functional regeneration of rat tracheal epithelium Tracheal epithelial cells maintain airway homeostasis by mediating mucociliary clearance. Following tracheal reconstruction, timely epithelial regeneration is required to prevent respiratory compromise and infectious diseases. To achieve rapid tracheal epithelial regeneration, a heparin cross-linked collagen sponge containing fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was prepared as a graft for tracheal reconstruction. The heparin cross-linked sponge exhibited a high FGF-2 retaining capacity, and tracheal epithelial and mesenchymal cells cultured in this sponge containing FGF-2 showed high proliferative capacities. Subsequently, heparin -free collagen sponge scaffolds (C/F scaffold) and collagen sponge scaffolds cross-linked with 10 μg/ml heparin retained FGF-2 (C/H10/F scaffold), and were transplanted into rats with tracheal defects. Invasion of both epithelial and non-epithelial cells was greater in rats treated with the C/H10/F scaffold at 1 week post- transplantation than in rats treated with the C/F scaffold. Moreover, at 2 weeks after transplantation, improved cilia formation was observed in the C/H10/F scaffold group, with higher motility and more potent posterior-anterior flow generation than in the C/F scaffold group. These results suggest that heparin improves functional regeneration of tracheal epithelium. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
  "27920636": "Identifying CNVs in 15q11q13 and 16p11.2 of Patients with Seizures Increases the Rates of Detecting Pathogenic Changes Chromosomal changes are frequently observed in patients with syndromic seizures. Understanding the genetic etiology of this pathology is crucial for the guidance and genetic counseling of families as well as for the establishment of appropriate treatment. A combination of MLPA kits was used to identify pathogenic CNVs in a group of 70 syndromic patients with seizures. Initially, a screening was performed for subtelomeric changes (MLPA P036 and P070 kits) and for the regions most frequently related to microdeletion / microduplication syndromes (MLPA P064). Subsequently, the MLPA P343 was used to identify alterations in the 15q11q13, 16p11.2, and 22q13 regions. Screening with MLPA P343 allowed a 10-15.7% increase in the detection rate of CNVs reinforcing the importance of investigating changes in 15q11q13 and 16p11.2 in syndromic patients with seizures. We also demonstrated that the MLPA technique is an alternative with a great diagnostic potential, and we proposed its use as part of the initial assessment of syndromic patients with seizures.",
  "28203067": "Silent strain of caregiving: exploring the best predictors of distress in family carers of geriatric patients The aim of this article was to identify the best predictors of distress suffered by family carers (FCs) of geriatric patients. A cross-sectional study of 100 FC - geriatric patient dyads was conducted. The negative impact of care (NIoC) subscale of the COPE index was dichotomized to identify lower stress (score of ≤15 on the scale) and higher stress (score of ≥16 on the scale) exerted on FCs by the process of providing care. The set of explanatory variables comprised a wide range of sociodemographic and care-related attributes, including patient-related results from comprehensive geriatric assessments and disease profiles. The best combination of explanatory variables that provided the highest predictive powe r for distress among FCs in the multiple logistic regression (LR) model was determined according to statistical information criteria. The statistical robustness of the observed relationships and the discriminative power of the model were verified with the cross-validation method. The mean age of FCs was 57.2 (±10.6) years, whereas that of geriatric patients was 81.7 (±6.4) years. Despite the broad initial set of potential explanatory variables, only five predictors were jointly selected for the best statistical model. A higher level of distress was independently predicted by lower self-evaluation of health; worse self-appraisal of coping well as a caregiver; lower sense of general support; more hours of care per week; and the motor retardation of the cared -for person measured with the speed of the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Worse performance on the TUG test was only the patient -related predictor of distress among the variables examined as contributors to the higher NIoC. Enhancing the mobility of geriatric patients through suitably tailored kinesitherapeutic methods during their hospital stay may mitigate the burden endured by FCs.",
  "28299515": "The influence of slope on Spartium junceum root system: morphological, anatomical and biomechanical adaptation Root systems have a pivotal role in plant anchorage and their mechanical interactions with the soil may contribute to soil reinforcement and stabilization of slide-prone slopes. In order to understand the responses of root system to mechanical stress induced by slope, samples of Spartium junceum L., growing in slope and in plane natural conditions, were compared in their morphology, biomechanical properties and anatomical features. Soils sampled in slope and plane revealed similar characteristics, with the exception of organic matter content and penetrometer resistance, both higher in slope. Slope significantly influenced root morphology and in particular the distribution of lateral roots along the soil depth. Indeed, first-order lateral roots of plants growing on slope condition showed an asymmetric distribution between up- and down-slope. Contrarily, this asymmetric distribution was not observed in plants growing in plane. The tensile strength was higher in lateral roots growing up-slope and in plane conditions than in those growing down-slope. Anatomical investigations revealed that, while roots grown up-slope had higher area covered by xylem fibers, the ratio of xylem and phloem fibers to root diameter did not differ among the three conditions, as also, no differences were found for xylem fiber cell wall thickness. Roots growing up-slope were the main contributors to anchorage properties, which included higher strength and higher number of fibers in the xylematic tissues. Results suggested that a combination of root - specific morphological, anatomical and biomechanical traits, determines anchorage functions in slope conditions.",

Treatment of OA is largely palliative based on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids and injections of steroids. Regarding conservative treatment, intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid (HA) can play a role in early symptomatic knee OA. Between August 2015 and September 2015, sixty patients (32 males and 28 females) between 40 and 70 years old were randomly allocated into two groups: Half were treated with three weekly intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid 1.6 % (group A), while the others were treated with Syalox 300 Plus(®) (hyaluronic acid 300 mg + Boswellia serrata extract 100 mg) 1 tab / die for 20 days and afterward Syalox 150(®) (hyaluronic acid 150 mg) 1 tab / die for other 20 days (group B). All patients were evaluated clinically with American Knee Society Score (AKSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) for the pain before the treatment and after 3 months. AKSS of the patients in both groups was significantly increased by the treatment, and VAS score was significantly reduced. In both groups, two subgroups were created with patients older than 60 years and patients younger than 60 years. Better results are reported in younger patients of group A and older subjects in group B. Despite several limitations, the results of the study have shown that HA injection and oral administration may have beneficial therapeutic effects on patients with early osteoarthritis. Different outcomes in younger and older subject suggested a combined therapy first with local infiltrations and then with oral composition.",
  "27938921": "Night-waking trajectories and associated factors in French preschoolers from the EDEN birth-cohort Night waking in preschoolers has been associated with adverse health outcomes in cross-sectional studies, but has rarely been analyzed in a longitudinal setting. Therefore, little is known about the evolution of night waking in early childhood. The objectives of the present study were: to identify night-waking trajectories in preschoolers, and to examine the risk factors associated with those trajectories. Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN, which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Data on a child's night waking at the ages of two, three, and five, six years, and potential confounders, were collected through parental self-reported questionnaires. Night-waking trajectories were computerized using group-based trajectory modeling on 1346 children. Two distinct developmental patterns were identified: the \"2-5 rare night-waking \" (77% of the children) and the \"2-5 common night-waking \" pattern. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors associated with the trajectories. Risk factors for belonging to the \"2-5 common night-waking \" trajectory were: exposure to passive smoking at home, daycare in a collective setting, watching television for extended periods, bottle feeding at night, high emotionality, and low shyness. This approach allowed identification of risk factors associated with night waking during a critical age window, and laid the groundwork for identifying children at higher risk of deleterious sleep patterns. Those risk factors were mainly living habits, which indicated that prevention and intervention programs could be highly beneficial in this population.",

Though clinical supervision is advocated by most educational and governing institutions, the effects of clinical supervision on the supervisees ' competence, e.g., attitudes, behaviors, and skills, as well as on treatment outcomes and other patient variables are debated and largely unknown. Evidence-based practice is advocated in clinical settings but has not yet been fully implemented in educational or clinical training settings. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize and present the empirical literature regarding effects of clinical supervision in cognitive-behavioral therapy. This study will include a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that have empirically investigated the effects of supervision on supervised psychotherapists and/or the supervisees' patients. A comprehensive search strategy will be conducted to identify published controlled studies indexed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases. Data on supervision outcomes in both psychotherapists and their patients will be extracted, synthesized, and reported.

  "27771058": "Involvement of NF-κB in regulation of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae exotoxin ApxI -induced proinflammatory cytokine production in porcine alveolar macrophages Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a crucial respiratory pathogen that causes fibrinous, hemorrhagic, necrotizing pleuropneumonia in pigs. A. pleuropneumoniae exotoxins (ApxI to IV) are the major virulence factors contributing to A. pleuropneumoniae pathogenesis. Previously, we demonstrated that ApxI induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) via the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and cJun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Nonetheless, the role of nuclear factor (NF)-κB -a transcription factor widely implicated in immune and inflammatory responses -in ApxI -elicited cytokine production has yet to be defined. In the present study, we examined the involvement of NF-κB in ApxI -elicited production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in PAMs and investigated the correlation between NF-κB and MAPK (p38 and JNK) pathways in this event. The results of Western blot analysis, confocal microscopy, and a DNA binding activity assay revealed that the classical NF-κB pathway was activated by ApxI, as evidenced by the decreased levels of IκB and subsequent NF-κB translocation and activation in ApxI -stimulated PAMs. Moreover, the blocking of ApxI -induced NF-κB activation significantly attenuated the levels of mRNA and protein secretion of IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α in PAMs. Notably, the attenuation of JNK activation by a specific inhibitor (SP600125) reduced ApxI -induced NF-κB activation, whereas a p38 blocker (SB203580) had no effect on the NF-κB pathway. Further examination revealed that the level of phosphorylation at serine 536 on the NF-κB p65 subunit was dependent on JNK activity. Collectively, this study, for the first time, demonstrates a pivotal role of NF-κB in ApxI -induced IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α production; JNK, but not p38, may positively affect the activation of the classical NF-κB pathway.",
  "27921269": "Graded Structure in Sexual Definitions: Categorizations of Having \" Had Sex \" and Virginity Loss Among Homosexual and Heterosexual Men and Women Definitions of sexual behavior display a robust hierarchy of agreement regarding whether or not acts should be classed as, for example, sex or virginity loss. The current research offers a theoretical explanation for this hierarchy, proposing that sexual definitions display graded categorical structure, arising from goodness of membership judgments. Moderation of this graded structure is also predicted, with the focus here on how sexual orientation identity affects sexual definitions. A total of 300 18- to 30- year -old participants completed an online survey, rating 18 behaviors for how far each constitutes having \" had sex \" and virginity loss. Participants fell into one of four groups: heterosexual male or female, gay male or lesbian. The predicted ratings hierarchy emerged, in which bidirectional genital acts were rated significantly higher than unidirectional or nonpenetrative contact, which was in turn rated significantly higher than acts involving no genital contact. Moderation of graded structure was also in line with predictions. Compared to the other groups, the lesbian group significantly upgraded ratings of genital contact that was either unidirectional or nonpenetrative. There was also evidence of upgrading by the gay male sample of anal intercourse ratings. These effects are theorized to reflect group -level variation in experience, contextual perspective, and identity -management. The implications of the findings in relation to previous research are discussed. It is suggested that a graded structure approach can greatly benefit future research into sexual definitions, by permitting variable definitions to be predicted and explained, rather than merely identified.",

The Nallampatti noncommunicable disease study To assess the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases in a true rural farming population in South India and compare the data with the landmark contemporary Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study. Local Ethics Committee approval and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Inclusion criteria were participants, aged ≥20 and ≤85 years, from Nallampatti, a classical farming village from Tamil Nadu state, India. All participants were administered a detailed questionnaire, had anthropometric measurements including height, weight, and waist circumference. Bloods were drawn for random blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), nonfasting lipid profile, Cystatin C, uric acid, and hemoglobin. All participants had carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) done by high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasound. More than 50% of the population had either diabetes or prediabetes based on HbA1c. Nearly, 40% of the population had hypertension with suboptimal control in those with known hypertension. Nearly, a third of the population had dyslipidemia, elevated cystatin C levels, and abnormal CIMT. The burden was higher than the comparable ICMR-INDIAB study in rural Tamil Nadu. One-third to one-half of this rural farming population is at risk of cardiovascular disease, with poor control of preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Current Indian data may underestimate the risk in different ethnic populations and regions of India. Long-term follow-up of this cohort for the incident cardiovascular disease will shed light on the true cardiovascular risk in a typical South Indian rural farming population.",
  "27779702": "Extract of Caulis Spatholobi, a novel blocker targeting tumor cell ‑induced platelet aggregation, inhibits breast cancer metastasis Metastasis of breast cancer is the vital step for malignant progression. During such a process, hematogenous metastasis is an indispensable approach for the dissemination of cancer cells. A platelet, contributes to hypercoagulable state, and is also identified the crucial factor in the coagulation system for supporting metastasis. Therefore, the relationship of a platelet and a tumor cell plays a critical role in tumor cell metastasis. Consequently, inhibiting tumor cell ‑induced platelet aggregation (TCIPA) is recongnized as a crucial target on suppression of tumor metastasis such as aspirin (ASA). Under such circumstance, here we report that, through dissociating the tumor‑platelet (T‑P) complex, 80% ethanol extracts of Caulis Spatholobi (SET) successfully alleviated the hypercoagulation state, thereby reducing tumor metastasis and improving the prospects of survival in breast cancer cell model. Through MTT and anti‑aggregation assay stimulated by ADP, we detected the optimum treatment time and the optimum dose of SET. By using confocal microscopy, we observed that SET can strongly block the formation of T‑P complex i n vitro. The result was further quantified and confirmed by the FACS analysis. The fluorescent value of T‑P complex was obviously decreased in the drug‑treated groups. In vivo, 4T1 cells were injected through the mouse tail vein for dynamic visualization by small animal imaging system. The metastatic intensity was quantified and the survival curve was analyzed. Additionally, general observation and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of lung tissue was performed. SET exerted an obvious effect on the inhibition of metastasis and increasing the survival rate of mice. For the molecular mechanism study of anti‑TCIPA, zymography and R T‑PCR assay preliminarily revealed the molecular mechanism of SET in the regulation of P ‑T interaction. Collectively, through drug efficacy identification and pharmacological revealing, we have obtained a promising candidate for the interference of breast metastasis by suppressing TCIPA, which will be beneficial for clinical cancer treatment.",

Our modeling process is based on a generic patient atlas to start with. It is defined by organ - specific optimized models, method modules and parameters, i.e. mainly individual segmentation masks, transfer functions to fill the gaps between the masks and intensity image data. In this contribution, we show how generic patient atlases can be generalized to new patient data. The methodology consists of patient - specific, locally-adaptive transfer functions and dedicated modeling methods such as multi-atlas segmentation, vessel filtering and spline-modeling. Our full image volume segmentation algorithm yields median DICE coefficients of 0.98, 0.93, 0.82, 0.74, 0.51 and 0.48 regarding soft-tissue, liver, bone, skin, blood and bile vessels for ten test patients and three selected reference patients. Compared to standard slice-wise manual contouring time saving is remarkable. Our segmentation process shows out efficiency and robustness for upper abdominal puncture simulation systems. This marks a significant step toward establishing patient - specific training and hands-on planning systems in a clinical environment.",
  "27653173": "Percutaneous coronary intervention and heart surgery learning needs of patients in Jordan This study aimed to identify and prioritize the perceived learning needs of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention or open-heart surgery. Identifying learning needs for post-cardiac intervention patients is essential to establish successful health education programmes based on patient central care. A descriptive comparative design was employed on a convenience sample of 260 patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention and 105 patients who underwent open-heart surgery patients. Participants had completed the Patient Learning Needs Scale. Data were collected between 1 October 2014 and 31 June 2015. Patients from the two groups highly requesting health and recovery related information. They scored all learning need topics as important or highly important for them. The top priority learning need for both patient groups was ' information about wound care ', and the lowest priority learning need topic was ' physical activity '. The learning needs of both groups were very close, which indicated that educational secondary prevention programmes ' content can be prepared in a unified structure for those patients. Although, specific headings can be used to address the unique needs that emerge from having a specific cardiac interventional procedure. The fact that wound care and medications are areas of highest learning needs for patients requires health policy decision makers to address these topics at the time of hospital discharge. In addition, a policy focus on considering patients ' actual learning needs requires establishment and managerial support. As patients ' learning needs might change later after discharge, the health services should be proactive and focus on continuous support for patients after hospital discharge. Secondary prevention programmes should incorporate health education topics based on patients ' own views. This can be done by giving higher priority to understand patients' needs, put much more effort into how to meet patients ' information needs and to create a more engaging learning environment for patients and their families.",

Three-layer architecture was developed by deposition of polydopamine (PDA) and electro-deposition of N-O-sulfonic acid benzyl chitosan (NSBC). The innermost and outermost layers were PDA with different deposition time. The middle layer was prepared by NSBC. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy confirmed that PDA and NSBC were successfully modified on the surfaces of AEMs. The contact angle of the membranes indicated an improved hydrophilicity of the modified membranes. A series of electrodialysis experiments in which Cl(-) / SO4(2-) separation was studied, demonstrating the monovalent anion selectivity of the samples. The Cl(-) / SO4(2-) permselectivity of the modified membranes can reach up to 2.20, higher than that of the commercial membrane (only 0.78) during 90 minutes in electrodialysis (ED). The increase value of the resistance of the membranes was also measured to evaluate the antifouling properties. Sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) was used as the fouling material in the ED process and the membrane area resistance of modified membrane increase value of was only 0.08 Ωcm(2) 30 minutes later.",

Using the UK-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink we identified 9778 newly diagnosed GCA patients in 1990-2014, and up to 10 non-vasculitis patients randomly matched to each case on age, sex, practice and years of history before cohort entry. We compared the distributions of 9 different pre-existing vascular diseases and 11 other comorbidities, and risks of incident vascular diseases and other comorbidities after cohort entry between GCA and non-vasculitis patients. Patients with GCA were more likely to have a history of vascular diseases and other comorbidities except myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer, compared with non-vasculitis patients. Patients with GCA had increased risks for all types of incident vascular disease compared with non-vasculitis patients: adjusted hazard ratios were 1.57 (95% CI: 1.36, 1.82) for myocardial infarction, 1.41 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.55) for stroke, 1.75 (95% CI: 1.49, 2.06) for peripheral vascular disease, 1.98 (95% CI: 1.50, 2.62) for aortic aneurysm and 2.03 (95% CI: 1.77, 2.33) for venous thromboembolism. Patients with GCA also had increased risks for other incident comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, depression, etc.), but not for cancer. Patients with GCA had more prior vascular diseases and other comorbidities before the diagnosis and they also had increased risks for incident vascular diseases and many other incident comorbidities after the diagnosis compared with non-vasculitis population.",

Research data related to test substances are critical for developing novel alternative tests. Moreover, safety information on cosmetic materials has neither been collected in a database nor shared among researchers. Therefore, it is imperative to build and share a database of safety information on toxicological mechanisms and pathways collected through in vivo, in vitro, and in silico methods. We developed the CAMSEC database (named after the research team; the Consortium of Alternative Methods for Safety Evaluation of Cosmetics) to fulfill this purpose. On the same website, our aim is to provide updates on current alternative research methods in Korea. The database will not be used directly to conduct safety evaluations, but researchers or regulatory individuals can use it to facilitate their work in formulating safety evaluations for cosmetic materials. We hope this database will help establish new alternative research methods to conduct efficient safety evaluations of cosmetic materials.",
  "27446550": "Heat-shock protein 60 of Porphyromonas gingivalis may induce dysfunction of human umbilical endothelial cells via regulation of endothelial-nitric oxide synthase and vascular endothelial-cadherin Accumulating evidence has established that periodontitis was an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CAD). Porphyromonus gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a major periodontal pathogen, has already been shown to have a significant role in the inflammatory response of CAD in vivo. The aim of the present study was to identify whether P. gingivalis heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60) induced the dysfunction of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. HUVECs were stimulated with a range of P. gingivalis HSP60 concentrations (1, 10 and 100 ng/l) at different time-points. The levels of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-3 (caspase-3) were measured using western blot analysis. The apoptotic rate of HUVECs was detected using flow cytometry. P. gingivalis HSP60 at a concentration of 10 ng/l significantly decreased the expression levels of VE-cadherin and eNOS protein at 24 h stimulation, whereas no difference in these proteins was identified following a low dose of P. gingivalis HSP60 (1 ng/l). P. gingivalis HSP60 at 100 ng/l significantly downregulated the expression levels of VE-cadherin and eNOS protein at 12 h in HUVECs. However, the cleavage of caspase-3 showed an opposing change at different concentrations. Consistently, P. gingivalis HSP60 induced apoptosis of HUVECs in a concentration - dependent manner. These results indicated that P. gingivalis HSP60 may induce dysfunction and apoptosis in HUVECs via downregulating the expression levels of VE-cadherin and eNOS, and promoting the cleavage of caspase-3.",
  "27293123": "Everyday (in)equality at home: complex constructions of gender in South African families High rates of violence and HIV have been documented within the South African context. Constructions of masculinity and femininity that position men as dominant and highly sexually active and women as subordinate and acquiescent have been found to contribute towards gender inequality. This inequality is in turn related to negative health consequences, specifically violence against women, children, and other men, as well as sexual risk. Within this context it becomes important to explore how problematic constructions of gender are being (re) produced and how these constructions are being challenged. Families have been identified as key sites in which gender is both constructed and enacted on a daily basis and it is within this space that children are first exposed to notions of gender. This article draws from a study that was intended to expand on the limited understandings of the ways in which gender (in)equality is constructed and conveyed within the context of South African families on an everyday basis. Children and parents in 18 families from a range of different material and cultural backgrounds were interviewed about the meanings and practices of gender within their homes. Data were analysed using a Foucauldian discourse analysis. The data reveal how problematic constructions of masculinity and femininity are (re) produced but also challenged within a range of different families. Gender and gender (in)equality are therefore routinely accomplished in complex ways. These findings have important implications for promoting gender equality and therefore for disrupting violence and sexual risk as gendered health issues.",

Computed tomography scans of patients with undescended testes were retrospectively collected (2011-2016). Imaging features of nontorsed undescended testis were compared with a case of an inguinal torsed testis. Observations included location of the undescended testis, size (length × width) and texture of each testis, peritesticular findings, position of testicular vessels, and enhancement patterns. Twelve nontorsed inguinal undescended testes were compared with 1 torsed undescended testicle. Torsed testis was larger than nontorsed (44 × 27 mm vs 32.9 ± 6.1 × 22.9 ± 4.9 mm), surrounded by fat stranding and fluid, with heterogeneous texture, enhancement of its outer layers, and an upward kink of its vessels. Because torsed undescended testis can mimic a groin abscess and because torsion is a medical emergency, radiologists should be aware of this entity and its distinguishing imaging features.

Both environmental and genetic factors both play critical roles in the process of heroin addiction. We aimed to investigate the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LIN7C, BDNFOS and BDNF genes and drug addiction in the Han Chinese population. We conducted a case-control study among 692 cases and 700 healthy controls from Xi'an, China. Eight SNPs were selected and genotyped using MassARRAY technology (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. Using the chi-squared test, we found that rs7481311 (OR =1.275, 95% CI = 1.087-1.497, p = 0.009) and rs11030096 (OR =1.227, 95% CI = 1.049-1.436, p = 0.011) in the BNDFOS were associated with an increased risk of heroin addiction. By contrast, rs988712 located in BDNFOS showed a decreased risk of heroin addiction (OR =0.734, 95% CI = 0.582-0.925, p = 0.003). By genetic model analysis, we found that the 'T' allele of rs988712 in BDNFOS had a protective role for heroin addiction in the additive model and dominant model (p < 0.05). By contrast, the allele 'T' of rs7481311 in BDNFOS significantly elevated the risk of heroin addiction in the additive model, recessive model and dominant model (p < 0.05). We also found that allele 'C ' of rs11030096 was associated with an increased risk of addiction in the dominant model and additive model (p < 0.05). Additionally, we found that rs6265, rs11030104 and rs10767664 in BDNF were associated with a decreased risk of heroin addiction (p < 0.05). However, only rs7481311 in BDNFOS remained significant after Bonferroni correction (p < 0.00625). These results suggest that polymorphisms of BDNFOS play an important role in heroin addiction susceptibility in the Chinese Han population.",

  "27601937": "Molecular mechanism leading to SAHA - induced autophagy in tumor cells: evidence for a p53 -dependent pathway Recent studies indicated that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), a class of anticancer agents, are in addition to their ability of apoptosis induction also capable of provoking autophagy. Promoted by the treatment of malignant uterine sarcoma cells with the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), we previously demonstrated predominant dose-dependent activation of autophagy in ESS-1 cells, but prevalent induction of apoptosis in MES-SA cells. In order to extend our previous studies, SAHA - treated ESS-1 and MES-SA cells were monitored for protein expression to reveal differences in known markers of apoptosis explaining the different cytotoxic responses. Further analysis of the identified candidate protein included cell rescue experiments by gene transfer followed by subsequent screening of cells for induction of apoptosis and autophagy by immunoblotting, caspase activity as well as LC3 and MDC / PI staining. LDH release assays were performed to assess the amount of cell -mediated cytotoxicity. In our search for responsible autophagic regulatory genes upstream of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we now discovered that, in contrast to MES-SA cells, a TP53-637C>T nonsense mutation located in the transactivating domain of the oncogenic suppressor p53 causes loss of its protein and consequently reduced PUMA induction in ESS-1 cells. Upon re-introduction of wild-type TP53, SAHA - treated ESS-1 cells underwent immediate apoptotic cell death as supported by upregulation of PUMA and caspase-9 as well as by activation of caspases-3 and - 7 and PARP-1 cleavage. Concurrent downregulation of autophagy was noticed by upregulated mTor and phospho-mTOR expression as well as monitoring autophagosome formation employing LC3 and MDC staining. Previously, cytoplasmic master regulatory activities of the oncogenic suppressor p53 in inhibiting autophagy and triggering apoptosis were unravelled. Accordingly, p53 - deficiency could explain both, the previously documented apoptosis resistance and prevailing SAHA - induced autophagy in ESS-1 cells. Using MES-SA cells with RNAi-silenced p53 expression and several p53 - deficient tumor cell lines undergoing SAHA - induced autophagy, we could generally validate our finding suggesting an inhibitory role for p53 in the autophagic pathway in response to SAHA treatment. Conclusively, these results could identify cytoplasmic p53 protein as a molecular switch that directly mediates the cytotoxic response of SAHA and thus open new therapeutic avenues.",
  "28492483": "PCVMZM: Using the Probabilistic Classification Vector Machines Model Combined with a Zernike Moments Descriptor to Predict Protein-Protein Interactions from Protein Sequences Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for most living organisms ' process. Thus, detecting PPIs is extremely important to understand the molecular mechanisms of biological systems. Although many PPIs data have been generated by high-throughput technologies for a variety of organisms, the whole interatom is still far from complete. In addition, the high-throughput technologies for detecting PPIs has some unavoidable defects, including time consumption, high cost, and high error rate. In recent years, with the development of machine learning, computational methods have been broadly used to predict PPIs, and can achieve good prediction rate. In this paper, we present here PCVMZM, a computational method based on a Probabilistic Classification Vector Machines (PCVM) model and Zernike moments (ZM) descriptor for predicting the PPIs from protein amino acids sequences. Specifically, a Zernike moments (ZM) descriptor is used to extract protein evolutionary information from Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) generated by Position-Specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST). Then, PCVM classifier is used to infer the interactions among protein. When performed on PPIs datasets of Yeast and H. Pylori, the proposed method can achieve the average prediction accuracy of 94.48% and 91.25%, respectively. In order to further evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the state-of-the-art support vector machines (SVM) classifier is used and compares with the PCVM model. Experimental results on the Yeast dataset show that the performance of PCVM classifier is better than that of SVM classifier. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method is robust, powerful and feasible, which can be used as a helpful tool for proteomics research.",
  "27514242": "Botulinum Toxin Use in Refractory Pain and Other Symptoms in Parkinsonism Parkinson's disease (PD) and other parkinsonian syndromes are chronic, progressive neurodegenerative diseases. With advancing disease, both motor and non-motor symptoms represent a considerable burden and symptom relief and quality of life improvement become the main goal of treatment. Botulinum toxins (BTX) are an effective treatment modality for many neurological conditions. To understand the potential usefulness of BTX in this population, we performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD and atypical parkinsonism who received treatment with BTX injections in our center from 1995 to 2014 for a variety of symptoms. Response to BTX was assessed using a subjective Clinical Global Impression. Records of 160 patients were reviewed. Probable idiopathic PD was the diagnosis in 117 patients (73.1%). The main indication for BTX treatment was pain (50.6% of cases). Other indications were the treatment of functional impairment resulting from dystonia (26.25%), sialorrhea (18.75%), freezing of gait, and camptocormia. Considering pain as indication, 81% of all patients with PD reported benefits after the first BTX injections. This benefit was maintained after the last recorded visit without significant difference in outcome compared with the first injection (p=0.067). Similar results were observed in patients with atypical parkinsonism. Our results confirm the safety and efficacy of different uses of BTX in the symptomatic treatment of patients with parkinsonism even in advanced stages of the disease, and suggest BTX treatment could have a safe and useful role in the treatment of pain in this population.",
  "27254091": "Using Evolutionary Theory to Guide Mental Health Research Evolutionary approaches to medicine can shed light on the origins and etiology of disease. Such an approach may be especially useful in psychiatry, which frequently addresses conditions with heterogeneous presentation and unknown causes. We review several previous applications of evolutionary theory that highlight the ways in which psychiatric conditions may persist despite and because of natural selection. One lesson from the evolutionary approach is that some conditions currently classified as disorders (because they cause distress and impairment) may actually be caused by functioning adaptations operating \" normally \" (as designed by natural selection). Such conditions suggest an alternative illness model that may generate alternative intervention strategies. Thus, the evolutionary approach suggests that psychiatry should sometimes think differently about distress and impairment. The complexity of the human brain, including normal functioning and potential for dysfunctions, has developed over evolutionary time and has been shaped by natural selection. Understanding the evolutionary origins of psychiatric conditions is therefore a crucial component to a complete understanding of etiology.",

There is paucity of specialized health services for the elderly in Africa. Nigeria, with a population of over 170 million, did not have any healthcare facility with dedicated services for the elderly until 2012. The University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) in Nigeria was established in 1973 and created its geriatrics unit in October 2013. A prepared environment and trained interdisciplinary teams are pivotal in providing effective healthcare services for the elderly. The ongoing UBTH geriatrics project aims to provide specialized interdisciplinary health services to older adults and to provide training and continuing professional development in geriatrics for healthcare staff. In developing our inpatient services, we adopted the acute care for elders (ACE) model and worked in tandem with the \"ABCs\" of implementing ACE units. In the face of limited resources, it was possible to establish a functional geriatrics unit with a trained interdisciplinary team. Family participation is central in our practice. Since October 2013, residents and house officers in internal medicine have been undertaking 4- and 12- weekly rotations, respectively. There is also a robust academic program, which includes once- weekly geriatric pharmacotherapy seminars, once- weekly interdisciplinary seminars, and 2- weekly journal club meetings alternating with seminars on geriatric assessment tools. It is possible to establish geriatric services and achieve best practices in resource-limited settings by investing on improving available human resources and infrastructure. We also make recommendations for setting up similar services in other parts of Africa.",

We reviewed medical records from 160 deceased palliative cancer patients that had been included in previous studies on vitamin D and infections. Patients treated with antibiotics during the last two weeks of life were identified and net effects of treatment (symptom relief) and possible adverse events were extracted from medical records. Seventy-nine patients (49%) had been treated with antibiotics during the last two weeks in life. In 37% (n = 29), the treatment resulted in evident symptom relief and among these 50% had a positive bacterial culture, 43% had a negative culture and in 7% no culture was taken. Among the patients with no or unknown effect of antibiotics, 50% had a positive culture. When the indication for antibiotic treatment was to avoid or treat sepsis, symptom relief was achieved in 50% of the patients (n = 19). Only 4% (n = 3) of the patients experienced adverse events of the treatment (diarrhea, nausea). Treating infections with antibiotics in the last weeks of life may improve the quality of life for palliative cancer patients, especially if sepsis is suspected or confirmed.

The aims of this study were to establish Colombian smoothed centile charts and LMS L (Box-Cox transformation), M (median), and S (coefficient of variation) tables for triceps, subscapular, and triceps + subscapular skinfolds; appropriate cut-offs were selected using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis based on a population-based sample of children and adolescents in Bogotá, Colombia. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 9618 children and adolescents (55.7% girls; age range of 9-17.9 years). Triceps and subscapular skinfold measurements were obtained using standardized methods. We calculated the triceps + subscapular skinfold (T + SS) sum. Smoothed percentile curves for triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness were derived using the LMS method. ROC curve analyses were used to evaluate the optimal cut-off point of skinfold thickness for overweight and obesity, based on the International Obesity Task Force definitions. Subscapular and triceps skinfolds and T + SS were significantly higher in girls than in boys (p < 0.001). The ROC analysis showed that subscapular and triceps skinfolds and T + SS have a high discriminatory power in the identification of overweight and obesity in the sample population in this study.

From the PET Prognosis Multicenter Registry, a cohort of 3413 patients underwent vasodilator stress Rb-82 PET MPI with dipyridamole or adenosine. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression to analyze the association with mortality of four BP variables: stress minus rest systolic BP (∆SBP), stress minus rest diastolic BP (∆DBP), resting systolic BP (rSBP), and resting diastolic BP (rDBP). Covariates that had univariate P values <.10 were entered into the multivariable model. After median 1.7 years follow-up, 270 patients died. In univariate analyses, ∆SBP (P = .082), rSBP (P = .008), and rDBP (P < .001) were of potential prognostic value (P < .10), but ∆DBP was not (P = .96). After adjustment for other clinical and MPI variables, ∆SBP no longer independently predicted mortality (P = .082); only lower rSBP (P = .026) and lower rDBP (P = .045) remained independently prognostic. In patients undergoing vasodilator stress MPI, only lower resting BP is an independent predictor of mortality along with other clinical and MPI variables; BP response does not appear to add to risk stratification in these patients.",

Prevalence, co-occurrence and clustering of 6 common health conditions: wheeze; eczema; long-standing illness (excluding wheeze and eczema); injury; socioemotional difficulties (measured using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) and unfavourable weight (thin / overweight / obese vs normal). 42.4% of children had 2 or more adverse health conditions (co-occurrence). Co-occurrence was more common in boys and children from lower income households. Latent class analysis identified 6 classes: ' normative ' (57.4%): ' atopic burdened ' (14.0%); ' socioemotional burdened ' (11.0%); ' unfavourable weight / injury ' (7.7%); ' eczema / injury ' (6.0%) and ' eczema / unfavourable weight ' (3.9%). As with co-occurrence, class membership differed by sociodemographic factors: boys, children of mothers with lower educational attainment and children from lower income households were more likely to be in the ' socioemotional burdened ' class. Children of mothers with higher educational attainment were more likely to be in the ' normative ' and ' eczema / unfavourable weight ' classes. Co-occurrence of adverse health conditions at age 11 is common and is associated with adverse socioeconomic circumstances.

  "27626498": "DRG1 is a potential oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma and promotes tumor progression via spindle checkpoint signaling regulation Developmentally regulated GTP binding protein 1 (DRG1), a member of the DRG family, plays important roles in regulating cell growth. However, the molecular basis of DRG1 in cell proliferation regulation and the relationship between DRG1 and tumor progression remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that DRG1 is elevated in lung adenocarcinomas while weakly expressed in adjacent lung tissues. DRG1 knockdown causes growth inhibition of tumor cells by significantly increasing the proportion of cells in M phase. Overexpression of DRG1 leads to chromosome missegregation which is an important index for tumorigenesis. Interestingly, ectopic of DRG1 reduces taxol induced apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mechanistic analyses confirm that DRG1 localizes at mitotic spindles in dividing cells and binds to spindle checkpoint signaling proteins in vivo. These studies highlight the expanding role of DRG1 in tumorigenesis and reveal a mechanism of DRG1 in taxol resistance.",

The aim of the present study is to examine if the accumulation of Cd in the human lymphocyte B cell line BJAB and its capacity to promote oxidative stress and adverse effects could result from changes in the mRNA expression pattern of Zn transporters and metallothioneins. Cells were exposed to 5, 10, 20 and 40μM of CdCl2 equivalent to 0.91, 1.83, 3.66 and 7.33μg/ml respectively, for 24h. Cd significantly reduced the viability of BJAB cells and induced a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage. Cd also induced the formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine adducts and augmented MTF1 expression in BJAB cells. We observed interesting responses in relative gene expression to Cd exposure among the seven transporters we analyzed. Cd exposure increased the expression of DMT1 and caused an up-regulation of ZnT1. However, the T calcium channel alpha1G subunit could not be detected. A change in expression of ZnTs and Zips in response to Cd exposure emphasizes the involvement of Zn transporters in Cd cellular metabolism and induced oxidative stress.",
  "27771746": "Identification and functional analysis of the GTPV bidirectional promoter region The goat pox chick embryo-attenuated virus (GTPV) has been developed as an effective vaccine that can elicit protective immune responses. It possesses a large genome and a robust ability to express exogenous genes. Thus, this virus is an ideal vector for recombinant live vaccines for infectious diseases in ruminant animals. In this study, we identified a novel bidirectional promoter region of GTPV through screening named PbVV(±). PbVV(±) is located between ETF-l and VITF-3, which are transcribed in opposite directions. A new recombinant goat pox virus (rGTPV) was constructed, in which duplicate PbVV(+) was used as a promoter element to enhance Brucella OMP31 expression, and duplicate PbVV (-) was used as a promoter element to regulate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the same time as the selection marker. PbVV(-) promoter activity was compared to that of the P7.5 promoter of vaccinia virus, as measured by EGFP expression; the fluorescence intensity of EGFP expressed in cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. PbVV(+) promoter activity was measured by Brucella OMP31 expression. Interaction with the anti-Brucella-OMP31 monoclonal antibody was confirmed by western blotting, and OMP31 mRNA expression was assessed by qRT-PCR. The results of this study will be useful for the further study of effective multivalent vaccines based on rGTPV. This study also provides a theoretical basis for overcoming the problem of low expression of exogenous genes.",
  "27234031": "Improved diagnostic yield of neuromuscular disorders applying clinical exome sequencing in patients arising from a consanguineous population Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) include a broad range of disorders affecting muscles, nerves and neuromuscular junctions. Their overlapping phenotypes and heterogeneous genetic nature have created challenges in diagnosis which calls for the implementation of massive parallel sequencing as a candidate strategy to increase the diagnostic yield. In this study, total of 45 patients, mostly offspring of consanguineous marriages were examined using whole exome sequencing. Data analysis was performed to identify the most probable pathogenic rare variants in known NMD genes which led to identification of causal variants for 33 out of 45 patients (73.3%) in the following known genes: CAPN3, Col6A1, Col6A3, DMD, DYSF, FHL1, GJB1, ISPD, LAMA2, LMNA, PLEC1, RYR1, SGCA, SGCB, SYNE1, TNNT1 and 22 novel pathogenic variants were detected. Today, the advantage of whole exome sequencing in clinical diagnostic strategies of heterogeneous disorders is clear. In this cohort, a diagnostic yield of 73.3% was achieved which is quite high compared to the overall reported diagnostic yield of 25% to 50%. This could be explained by the consanguineous background of these patients and is another strong advantage of offering clinical exome sequencing in diagnostic laboratories, especially in populations with high rate of consanguinity.",
  "28224642": "Methodological considerations for designing a community water fluoridation cessation study High-quality, up-to-date research on community water fluoridation (CWF), and especially on the implications of CWF cessation for dental health, is limited. Although CWF cessation studies have been conducted, they are few in number; one of the major reasons is the methodological complexity of conducting such a study. This article draws on a systematic review of existing cessation studies (n=15) to explore methodological considerations of conducting CWF cessation studies in future. We review nine important methodological aspects (study design, comparison community, target population, time frame, sampling strategy, clinical indicators, assessment criteria, covariates and biomarkers) and provide recommendations for planning future CWF cessation studies that examine effects on dental caries. There is no one ideal study design to answer a research question. However, recommendations proposed regarding methodological aspects to conduct an epidemiological study to observe the effects of CWF cessation on dental caries, coupled with our identification of important methodological gaps, will be useful for researchers who are looking to optimize resources to conduct such a study with standards of rigour.",
  "28049415": "Improving protein complex prediction by reconstructing a high-confidence protein-protein interaction network of Escherichia coli from different physical interaction data sources Although different protein-protein physical interaction (PPI) datasets exist for Escherichia coli, no common methodology exists to integrate these datasets and extract reliable modules reflecting the existing biological process and protein complexes. Naïve Bayesian formula is the highly accepted method to integrate different PPI datasets into a single weighted PPI network, but detecting proper weights in such network is still a major problem. In this paper, we proposed a new methodology to integrate various physical PPI datasets into a single weighted PPI network in a way that the detected modules in PPI network exhibit the highest similarity to available functional modules. We used the co-expression modules as functional modules, and we shown that direct functional modules detected from Gene Ontology terms could be used as an alternative dataset. After running this integrating methodology over six different physical PPI datasets, orthologous high-confidence interactions from a related organism and two AP-MS PPI datasets gained high weights in the integrated networks, while the weights for one AP-MS PPI dataset and two other datasets derived from public databases have converged to zero. The majority of detected modules shaped around one or few hub protein(s). Still, a large number of highly interacting protein modules were detected which are functionally relevant and are likely to construct protein complexes. We provided a new high confidence protein complex prediction method supported by functional studies and literature mining.",

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the influence of hysterectomy on pelvic floor disorders. This was a prospective and longitudinal study. The study was conducted at the Ankara University Department of Surgery and the Dr Zekai Tahir Burak Women's Health Research and Education Hospital between September 2008 and March 2011. The study was performed on patients who underwent hysterectomy for benign pathologies. A questionnaire about urinary incontinence (International Continence Society scoring), anal incontinence, constipation, and obstructed defecation (Rome criteria and constipation severity score), along with an extensive obstetric history, was administered preoperatively and postoperatively annually for 4 years. Patients (N = 327) who had completed each of the 4 annual postoperative follow-ups were included in this study. Compared with the preoperative observations, the occurrence of each symptom was significantly increased at each of the follow-up years (p < 0.001). Over the 4 postoperative years, the frequencies for constipation (n = 245) were 7.8%, 8.2%, 8.6%, and 5.3%; those for obstructed defecation (n = 269) were 4.5%, 5.2%, 4.1%, and 3.0%; those for anal incontinence (n = 252) were 4.8%, 6.3%, 6.0%, and 5.2%, and those for urinary incontinence (n = 99) were 12.1%, 12.1%, 11.1%, and 13.1%. In addition, patients who had no preoperative symptom (n = 70) from any of the selected symptoms showed a postoperative occurrence of at least 1 of these symptoms of 15.8%, 14.3%, 11.4%, and 8.6% for the postoperative years 1, 2, 3, and 4. Although the study had several limitations, no comparison with a control population was the most important one. Hysterectomy for benign gynecologic pathologies had a significant negative impact on pelvic floor functions in patients who had no previous symptoms.",

In experiment 1, SVC were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS (Control) and treated with 300 µM oleic acid (OLA) + FBS, linoleic acid (LNA) + FBS, palmitic acid (PAM) + FBS, or stearic acid (STA) + FBS for 48 h. In experiment 2, cells were grown in DMEM containing 5% CS and treated with 300 µM OLA (CS + OLA), PAM (CS + PAM), STA (CS + STA) or 200 µM LNA (CS + LNA) for 48 h. Adipogenesis was determined using Oil Red O staining and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity. The proportion of OLA, PAM, or STA was increased (P < 0.05) in SVC grown in either FBS or CS with OLA, PAM or STA. Adipogenesis was induced in FBS + OLA, FBS + LNA, FBS + PAM, FBS + STA, CS + OLA, CS + LNA, CS + PAM, or CS + STA compared to FBS. GPDH activity was significantly higher in FBS + OLA and FBS + LNA than one in FBS. Compared to FBS, the expression of FABP4 mRNA increased (P < 0.05) in FBS + OLA, FBS + LNA, or FBS + PAM, whereas that of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and ATGL increased (P < 0.05) in FBS + OLA or FBS + LNA cells. Expression of FABP4 and C/EBPβ mRNA was higher in CS, CS + OLA, CS + LNA, CS + PAM, or CS + STA compared with (FBS, whereas the expression of ATGL and C/EBPα was higher in CS, CS + OLA, or CS + LNA than FBS cells. In conclusion, these results showed that FA have different potentials to induce adipogenesis, LNA is the most potent among the tested FA, and these potentials can be improved in the presence of CS.",
  "27526315": "Expression and methylation in posttraumatic stress disorder and resilience; evidence of a role for odorant receptors Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and potentially disabling disorder that develops in 1/5 to 1/3 of people exposed to severe trauma. Twin studies indicate that genetic factors account for at least one third of the variance in the risk for developing PTSD, however, the specific role for genetic factors in the pathogenesis of PTSD is not well understood. We studied genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles in 12 participants with PTSD and 12 participants who were resilient to similar severity trauma exposure. Close to 4000 genes were differentially expressed with adjusted p<0.05, fold-change >2, with all but 3 upregulated with PTSD. Eight odorant/olfactory receptor related genes were up-regulated with PTSD as well as genes related to immune activation, the Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid A (GABAA) receptor, and vitamin D synthesis. No differences with adjusted significance for DNA methylation were found. We conclude that increased gene expression may play an important role in PTSD and this expression may not be a consequence of DNA methylation. The role of odorant receptor expression warrants independent replication.",

A total of 1062 patients underwent renal CT angiography with 270 or 320 mg I/mL of iodixanol with dual-energy spectral CT imaging in late arterial phase. Image quality and their influence on renal function were compared. There were no significant differences of CT value, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective score of renal vessels between 2 groups (all P > 0.05). The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with abnormal renal function using 320 mg I/mL of iodixanol was significantly higher than using 270 mg I/mL of iodixanol (P = 0.043).

  "28232582": "PUMILIO / FOXP1 signaling drives expansion of hematopoietic stem/progenitor and leukemia cells RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have emerged as important regulators of invertebrate adult stem cells, but their activities remain poorly appreciated in mammals. Using a short hairpin RNA strategy, we demonstrate here that the 2 mammalian RBPs, PUMILIO (PUM)1 and PUM2, members of the PUF family of posttranscriptional regulators, are essential for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation and survival in vitro and in vivo upon reconstitution assays. Moreover, we found that PUM1 / 2 sustain myeloid leukemic cell growth. Through a proteomic approach, we identified the FOXP1 transcription factor as a new target of PUM1 / 2. Contrary to its canonical repressive activity, PUM1 / 2 rather promote FOXP1 expression by a direct binding to 2 canonical PUM responsive elements present in the FOXP1 - 3' untranslated region (UTR). Expression of FOXP1 strongly correlates with PUM1 and PUM2 levels in primary HSPCs and myeloid leukemia cells. We demonstrate that FOXP1 by itself supports HSPC and leukemic cell growth, thus mimicking PUM activities. Mechanistically, FOXP1 represses the expression of the p21(-CIP1) and p27(-KIP1) cell cycle inhibitors. Enforced FOXP1 expression reverses shPUM antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities. Altogether, our results reveal a novel regulatory pathway, underscoring a previously unknown and interconnected key role of PUM1 / 2 and FOXP1 in regulating normal HSPC and leukemic cell growth.",

Forty children with HLH and 160 age - and gender -matched healthy controls from Xuzhou Children's Hospital were enrolled in the study. Serum IFN-γ and IL-10 levels were measured by enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay. Polymorphisms of the IFN-γ gene at position +874 and +2109, and IL-10 at position -1082 were analyzed by allele - specific PCR. Median serum concentrations of IFN -γ and IL-10 were significantly higher in children with HLH compared to healthy controls. The frequencies of IFN-γ +874 T/A and T/T genotypes, as well as T allele, were significantly higher in the HLH group compared with those in the control group. The frequencies of IL-10 -1082 G/A genotype and G allele were significantly increased in HLH patients compared with healthy controls. No significant difference was found in the distribution of IFN-γ +2109 G/A genotypes between children with HLH and controls.

  "27494907": "Cluster - dependent colistin hetero-resistance in Enterobacter cloacae complex Aims of this study were to: (i) evaluate whether the cluster membership could have an impact on hetero-resistance phenotype to colistin in the Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC); and (ii) determine the genetic mechanism of colistin hetero-resistance in ECC. A collection of 124 clinical isolates belonging to 13 clusters were used to analyse the hetero-resistance phenotype (MICs were determined using the broth microdilution method, Etest and population analysis profiling). Different mutants (ΔphoP, ΔphoQ, ΔphoPQ, ΔpmrA, ΔpmrB, ΔpmrAB, ΔarnE, ΔarnF and ΔarnBCADTEF) were constructed and tested for their colistin hetero-resistance phenotype. Based on broth microdilution and Etest results, it was shown that the hetero-resistance to colistin depended on the cluster: strains from clusters I, II, IV, VII, IX, X, XI and XII were usually hetero-resistant, whereas those from clusters III, V, VI, VIII and XIII were categorized as susceptible. However, for some cluster V and VIII strains, a small proportion (<10(-7)) of cells appeared resistant when tested by population analysis profiling. From a mechanistic point of view, analysis of mutants revealed that the mechanism of hetero-resistance was mainly due to the expression of the arn operon and the phoP / phoQ two-component regulatory system. Because the colistin hetero-resistance appeared cluster - dependent in the ECC, it should be advocated to determine the cluster of the strain associated with the infection in parallel with the MIC of colistin. The resistance mechanism may not be similar to other Enterobacteriaceae since only the two-component regulatory system PhoP / PhoQ (and not PmrA / PmrB) seemed to play a role in resistance regulation.",

Various rice sample preparation procedures were evaluated. The analytical method was validated by measuring several parameters including limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, relative bias, and repeatability. Regarding the sample preparation, recoveries of spiked samples were within the acceptable range from 89.3 to 98.2% for muffle furnace, 94.2 to 103.3% for heating block, 81.0 to 115.0% for hot plate, and 92.8 to 108.2% for microwave. Validation parameters showed that the method fits for its purpose, being the total arsenic, cadmium, and lead within the Brazilian Legislation limits. The method was applied for analyzing 37 rice samples (including polished, brown, and parboiled), consumed by the Brazilian population. The total arsenic, cadmium, and lead contents were lower than the established legislative values, except for total arsenic in one brown rice sample.

Here we introduce a biocompatible and degradable mesostructured form of silicon with multi-scale structural and chemical heterogeneities. The material was synthesized using mesoporous silica as a template through a chemical vapour deposition process. It has an amorphous atomic structure, an ordered nanowire -based framework and random submicrometre voids, and shows an average Young's modulus that is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of single-crystalline silicon. In addition, we used the heterogeneous silicon mesostructures to design a lipid-bilayer -supported bioelectric interface that is remotely controlled and temporally transient, and that permits non - genetic and subcellular optical modulation of the electrophysiology dynamics in single dorsal root ganglia neurons. Our findings suggest that the biomimetic expansion of silicon into heterogeneous and deformable forms can open up opportunities in extracellular biomaterial or bioelectric systems.",

In a longitudinal observational study (372 residents) with up to 3.5 years of follow-up, we examined relationships between dementia severity, the development of pneumonia, intake problems, and mortality using joint modeling, Cox models, and mediation analyses. Dementia severity was measured semiannually with the Bedford Alzheimer Nursing Severity-Scale (BANS-S). The median BANS-S score at baseline was 13 (range, 7 to 28). Pneumonia occurred in 103 (28%) and intake problems in 126 (34%) of 367 residents with complete registration of pneumonia and intake problems. Compared with dementia severity, incident pneumonia and, even more so, incident intake problems were more strongly associated with mortality risk. Pneumonia and intake problems both mediated the relationship between more severe dementia and mortality. Developing pneumonia and intake problems affects survival, and this is not limited to advanced dementia. The occurrence of pneumonia and intake problems are important signals to consider a palliative care approach in nursing home residents with dementia, and an active focus on advance care planning is needed.

Recently, dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has emerged as a new candidate that may be linked to metabolic diseases. We hypothesize that selective modulation of the intestinal microbiota by probiotic or synbiotic supplementation may improve metabolic dysfunction and prevent diabetes in prediabetics. In this study, a synthesis and study of synbiotics will be carried out for the first time in Iran. In a randomized triple-blind controlled clinical trial, 120 adults with impaired glucose tolerance based on the inclusion criteria will be selected by a simple random sampling method and will be randomly allocated to 6 months of 6 g/d probiotic, synbiotic or placebo. The fecal abundance of bacteria, blood pressure, height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences will be measured at baseline and following treatment.

  "27550416": "Modulation of IL-6 induced RANKL expression in arthritic synovium by a transcription factor SOX5 Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) is critically involved in bone erosion of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We previously reported association between younger age at onset of RA and a RANKL promoter SNP that conferred an elevated promoter activity via binding to a transcription factor SOX5. Here we study the regulation of SOX5 levels in relation to RANKL expression in RA synovial fibroblasts (SF) and the development of bone erosion in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse. Our data indicated SOX5 levels were higher in synovium and synovial fluid from RA compared to osteoarthritis patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulated SOX5 and RANKL expression in both primary RA SF and the rheumatoid synovial fibroblast cell line, MH7A. Overexpression of SOX5 resulted in significantly increased RANKL levels, while knockdown of SOX5 resulted in diminished IL-6 mediated RANKL upregulation in MH7A cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed approximately 3-fold enrichment of RANKL-specific DNA in anti-SOX5 immunoprecipitate in IL-6 treated MH7A cells as compared to untreated cells. Locally silencing SOX5 gene significantly diminished RANKL positive cells and bone erosion in CIA mice. These findings suggest SOX5 is an important regulator of IL-6 - induced RANKL expression in RA SF.",

In this pilot study, the performance of an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) system in imaging periodontal structures in humans was evaluated. Gingival sulcus depth measurements were obtained and compared with traditional probes. In total, 445 sites of 23 periodontally healthy individuals were measured by 3 instruments: North Carolina manual probe, Florida automated probe and OCT at 1325 nm. To obtain quantitative measurements from OCT images, the gingival refractive index was also determined. Discomfort / pain perception and the duration of examinations were compared among the instruments. The analysis of OCT images allowed the identification of relevant anatomic dental and periodontal regions. The average sulcus depth measured by OCT, 0.85 ± 0.27 mm and 0.87 ± 0.28 mm, was lower than the values obtained by manual and automated probing. Discomfort / pain were prevalent for traditional probes, which are invasive methods, than for the non-invasive OCT technique. OCT has the potential to be a reliable tool for in vivo periodontal tissues evaluation and for reproducible sulcus depth measurements in healthy sites.

However, misclassification of exposures has not been explored in population epidemiological studies on air pollution from biodegradable wastes. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of different approaches for assessing exposure to air pollution from biodegradable wastes by analyzing (1) the misclassification of exposure that is committed by using these surrogates, (2) the existence of differentia l misclassification (3) the effects that misclassification may have on health effect estimates and the interpretation of epidemiological results, and (4) the ability of the exposure measures to predict health outcomes using 10-fold cross validation. Four different exposure assessment approaches were studied: ammonia concentrations at the residence (Metric I), distance to the closest source (Metric II), number of sources within certain distances from the residence (Metric IIIa, b) and location in a specific region (Metric IV). Exposure-response models based on Metric I provided the highest predictive ability (72.3%) and goodness-of-fit, followed by IV, III and II. When compared to Metric I, Metric IV yielded the best results for exposure misclassification analysis and interpretation of health effect estimates, followed by Metric IIIb, IIIa and II. The study showed that modelled NH3 concentrations provide more accurate estimations of true exposure than distances-based surrogates, and that distance-based surrogates (especially those based on distance to the closest point source) are imprecise methods to identify exposed populations, although they may be useful for initial studies.",

Moreover, we investigated survival outcomes accounting for this parameter. We retrospectively evaluated data from 1,067 patients with BCa treated with RC between 1990 and 2013 at a single tertiary care referral center. All specimen were evaluated by dedicated uropathologists. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the effect of different histopathological variant on recurrence, cancer-specific mortality (CSM), and overall mortality (OM) after accounting for all available confounders. Of 1,067 patients, 729 (68.3%) harbored pure urothelial BCa while 338 (31.7%) were found to have a variant. Considering uncommon variants, 21 (2.0%) were sarcomatoid, 10 (0.9%) lymphoepitelial, 19 (1.8%) small cell, 109 (10.2%) squamous, 89 (8.3%) micropapillary, 23 (2.2%) glandular, 34 (3.2%) mixed variants, and 33 (3.1%) were found with other types of variants. With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 343 recurrence, 365 CSM, and 451 OM were recorded, respectively. At multivariable Cox regression analyses, the presence of small cell variant was associated with higher recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.47, P<0.001), CSM (HR = 3.30, P<0.04), and OM (HR = 2.97, P<0.003) as compared with pure urothelial cancer. Conversely, no survival differences were recorded considering other histological variants (all P> 0.1). Our study confirms that histological variant is not an infrequent event at RC specimen. However, in our single-center series, only patients found with small cell variant were associated with a negative effect on survival after RC.",

Groups 1 and 3 represented 60 % of the total obstetric population. The largest contributions to the total CSR are group 1 (37.62 %) and group 5 (17.06 %). Group 3 which was the second largest group contributed 15 % to the overall CSR. Group 2 and group 4 had high group CSRs of 47.28 and 34.74 % respectively, although the total group size was small (n = 1375;3.43 %). Maternal age and presentation were found to have an independent association with mode of delivery on logistic regression. The Ten-group classification helped to identify the main groups of subjects who contribute most to the overall CSR. It also helped to identify subgroups requiring closer monitoring for more in-depth analyses of the indications for caesarean section. It is important to focus on the first four TGCS groups which constitute about 75 % of all deliveries. It is in the low-risk groups that one is likely to find the highest and most inappropriate indications for cesarean sections.",
  "28150378": "Challenging some assumptions about empathy In New Zealand little nursing or medical curricula time, if any, is specifically devoted to the enhancement of empathy. If being empathic is important in the context of patient care, it is a quality that is already present in students or is learned by students during their practicum in the company of experienced clinicians. This study aimed to compare self-reported empathy ratings between different groups of medical students and one cohort of nursing students who were either exposed or not exposed to explicit empathy training or learning in clinical settings in the presence of patients. The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) was completed before and after groups of medical and nursing students had been exposed to various extended periods of practicum. Some medical student cohorts undertook brief empathy training, whereas others had no exposure. The nursing student cohort had no formal, explicit empathy training. Irrespective of profession, length of practicum or exposure to specific empathy training, there were no significant differences in the self-reported JSPE scores across the seven different cohorts of students. Empathy is a quality that is already present in students or is learned by students during their practicum DISCUSSION: If empathy is caught rather than taught, then brief efforts to enhance empathy may be futile. To optimise the inherent empathic qualities of aspirant health professionals, explicit consideration should be given to how empathy is influenced by the practicum experience.",

Our objectives were to describe the prevalence and pattern of skin injuries of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), to describe how this compared with previously demonstrated skin injury locations in typically developing children, and to identify differences in skin injury frequency and locations between autistic children with and without self-injurious behaviors (SIBs). Children with ASD were recruited between September of 2011 and September of 2014. Demographic information was obtained from the caregiver. All skin injuries and their locations were documented. Of the 41 children enrolled, half were reported to have SIBs. The most identified skin injury locations were the legs, knees, and back. Children with autism (1) obtain skin injuries frequently and in similar locations as typically developing children and (2) rarely obtain skin injuries to locations that are considered uncommon for accidental injuries despite reports of SIBs.",

Shandong province of China. A total of 2761 elderly households are included in the analysis. CHE incidence among elderly households was 44.9%. The CHE incidence of empty-nest singles (59.3%, p=0.000, OR=3.19) and empty-nest couples (52.9%, p=0.000, OR=2.45) are both statistically higher than that of non-empty-nest elderly households (31.4%). An inverse association was observed between CHE incidence and income level in all elderly household types. Factors including 1 or more household elderly members with non-communicable chronic diseases in the past 6 months, 1 or more elderly household members being hospitalised in the past year and lower household income, are significant risk factors for CHE in all 3 household types (p<0.05). Health insurance status was found to be a significant determinant of CHE among empty-nest singles and non-empty-nest households (p<0.05). CHE incidence among elderly households is high in China. Empty-nest households are at higher risk for CHE than non-empty-nest households. Based on these findings, we suggest that special insurance be developed to broaden the coverage of health services and heighten the reimbursement rate for empty-nest elderly in the existing health insurance schemes. Financial and social protection interventions are also essential for identifie d at-risk subgroups among different types of elderly households.",
  "27757318": "Adoptively transferred natural killer cells maintain long-term antitumor activity by epigenetic imprinting and CD4(+) T cell help Natural killer (NK) cell infusions can induce remissions in subsets of patients with different types of cancer. The optimal strategies for NK cell activation prior to infusion are still under debate. There is recent evidence that NK cells can acquire long-term functional competence by preactivation with the cytokines IL-12 / 15 / 18. The mechanisms supporting the maintenance of long-term NK cell antitumor activity are incompletely under-stood. Here, we show that NK cells preactivated in vitro with IL-12 / 15 / 18, but not with IL-15 alone, maintained high antitumor activity even 1 mo after transfer into lymphopenic RAG-2(-/-) γc(-/-) mice. The NK cell intrinsic ability for IFNγ production coincided with demethylation of the conserved non-coding sequence (CNS) 1 in the Ifng locus, previously shown to enhance transcription of Ifng. In a xenograft melanoma mouse model, human IL-12 / 15 / 18 -preactivated NK cells rejected tumors more efficiently. In RAG-2(-/-) γc(-/-) mice, co-transfer of CD4(+) T cells further improved the long-term competence of NK cells for IFNγ production that was dependent on IL-2. CD4(+) T cell activation during homeostatic proliferation required macrophages and further promoted the long-term NK cell antitumor activity. Thus, NK cells can \"remember\" a previous exposure to cytokines by epigenetic imprinting resulting in a remarkable stability of the IFNγ -producing phenotype after adoptive transfer. In addition, our results support combination of cytokine -preactivated NK cells with CD4(+) T cell activation upon lymphopenic conditioning to achieve long-term NK cell effector function for cancer immunotherapy.",
  "27306834": "Naïve CD8(+) T cell derived tumor - specific cytotoxic effectors as a potential remedy for overcoming TGF-β immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment Despite of the potential implications for cancer immunotherapy, conventional approaches using in vitro expanded CD8(+) T cells have suboptimal outcomes, mostly due to loss of functionality from cellular exhaustion. We therefore investigated the phenotypic and functional differences among in vitro activated CD8(+) T cells of three different sources, namely naïve (NTeff), memory (MTeff) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILeff) from human and mice, to better understand mechanisms behind potent effector functions and potential for overcoming current limitations. In line with the greater proliferation activity and longer telomere lengths of NTeff populations, cells of naïve origin exhibited significantly less amounts of T cell exhaustion markers than those of MTeff and TILeff, and moreover, acquired distinct expression patterns of memory-promoting transcription factors, T-bet and Eomes, induced in a rapid and sustainable manner. NTeff cells appeared to have lower expression of Foxp1 and were refractory to apoptosis upon TGF-β conditioning, implying better survival potential and resistance to tumor - induced immune suppression. Of CD8(+) T cell pools activated to tumor - specific CTLs, naïve cell generated effectors possessed the most potent cytotoxic activity, validating implications for use in rational design of adoptive immunotherapy.",

We evaluated the outcome of elderly patients who benefited from ICOAS for a strictly palliative goal METHODS: We performed a national retrospective cohort study in France of patients aged >75years old with PJI, and managed with ICOAS planned for life long from 2009 to 2014, and compared the population with an event versus the population free of event. Event was defined as a composite outcome in patients under ICOAS, including: local or systemic progression of the infection; death or discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy because of adverse drug reaction. Twenty-one patients were included, with a median age of 85 (IQR: 81; 88) years old. There were 8/21 patients with an event: 1 patient with adverse drug reaction; 3 patients had systemic progression of sepsis; and 2 had local progression. A total of 2/21 patients died. No deaths were related to ICOAS or infection. There was no significant difference (p >0.05) between the population with an event and free of event considering demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics. In our cohort, ICOAS seems to be an effective and safe option.",

This study aims to identify the expression of sonic Hh (SHH) protein of SHH pathway in oral epithelial dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) using SHH (H-160) (Santa Cruz, sc-9042) which could have therapeutic implication in future. A total of 250 cases comprising 50 normal oral mucosa, 50 cases of oral epithelial dysplasia, 50 well, 50 moderate and 50 poorly differentiated OSCCs were included in the study. Immunohistochemical evaluation of SHH protein expression was conducted using monoclonal antibody. Interpretation of the expression was done by immunoreactive score of Remmele and Stegner (IRS) scoring method. Chi-Square test was used to analyze the results. The study showed that SHH signaling molecules are highly expressed in OSCC, and their expression was mainly in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. The SHH signaling component is associated with the pathological parameter in OSCC and oral epithelial dysplasia.",
  "27898317": "Ammonia tolerant inocula provide a good base for anaerobic digestion of microalgae in third generation biogas process This study investigated the ability of an ammonia - acclimatized inoculum to digest efficiently protein -rich microalgae for continuous 3rd generation biogas production. Moreover, we investigated whether increased C / N ratio could alleviate ammonia toxicity. The biochemical methane potential (BMP) of five different algae (Chlorella vulgaris)/ manure (cattle) mixtures showed that the mixture of 80/20 (on VS basis) resulted in the highest BMP value (431mL CH4 gVS(-1)), while the BMP of microalgae alone (100/0) was 415mL CH4 gVS(-1). Subsequently, anaerobic digestion of those two substrates was tested in continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Despite of the high ammonium levels (3.7-4.2g NH4 (+)-NL(-1)), CSTR reactors using ammonia tolerant inoculum resulted in relatively high methane yields (i.e. 77.5% and 84% of the maximum expected, respectively). These results demonstrated that ammonia tolerant inocula could be a promising approach to successfully digest protein -rich microalgae and achieve a 3rd generation biogas production.",
  "28229178": "The consummatory and motivational behaviors for natural rewards following long-term withdrawal from morphine: no anhedonia but persistent maladaptive behaviors for high-value rewards The negative affective state, e.g., anhedonia, emerges after abstinence from abused drugs may be linked to the motivational processes of drug craving and relapse. Although anhedonia diminishes over time with drug abstinence, it is not yet rather explicit whether anhedonia exists or not following protracted withdrawal. The behavioral responses to natural rewards were examined after 2 to 3 weeks withdrawal from morphine. Male rats were pretreated with either a binge-like morphine paradigm or daily saline injection for 5 days. The consummatory and motivational behaviors for three natural rewards (sucrose solutions 4, 15, and 60%, social stimulus: male rat, and sexual stimulus: estrous female rat) were examined under varied testing conditions. The morphine - withdrawn rats significantly increased their intake of 15% sucrose solution during the 1-h consumption test and their operant responding for 15% sucrose solution under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. When obtaining a reinforcer was associated with a 0.5 mA foot shock under a PR-punishment schedule, the morphine - withdrawn rats showed a higher performance for 60% sucrose solution. Meanwhile, the morphine - withdrawn rats displayed a higher motivation to sexual stimulus during the free-approach test and more approaching behaviors towards sexual stimulus in a conflict-based approach test (concurrent presence of reward and aversive stimulus). No anhedonia -like behavior but sensitized behaviors for natural rewards were found after long-term morphine withdrawal. Notably, the morphine - withdrawn rats displayed persistent motivated behaviors for high-value rewards (60% sucrose and sexual stimulus) in the conflict tests suggesting impairments in inhibitory control in morphine - treated rats.",
  "28169492": "Comparison of biofilm formation and motility processes in arsenic - resistant Thiomonas spp. strains revealed divergent response to arsenite Bacteria of the genus Thiomonas are found ubiquitously in arsenic contaminated waters such as acid mine drainage (AMD), where they contribute to the precipitation and the natural bioremediation of arsenic. In these environments, these bacteria have developed a large range of resistance strategies among which the capacity to form particular biofilm structures. The biofilm formation is one of the most ubiquitous adaptive response observed in prokaryotes to various stresses, such as those induced in the presence of toxic compounds. This study focused on the process of biofilm formation in three Thiomonas strains (CB1, CB2 and CB3) isolated from the same AMD. The results obtained here show that these bacteria are all capable of forming biofilms, but the architecture and the kinetics of formation of these biofilms differ depending on whether arsenite is present in the environment and from one strain to another. Indeed, two strains favoured biofilm formation, whereas one favoured motility in the presence of arsenite. To identify the underlying mechanisms, the patterns of expression of some genes possibly involved in the process of biofilm formation were investigated in Thiomonas sp. CB2 in the presence and absence of arsenite, using a transcriptomic approach (RNA-seq). The findings obtained here shed interesting light on how the formation of biofilms, and the motility processes contribute to the adaptation of Thiomonas strains to extreme environments.",
  "28482033": "Long-term survival outcome after postoperative recurrence of non-small-cell lung cancer: who is ' cured ' from postoperative recurrence? Since survival after postoperative non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) recurrence is extremely poor, the long-term post - recurrence outcomes are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term post - recurrence outcomes and clarify who are possibly ' cured ' in recent clinical practice. We reviewed the medical records of 635 patients who developed postoperative recurrence until 2012 after R0 resection for pathological Stage IA-IIIA NSCLC between 1993 and 2006. Factors associated with post - recurrence surviva l (PRS) and the characteristics of the long-term (≥5 years) survivors were analysed retrospectively. The 5- year PRS rate of all 635 patients was 13%. Multivariable analysis revealed that female [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78], adenocarcinoma (HR = 0.77), locoregional (only) recurrence (HR = 0.59) and longer recurrence -free survival (HR = 0.99) were favourably associated with PRS. A total of 51 patients achieved 5- year PRS; however, 32 (63%) were cancer -bearing patients in their fifth post-recurrent year who were mainly treated by epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). Subsequent PRS curves for cancer - controlled and cancer -bearing groups were different (8- year PRS: 94% vs 31%, P = 0.003). Among 19 cancer - controlled patients in their fifth post-recurrent year, 17 (89%) patients initially received radical local therapy for their recurrence. Two-thirds of 5- year survivors after postoperative NSCLC recurrence had a cancer -bearing status and showed deteriorated subsequent survival. Curability of postoperative NSCLC recurrence should be evaluated in terms of the ' cancer - controlled ' status, and ' cured ' population is included in the patients who are ' cancer controlled ' at the fifth post-recurrent year.",

Two biosensor strains, Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens KYC55, were used to detect the quorum sensing (QS) activity of H. alvei H4 and to confirm the existence of AHL -mediated QS system. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high resolution triple quadrupole liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of the AHLs extracted from the culture supernatant of H. alvei H4 revealed the existence of at least three AHL s: N-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C8-HSL), and N-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). This is the first report of the production of C4-HSL by H. alvei. In order to determine the relationship between the production of AHL by H. alvei H4 and bacterial growth, the β-galactosidase assay was employed to monitor AHL activity during a 48-h growth phase. AHLs production reached a maximum level of 134.6 Miller unites at late log phase (after 18 h) and then decreased to a stable level of about 100 Miller unites. AHL production and bacterial growth displayed a similar trend, suggesting that growth of H. alvei H4 might be regulated by QS. The effect of AHLs on biofilm formation of H. alvei H4 was investigated by adding exogenous AHLs (C4-HSL, C6-HSL and 3-oxo-C8-HSL) to H. alvei H4 culture. Biofilm formation was significantly promoted (p < 0.05) by 5 and 10 µM C6-HSL, inhibited (p < 0.05) by C4-HSL (5 and 10 µM) and 5 µM 3-oxo-C8-HSL, suggesting that QS may have a regulatory role in the biofilm formation of H. alvei H4.",
  "28544492": "Epistatic influence in tomato Ve1 - mediated resistance Resistance to Verticillium wilt disease is associated with the tomato Ve-locus; however, the individual functional roles of Ve1 and Ve2 in host plants remain controversial. As a first step towards Ve mutational analyses in planta, the Ve1 coding region from a resistant tomato near-isoline (cv. Craigella GCR218) was introduced into a susceptible near-isoline (cv. Craigella GCR26). 35S:Ve1 plants segregated into two distinct classes; roughly half were resistant and half were susceptible. Ve1 transcript levels were upregulated in both classes compared to wild-type plants, showing stable transgenic expression. Expression analysis of Ve2 revealed that mRNA levels were similar between 35S:Ve1 and wild-type tomatoes, demonstrating that Ve1 transgene introduction does not alter endogenous Ve2 expression. Overall, the results of this study confirm the functional role of Ve1 protein in resistance to the vascular fungal pathogen V. dahliae race 1 (Vd1), but suggest that a yet undefined factor exerts an epistatic influence on the Ve1 gene.

  "27472389": "Dimerization of EGFR and HER2 induces breast cancer cell motility through STAT1 -dependent ACTA2 induction The dimerization of EGFR and HER2 is associated with poor prognosis such as induction of tumor growth and cell invasion compared to when EGFR remains as a homodimer. However, the mechanism for events after dimerization in breast cancer models is not clear. We found that expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) significantly increased with transient or stable overexpression of HER2 in EGFR - positive breast cancer cells. ACTA2 and STAT1 expression was also increased in HER2 - positive breast cancer patients. In contrast, ACTA2 expression was decreased by HER2 siRNA. Next, we investigated the co-relation between STAT1 and ACTA2 expression. Basal ACTA2 expression was significantly decreased by treatment with the STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine or the JAK2 inhibitor AG490. In contrast, ACTA2 expression was increased by STAT1 overexpression. Levels of ACTA2, STAT1, and HER2 were increased and relapse free survival was decreased in high-risk breast cancer patients. We also investigated the effect of ACTA2 on cell motility, which was suppressed by ACTA2 shRNA overexpression in MDA-MB231 HER2 and 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells. The number of lung metastatic nodules was significantly decreased in ACTA2 knockdown mice. Taken together, these results demonstrated that induction of ACTA2 by EGFR and HER2 dimerization was regulated through a JAK2 / STAT1 signaling pathway, and aberrant ACTA2 expression accelerated the invasiveness and metastasis of breast cancer cells.",
  "28159418": "The role of p62 / SQSTM1 in sporadic inclusion body myositis We examined selective autophagy against ubiquitinated protein aggregates in sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) patients. The form of autophagy requires phosphorylation of serine 403 in p62 / SQSTM1 to bind to Lys63 -linked ubiquitin and the binding of the p62 - ubiquitinated protein conjugates to LC3. In muscle biopsy specimens from 16 s-IBM patients, we compared the distribution of p62 (aa120-440) with 1) Ser403 - phosphorylated p62 (S403 - p p62), 2) Lys63 -linked ubiquitin and 3) LC3 in double-colour immunofluorescence microscopy. S403 - p p62, Lys63 -linked ubiquitin and LC3 colocalised with p62 aggregates, 79.05% ± 13.64% (mean ± SD), 66.54% ± 19.91% and 51.84% ± 14.1%, respectively. Although positive deposits of S403 - p p62 and Lys63 -linked ubiquitin were always observed within p62 aggregates, LC3 often showed dissociated distribution from p62. We also found fibres containing small, numerous p62 - positive dots that were negative for all three markers and were also observed in myositis controls. The results indicate that p62, Lys63 -linked ubiquitin and LC3 in s-IBM join to perform selective autophagy. p62 could be induced by some cellular stresses in all types of myositis; however, in s-IBM, compromised binding of the p62 - ubiquitinated protein complex to LC3 could stop the autophagy process in its initial stages, which causes the formation of aggregates of p62 - oligomers with Lys63 - ubiquitinated proteins.",
  "27869761": "Effect of Fusarium -Derived Metabolites on the Barrier Integrity of Differentiated Intestinal Porcine Epithelial Cells (IPEC-J2) The human, animal and plant pathogen Fusarium, which contaminates agricultural commodities worldwide, produces numerous secondary metabolites. An example is the thoroughly-investigated deoxynivalenol (DON), which severely impairs gastrointestinal barrier integrity. However, to date, the toxicological profile of other Fusarium -derived metabolites, such as enniatins, beauvericin, moniliformin, apicidin, aurofusarin, rubrofusarin, equisetin and bikaverin, are poorly characterized. Thus we examined their effects-as metabolites alone and as metabolites in combination with DON -on the intestinal barrier function of differentiated intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) over 72 h. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured at 24-h intervals, followed by evaluation of cell viability using neutral red (NR) assay. Enniatins A, A1, B and B1, apicidin, aurofusarin and beauvericin significantly reduced TEER. Moniliformin, equisetin, bikaverin and rubrofusarin had no effect on TEER. In the case of apicidin, aurofusarin and beauvericin, TEER reductions were further substantiated by the addition of otherwise no-effect DON concentrations. In all cases, viability was unaffected, confirming that TEER reductions were not due to compromised viability. Considering the prevalence of mycotoxin contamination and the diseases associated with intestinal barrier disruption, consumption of contaminated food or feed may have substantial health implications.",

Understanding the underlying mechanisms for estrogen synthesis and the microenvironment consisting of tumor and its surrounding adipose tissue might open new avenues in breast cancer prevention, prognosis and treatment. In order to obtain insight, we compared peritumoral and tumor tissue expressions of CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 genes, which play an important role in estrogen biosynthesis. The paired tissue samples of 20 postmenopausal ER(+) / PR(+) patients diagnosed with invasive ductal breast cancer were studied. In addition, 12 breast tissue samples obtained from premenopausal women without a history of breast cancer were also investigated as representative of normal conditions. Peritumoral adipose tissues expressed CYP19A1 approximately threefold higher than tumor itself (p = 0.001). A nonsignificant trend toward low expression of CYP17A1 was observed in peritumoral compared to tumor tissue (p = 0.687). Clinicopathological parameters and patient characteristics which are accepted as risk factors for breast cancer were also associated with individual and combined expressions of CYP17A1 and CYP19A1. This study offers that evaluation of CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 local expression levels might be useful for deciding on personalized treatment approaches and more accurate diagnosis, when evaluated together with several clinicopathological and disease risk factors. Considering the key role of these CYPs in estrogen synthesis, determining their expression levels may be useful as a postdiagnostic marker and for choosing the right treatment method in addition to the conventional approach.",

This study examined data from 391 subjects obtained from the 2008-2009 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). The KNHANES is a population-based, cross-sectional epidemiological survey. Participants aged 19 years or older completed standardized interviews and dilated ocular examinations, including measurement of intraocular pressure, visual fields with frequency doubling perimetry, and fundus photography. Data from the 361 patients with previously undiagnosed POAG were analyzed and compared with data from the 30 patients with previously diagnosed glaucoma. A total of 92.3% of POAG cases were undiagnosed before this study. Adjusted for age and sex, the strongest risk factor for undiagnosed glaucoma was longer elapsed time since last eye doctor visit. Glaucoma patients who had not visited an eye specialist in the last 3 years were 22 times (95% confidence interval, CI, 4.49-105.64, p < 0.001) more likely to have undiagnosed disease compared with patients who had visited an eye specialist in the last month. Another significant factor for previously undiagnosed glaucoma was smaller cup-to-disc ratio (odds ratio, OR, 0.60/0.1 units, 95% CI 0.43-0.85/0.1 units, p = 0.004). The higher vertical cup-to-disc ratio of a subject's two eyes was significantly different between those with previously undiagnosed (0.69) and diagnosed (0.78) POAG (p = 0.001).

A total of 200 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, ages 9-18 years, completed the DEPS-R Turkish version. In addition to tests of validity, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to investigate the factor structure of the 16-item Turkish version of DEPS-R. The Turkish version of DEPS-R demonstrated satisfactory Cronbach's ∝ (0.847) and was significantly correlated with ag e (r=0.194; p<0.01), hemoglobin A1c levels (r=0.303; p<0.01) and BMI - SDS (r=0.412; p<0.01) indicating criterion validity. Median DEPS-R scores of Turkish version for the total samples, females and males were as follows: 11.0, 11.5 and 10.5 respectively. Disturbed eating behaviors and insulin restriction were associated with poor metabolic control. A short, self-administered diabetes specific screening tool for disordered eating behavior can be used routinely in the clinical care of adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The Turkish version of DEPS-R is a valid screening tool for disordered eating behaviors in type 1 diabetes and it is potentially important to early detect disordered eating behaviors.",
  "28536031": "Lactate induces osteoblast differentiation by stabilization of HIF1α Aerobic glycolysis is involved in osteoblast differentiation induced by Wnt signaling or PTH treatment. However, it is still unclear whether lactate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, plays any role in osteoblast differentiation. Herein we report that in cultures of osteoblast-lineage cells, lactate promoted alkaline phosphatase -positive cell formation, increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, and induced the expression of osteocalcin. This osteoblast differentiation -inducing effect of lactate can be inhibited by blocking its entry into cells with MCT1 siRNA or inhibitors, and by interfering with its metabolism by using specific siRNAs for LDHB and PDH. Moreover, lactate stabilized HIF1α expression and inhibited HIF1α activity, with BAY87-2243 lowering the osteoblast differentiation -inducing effect of lactate. Thus, these findings reveal an unrecognized role for aerobic glycolysis in osteoblast differentiation via its end product, lactate.",

Oats might increase the nutritional value of a GFD, but their including is controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety of oats as part of a GFD in patients with celiac disease. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases for clinical trials and observational studies of the effects of including oats in GFD of patients with celiac disease. The studies reported patients ' symptoms, results from serology tests, and findings from histologic analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. We identified 433 studies; 28 were eligible for analysis. Of these, 6 were randomized and 2 were not-randomized controlled trials comprising a total of 661 patients -the remaining studies were observational. All randomized controlled trials used pure/uncontaminated oats. Oat consumption for 12 months did not affect symptoms (standardized mean difference: reduction in symptom scores in patients who did and did not consumed oats, -0.22; 95% CI: -0.56 to 0.13; P=.22), histologic scores (relative risk for histologic findings in patients who consumed oats, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.01 to 4.8; P=.35), intraepithelial lymphocyte counts (standardized mean difference: 0.21; 95% CI, reduction of 1.44 to increase in 1.86), or results from serologic tests. Subgroup analyses of adults vs children did not reveal differences. The overall quality of evidence was low. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found no evidence that addition of oats to a GFD affects symptoms, histology, immunity, or serologic features of patients with celiac disease. However, there were few studies for many endpoints, as well as limited geographic distribution and low quality of evidence. Rigorous double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials, using commonly available oats sourced from different regions, are needed.",
  "28540429": "Identification of markers for quiescent pancreatic stellate cells in the normal human pancreas Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a central role as source of fibrogenic cells in pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. In contrast to quiescent hepatic stellate cells (qHSCs), a specific marker for quiescent PSCs (qPSCs) that can be used in formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) normal human pancreatic tissue has not been identified. The aim of this study was to identify a marker enabling the identification of qPSCs in normal human FFPE pancreatic tissue. Immunohistochemical (IHC), double-IHC, immunofluorescence (IF) and double-IF analyses were carried out using a tissue microarray consisting of cores with normal human pancreatic tissue. Cores with normal human liver served as control. Antibodies directed against adipophilin, α-SMA, CD146, CRBP-1, cytoglobin, desmin, GFAP, nestin, S100A4 and vinculin were examined, with special emphasis on their expression in periacinar cells in the normal human pancreas and perisinusoidal cells in the normal human liver. The immunolabelling capacity was evaluated according to a semiquantitative scoring system. Double-IF of the markers of interest together with markers for other periacinar cells was performed. Moreover, the utility of histochemical stains for the identification of human qPSCs was examined, and their ultrastructure was revisited by electron microscopy. Adipophilin, CRBP-1, cytoglobin and vinculin were expressed in qHSCs in the liver, whereas cytoglobin and adipophilin were expressed in qPSCs in the pancreas. Adipophilin immunohistochemistry was highly dependent on the preanalytical time interval (PATI) from removal of the tissue to formalin fixation. Cytoglobin, S100A4 and vinculin were expressed in periacinar fibroblasts (FBs). The other examined markers were negative in human qPSCs. Our data indicate that cytoglobin and adipophilin are markers of qPSCs in the normal human pancreas. However, the use of adipophilin as a qPSC marker may be limited due to its high dependence on optimal PATI. Cytoglobin, on the other hand, is a sensitive marker for qPSCs but is expressed in FBs as well.",
  "28394042": "metabolic profiling of Parkinson's disease and mild cognitive impairment Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and mild cognitive impairment is important to enable prompt treatment and improve patient welfare, yet no standard diagnostic test is available. Metabolomics is a powerful tool used to elucidate disease mechanisms and identify potential biomarkers. The objective of this study was to use metabolic profiling to understand the pathoetiology of Parkinson's disease and to identify potential disease biomarkers. This study compared the serological metabolomic profiles of early-stage Parkinson's patients (diagnosed < 12 months) to asymptomatic matched controls using an established array based detection system (DiscoveryHD4™, Metabolon, UK), correlating metabolite levels to clinical measurements of cognitive impairment. A total of 1434 serological metabolites were assessed in early-stage Parkinson's disease cases (n = 41) and asymptomatic matched controls (n = 40). Post-quality control, statistical analysis identified n = 20 metabolites, predominantly metabolites of the fatty acid oxidation pathway, associated with Parkinson's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Receiver operator curve assessment confirmed that the nine fatty acid oxidation metabolites had good predictive accuracy (area under curve = 0.857) for early-stage Parkinson's disease and mild cognitive impairment (area under curve = 0.759). Our study indicates that fatty acid oxidation may be an important component in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and may have potential as a diagnostic biomarker for disease onset and mild cognitive impairment. © 2017 The Authors.

  "27933173": "A rare case of gestational thyrotoxicosis as a cause of acute myocardial infarction Angina pectoris in pregnancy is unusual and Prinzmetal's angina is much rarer. It accounts for 2% of all cases of angina. It is caused by vasospasm, but the mechanism of spasm is unknown but has been linked with hyperthyroidism in some studies. Patients with thyrotoxicosis - induced acute myocardial infarction are unusual and almost all reported cases have been associated with Graves' disease. Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone - induced hyperthyroidism occurs in about 1.4% of pregnant women, mostly when hCG levels are above 70-80 000 IU/L. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is transient and generally resolves spontaneously in the latter half of pregnancy, and specific antithyroid treatment is not required. Treatment with calcium channel blockers or nitrates reduces spasm in most of these patients. Overall, the prognosis for hyperthyroidism - associated coronary vasospasm is good. We describe a very rare case of an acute myocardial infarction in a 27- year-old female, at 9 weeks of gestation due to right coronary artery spasm secondary to gestational hyperthyroidism with free thyroxine of 7.7 ng/dL and TSH <0.07 IU/L. AMI and cardiac arrest due to GTT despite optimal medical therapy is extremely rare. Gestational hyperthyroidism should be considered in pregnant patients presenting with ACS -like symptoms especially in the setting of hyperemesis gravidarum .Our case highlights the need for increased awareness of general medical community that GTT can lead to significant cardiac events. Novel methods of controlling GTT as well as medical interventions like ICD need further study.",
  "28439067": "Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS)- induced Sertoli cell injury through a disruption of F-actin and microtubule organization is mediated by Akt1 / 2 PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonate, or perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) is an anthropogenic fluorosurfactant widely used in consumer products. While its use in Europe, Canada and the U.S. has been banned due to its human toxicity, it continues to be used in China and other developing countries as a global pollutant. Herein, using an in vitro model of Sertoli cell blood-testis barrier (BTB), PFOS was found to induce Sertoli cell injury by perturbing actin cytoskeleton through changes in the spatial expression of actin regulatory proteins. Specifically, PFOS caused mis-localization of Arp3 (actin-related protein 3, a branched actin polymerization protein) and palladin (an actin bundling protein). These disruptive changes thus led to a dis-organization of F-actin across Sertoli cell cytosol, causing truncation of actin microfilament, thereby failing to support the Sertoli cell morphology and adhesion protein complexes (e.g., occludin - ZO-1, CAR - ZO-1, and N-cadherin - ß-catenin), through a down-regulation of p-Akt1-S473 and p-Akt2-S474. The use of SC79, an Akt1 / 2 inhibitor, was found to block the PFOS - induced Sertoli cell injury by rescuing the PFOS - induced F-actin dis-organization. These findings thus illustrate PFOS exerts its disruptive effects on Sertoli cell function downstream through Akt1 / 2. As such, PFOS - induced male reproductive dysfunction can possibly be managed through an intervention on Akt1 / 2 expression.",
  "27569995": "Antidepressant -like effects of scopolamine in mice are enhanced by the group II mGlu receptor antagonist LY341495 Clinical studies have shown that the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine induces a potent and rapid antidepressant effect relative to conventional antidepressants. However, potential undesirable effects, including memory impairment, partially limit the use of scopolamine in psychiatry. In the present study, we propose to overcome these limitations and enhance the therapeutic effects of scopolamine via administration in combination with the group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor antagonist, LY341495. Joint administration of sub-effective doses of scopolamine (0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) with a sub-effective dose of LY341495 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) induced a profound antidepressant effect in the tail suspension test (TST) and in the forced swim test (FST) in mice. This drug combination did not impair memory, as measured using the Morris water maze (MWM), and did not influence the locomotor activity of mice. Furthermore, we found that an AMPA receptor antagonist, NBQX (10 mg/kg), completely reversed the antidepressant-like activity of a mixture of scopolamine and LY341495 in the TST. However, this effect was not influenced by para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) pre-treatment, indicating a lack of involvement of serotonergic system activation in the antidepressant-like effects of jointly given scopolamine and LY341495. Therefore, the combined administration of low doses of the antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the group II mGlu receptor antagonist LY341495 might be a new, effective and safe strategy in the therapy of depression.",
  "27555478": "Activation of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger in isolated cardiomyocytes through β-Raf dependent pathways. Role of Thr(653) of the cytosolic tail The mammalian Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is a ubiquitous plasma membrane protein that is a key regulator of intracellular pH in isolated cardiomyocytes. A 500 amino acid membrane domain removes protons and is regulated by a 315 amino acid cytosolic domain. In the myocardium, aberrant regulation of NHE1 contributes to ischemia reperfusion damage and to heart hypertrophy. We examined mechanisms of regulation of NHE1 in the myocardium by endothelin and β-Raf. Endothelin stimulated NHE1 activity and activated Erk-dependent pathways. Inhibition of β-Raf reduced NHE1 activity and Erk-pathway activation. We demonstrated that myocardial β-Raf binds to the C-terminal 182 amino acids of the NHE1 protein and that β-Raf is associated with NHE1 in intact cardiomyocytes. NHE1 was phosphorylated in vivo and the protein kinase inhibitor sorafenib reduced NHE1 phosphorylation levels. Immunoprecipitates of β-Raf from cardiomyocytes phosphorylated the C-terminal 182 amino acids of NHE1 and mass spectrometry analysis showed that amino acid Thr(653) was phosphorylated. Mutation of this amino acid to Ala resulted in defective activity while mutation to Asp restored the activity. The results demonstrate that Thr(653) is an important regulator y amino acid of NHE1 that is activated through β-Raf dependent pathways by phosphorylation either directly or indirectly by β-Raf, and this affects NHE1 activity.",
  "27793676": "Hormonal and testicular changes in rats submitted to congenital hypothyroidism in early life The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of hypothyroidism induced by MMI, during gestation (G) or gestation plus lactation (GL) on testis and its relation with leptin in rats. Six to eight pups were killed at 90 days of age. For statistical analysis One-way ANOVA followed by the Holm-Sìdak post hoc test was used. Hypothyroidism resulted in a significant reduction in LH, FSH and testosterone and an increase in leptin serum levels (p < 0.04). There was a significant decrease in StAR, AR, FSHR, LHR, pSTAT3 and SOCS3 (p < 0.04) protein expression and in the fertility parameters (p < 0.04). We can conclude that hypothyroidism is associated with reduction of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis leading to a low fertility potential in these animals. This outcome could be a consequence of low pituitary stimulus and testicular response and probably are not related with leptin hormone since its signaling pathway is down-regulated in the testis.",

Following a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, a segment 7 liver lesion was visualized, accompanied by extensive peritoneal tumour deposits. An ultrasound guided liver biopsy was performed and histology showed loose nests and sheets of tumour cells with a small blue round cell morphology. The tumour cells showed patchy strong immunopositivity for cytokeratins (AE1/3, CK7, CK19) and synaptophysin, while showing diffuse strong perinuclear positivity for desmin. Interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) study using EWSR1 breakapart probe was positive for EWSR1 gene rearrangement. Desmoplastic small round cell tumour is a rare but aggressive intra-abdominal mesenchymal tumour. While the primary sites of involvement are usually the peritoneum and omentum, visceral involvement can occur. We wish to highlight the importance of considering this entity when evaluating a liver biopsy especially in a less than classical clinical context.",
  "27883264": "Mucosa - associated biohydrogenating microbes protect the simulated colon microbiome from stress associated with high concentrations of poly-unsaturated fat Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may affect colon microbiome homeostasis by exerting (specific) antimicrobial effects and/or interfering with mucosal biofilm formation at the gut mucosal interface. We used standardized batch incubations and the Mucosal-Simulator of the Human Microbial Intestinal Ecosystem (M-SHIME) to show the in vitro luminal and mucosal effects of the main PUFA in the Western diet, linoleic acid (LA). High concentrations of LA were found to decrease butyrate production and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii numbers dependent on LA biohydrogenation to vaccenic acid (VA) and stearic acid (SA). In faecal batch incubations, LA biohydrogenation and butyrate production were positively correlated and SA did not inhibit butyrate production. In the M-SHIME, addition of a mucosal environment stimulated biohydrogenation to SA and protected F. prausnitzii from inhibition by LA. This was probably due to the preference of two biohydrogenating genera Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio for the mucosal niche. Co-culture batch incubations using Roseburia hominis and F. prausnitzii validated these observations. Correlations networks further uncovered the central role of Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio in protecting luminal and mucosal SHIME microbiota from LA - induced stress. Our results confirm how cross-shielding interactions provide resilience to the microbiome and demonstrate the importance of biohydrogenating, mucosal bacteria for recovery from LA stress.",
  "28322885": "Fluoride concentration in saliva and biofilm fluid following the application of three fluoride varnishes Most of the commercially available fluoride varnishes (FV) have not been evaluated for their cariostatic properties. Consequently, the aim of this in vivo study was to investigate intra - oral fluoride retention and clearance patterns from three different FV. Eighteen subjects (7-11 years) participated in a laboratory analyst - blinded, randomized, crossover study comparing the ability of 5% sodium fluoride varnishes (CavityShield-CS, Enamel Pro-EP, Vanish-V) to enhance fluoride concentrations in biofilm fluid, centrifuged and whole saliva over a period of 48h after a single FV application. Similar fluoride concentration × time patterns were noted for all investigated FV and studied variables, with the highest fluoride concentrations observed for the first biological sample collected after FV application (30min). Mean±SE (area under fluoride clearance curve) values were (μg F/g or ml×min): biofilm fluid - CS (472±191), EP (423±75), V (1264±279); centrifuged saliva - CS (42±7), EP (19±3), V (41±8); whole saliva - CS (68±11), EP (64±10), V (60±7). V delivered more fluoride to biofilm fluid than CS (p=0.0116) and EP (p=0.0065), which did not differ (p=0.27). For centrifuged saliva, CS and V were not significantly different (p=0.86), but resulted in higher fluoride retention than EP (p<0.0008). No significant differences among FV were observed for whole saliva (p=0.79). The present study has shown that FV vary in their ability to deliver fluoride intra - orally potentially related to formulation differences. To what extent the present findings relate to clinical efficacy remains, however, to be determined. Clinical research that investigates fluoride release patterns into saliva and biofilm fluid from different FV products is insufficient. More research is needed to investigate different FV formulations for their efficacy in order to help clinicians make better evidence based treatment choices.",
  "28343062": "The material, moral, and affective worlds of dealing and crime among young men entrenched in an inner city drug scene A large body of previous research has elucidated how involvement in drug dealing and crime among marginalized urban youth who use drugs is shaped by the imperatives of addiction and survival in the context of poverty. However, a growing body of research has examined how youth's involvement in these activities is shaped by more expansive desires and moralities. In this paper, we examine the material, moral, and affective worlds of loosely gang affiliated, street level dealing and crime among one group of young men in Vancouver, Canada. Drawing on longitudinal interviews with 44 young men from 2008 to 2016, and ethnographic fieldwork with a group of approximately 15 of those young men over the same time period, we argue that for these youth, dealing and crime were not solely about economic survival, or even the accrual of highly meaningful forms of \"street capital\" in the margins. Rather, as \"regimes of living,\" dealing and crime also opened up new value systems, moral logics, and affects in relation to the tremendous risks, potential rewards, and crushing boredom of life in the margins. These activities were also understood as a way into deeply desired forms of social spatial belonging in the city, which had previously only been imagined. However, across time dealing and crime ultimately \"embedded\" young men in cycles of incarceration, destitution, addictions, and mental health crises that ultimately reinforced their exclusion -from legal employment, but also within the world of crime. The findings of this study underscore the importance of adopting a life course perspective in order to meaningfully address the harms associated with involvement in dealing and crime among youth in our setting.",

One of the key factors that influences decision-making is expected patient survival. To our knowledge, no systematic reviews or meta-analysis have been conducted that review independent prognostic factors in spinal metastases. This study aimed to determine independent prognostic factors that affect outcome in patients with metastatic spine disease. This is a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of publications for prognostic factors in spinal metastatic disease. Pooled patient results from cohort and observational studies. Meta-analysis for poor prognostic factors as determined by hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidential interval (95% CI). We systematically searched relevant publications in PubMed and Embase. The following search terms were used: (\"' spinal metastases '\" OR \"' vertebral metastases '\" OR \" spinal metastasis \" OR ' vertebral metastases ') AND ('\" prognostic factors \"' OR \"' survival '\"). Inclusion criteria were prospective and retrospective cohort series that report HR and 95% CI of independent prognostic factors from multivariate analysis. Two reviewers independently assessed all papers. The quality of included papers was assessed by using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and publication bias was assessed by using funnel plot, Begg test, and Egger test. The prognostic factors that were mentioned in at least three publications were pooled. Meta-analysis was performed using HR and 95% CI as the primary outcomes of interest. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) method. A total of 3,959 abstracts (1,382 from PubMed and 2,577 from Embase) were identified through database search and 40 publications were identified through review of cited publications. The reviewers selected a total of 51 studies for qualitative synthesis and 43 studies for meta-analysis. Seventeen poor prognostic factors were identified. These included presence of a neurologic deficit before surgery, non-ambulatory status before radiotherapy (RT), non-ambulatory status before surgery, presence of bone metastases, presence of multiple bone metastases (>2 sites), presence of multiple spinal metastases (>3 sites), development of motor deficit in <7 days before initiating RT, development of motor deficit in <14 days before initiating RT, time interval from cancer diagnosis to RT <15 months, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) 10-40, KPS 50-70, KPS <70, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) grade 3-4, male gender, presence of visceral metastases, moderate growth tumor on Tomita score (TS) classification, and rapid growth tumor on TS classification. Seventeen independent poor prognostic factors were identified in this study. These can be categorized into cancer - specific and nonspecific prognostic factors. A tumor -based prognostic scoring system that combines all specific and general factors may enhance the accuracy of survival prediction in patients with metastatic spine disease.",

We sought to evaluate field implementation of Xpert among a cohort of HIV / TB co-infected individuals, including availability, utilization and outcomes. Observational cohort study (patient-level data) and cross-sectional study (site-level Xpert availability data). Data were collected at 30 participating International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) sites in 18 countries from January 2012- January 2016. All patients were HIV-infected and diagnosed with TB, either bacteriologically or clinically, and followed until a determination of TB treatment outcome. We used multivariable modified Poisson regression to estimate adjusted relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals for unfavorable TB treatment outcomes. Most sites (63%) had access to Xpert, either in the clinic (13%), in the same facility (20%) or offsite (30%). Among 2722 HIV / TB patients included, median age was 35.4 years and 41% were female; BMI and CD4 count were low. Overall, most patients (76%) received at least one TB test; 45% were positive. Only 4% of all patients were tested using Xpert: 64% were Xpert - positive, 13% showed rifampicin (RIF) resistance and 30% were extrapulmonary (EPTB) or both pulmonary - EPTB. Treatment outcomes were mostly favorable (77%) and we found little association between Xpert use and an unfavorable TB treatment outcome (RR 1.25, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.90). In this cohort, Xpert utilization was low even though the majority of sites had access to the test. Our findings show the need for expanded implementation and further research exploring barriers to use in low-resource settings.",
  "28317716": "A nano-delivery system for bioactive ingredients using supercritical carbon dioxide and its release behaviors For the purpose of ensuring the bioavailability of bioactive ingredients, a nano-delivery system with low toxicity was developed using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC - CO2). Compared to thin-film hydration (TFH), obtaining nano-scale liposomes is easier using SC - CO2. The characteristic of these liposomes was also demonstrated by the analysis of particle size and morphology. An in vitro release study showed that liposomes produced using SC - CO2 were resistant to low pH in simulated gastric conditions. In a simulated intestinal environment, enteric solubility of these liposomes was enhanced, which are important properties for controlled releasing bioactive ingredient. Furthermore, SC - CO2 -produced liposomes had a higher storage stability than those produced using TFH. Analysis of the organic solvent residue in the liposomes by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicated that SC - CO2 -produced liposomes had lower toxicity than those produced by TFH. A chemical free nano-delivery system using SC - CO2 has been revealed for storage and controlled release of bioactive ingredients.",

State Inpatient Databases for six states from 2011 to 2013 were used to identify patient cohorts for the six conditions used in the HRRP, which was augmented with hospital characteristic and HRRP penalty data. Hierarchical logistic regression models estimated hospital -level RSRRs for each condition, the reliability of each RSRR, and the extent to which socioeconomic and hospital factors further explain RSRR variation. We used publicly available data to estimate payments for excess readmissions in hospitals with reliable and unreliable RSRRs. Only RSRRs for surgical procedures exceeded the reliability benchmark for most hospitals, whereas RSRRs for medical conditions were typically below the benchmark. Additional adjustment for socioeconomic and hospital factors modestly explained variation in RSRRs. Approximately 25 percent of payments for excess readmissions were tied to unreliable RSRRs. Many of the RSRRs employed by the HRRP are unreliable, and one quarter of payments for excess readmissions are associated with unreliable RSRRs. Unreliable measures blur the connection between hospital performance and incentives, and threaten the success of the HRRP.",

For grapevines, this subject is relevant and need an urgent response because their wide distribution in semi-arid areas. New cultivars are difficult to introduce in viticulture due to the narrow dependency of consumer appreciation often linked to a certain particular wine taste. Clones of reputed cultivars would presumably be more accepted but little is known on the intra-cultivar genetic variability of the WUE. The present work compares, on the basis of two field assays, the variability of intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) in a large collection of cultivars in contrast with a collection of clones of Tempranillo cultivar. The results show that clonal variability of WUEi was around 80% of the inter-cultivar, thus providing a first assessment on the opportunity for clonal selection by WUE. Plotting the WUEi data against stem water potential or stomatal conductance it was possible to identify cultivars and clones out of the confidence intervals of this linear regression thus with significantly higher and lower WUEi values. The present results contribute to open the expectative for a genetic improvement of grapevine WUE.",
  "28284588": "Did Contraceptive Use Patterns Change after the Affordable Care Act? A Descriptive Analysis The Affordable Care Act (ACA) substantially increased rates of insurance coverage within the first year of implementation, including among women of reproductive age. The ACA also requires that private insurance plans cover contraceptives without any out-of-pocket costs. These provisions may have led more women to start using prescription contraception. We conducted two cross-sectional studies, collecting data from 8,062 women aged 18 to 39 in the fall 2012 and spring 2015. We examined contraceptive use patterns during both time periods. We used logistic regression to determine whether differences between the two time periods were significant, adjusting for the demographic characteristics of respondents. We observed no changes in contraceptive use patterns among sexually active women. However, use of the pill nearly doubled, from 21% to 40%, among young women aged 18 to 24 who had not had sex in the last month. Many of these women cited benefits of the pill in addition to pregnancy prevention. It may be that the ACA has yet to affect contraceptive use patterns, and it is possible that it will do so in the future, but the evidence thus far suggests the importance of further research into contraceptive access and sources of care.",
  "27778231": "Identification of potential predictive markers of dexamethasone resistance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia Response to dexamethasone (DEXA), as a hallmark drug in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), is one of the pivotal prognostic factors in the prediction of outcome in ALL. Identification of predictive markers of chemoresistance is beneficial to selecting of the best therapeutic protocol with the lowest effect adverse. Hence, we aimed to find drug targets using the 2DE / MS proteomics study of a DEXA - resistant cell line (REH) as a model for poor DEXA responding patients before and after drug treatment. Using the proteomic methods, three differentially expressed proteins were detected, including voltage dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), sorting Nexin 3 (SNX3), and prefoldin subunit 6 (PFDN6). We observed low expression of three proteins after DEXA treatment in REH cells. We subsequently verified low expression of resulted proteins at the mRNA level using the quantitative PCR method. These proteins are promising proteins because of their important roles in drug resistance and regulation of apoptosis (VDAC1), protein trafficking (SNX3), and protein folding (PFDN6). Additionally, mRNA expression level of these proteins was assessed in 17 bone marrow samples from children with newly diagnosed ALL and 7 non-cancerous samples as controls. The results indicated that independent of the molecular subtypes of leukemia, mRNA expression of VDAC1, SNX3, and PFDN6 decreased in ALL samples compared with non-cancerous samples particularly in VDAC1 (p < 0.001). Additionally, mRNA expression of three proteins was also declined in high-risk samples compared with standard risk cases. These results demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value of these proteins in childhood ALL. Furthermore, investigation of protein-protein interaction using STRING database indicated that these proteins involved in the signaling pathway of NR3C1 as dexamethasone target. In conclusion, our proteomic study in DEXA resistant leukemic cells revealed VDAC1, SNX3, and PFDN6 are promising proteins that might serve as potential biomarkers of prognosis and chemotherapy in childhood ALL.",
  "28056892": "Correlations between physical activity and neurocognitive domain functions in patients with schizophrenia: a cross-sectional study Neurocognitive dysfunction is a critical target symptom of schizophrenia treatment. A positive correlation between physical activity level and neurocognitive function has been reported in healthy individuals, but it is unclear whether such a correlation exists in patients with schizophrenia and whether the relationship is different according to inpatients or outpatients. This study aimed to examine the differences in the correlations between physical activity and multiple neurocognitive domains in inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia and obtain suggestions for further study to facilitate this field. Twenty-nine patients with schizophrenia were examined (16 inpatients and 13 outpatients, 56.0 ± 11.4 years of age). Current symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale and neurocognitive functions using Cognitrax, which yields a composite neurocognitive index (NCI) and 11 domain scores. After testing, participants wore an HJA-750C accelerometer for one week to measure physical activity levels and durations. Partial correlation analyses were performed between exercise and cognitive parameters. In the outpatient group, higher physical activity was associated with faster Motor and Psychomotor Speeds in outpatients. However, higher physical activity was associated with lower overall NCI, Attention score, and Memory scores in inpatients. Although higher physical activity was associated with better neurocognitive functions of outpatients, in inpatients with non-remitted schizophrenia, higher physical activity was associated with worsening of several cognitive domains. In a future study examining the relationship between physical activity and neurocognitive function for facilitating this research field, separation between inpatients and outpatients are needed because the relationship is different between inpatients and outpatients.",

We aimed to investigate the association between maternal hydronephrosis and flank pain intensity. From 2014 to 2015, all consecutive women with singleton pregnancies, who presented at our tertiary center due to acute flank pain, were prospectively evaluated by renal ultrasonography and pain questionnaires. A visual analogue scale was used to assess pain intensity. The study had 90% power to detect a significant correlation between hydronephrosis and flank pain (Spearman's test). A total of 51 consecutive women with left-sided (13.7%), right-sided (64.7%) or bilateral (21.6%) pain were enrolled. The mean gestational age of these women, who presented due to their pain, was 27.5 ± 6.8 weeks at the time of consultation. The mean VAS score was 7.6 ± 2.2. In 43/51 (84.3%) women, hydronephrosis was found on renal sonograms. No correlation was found between the grade of hydronephrosis and pain intensity (p = 0.466; r= -0.28). Women delivered at a mean gestational age of 38.1 ± 2.4 weeks and their infants had a mean birthweight of 3138 ± 677 g. Hydronephrosis is a common finding among pregnant women with acute flank pain. The grade of hydronephrosis does not affect pain intensity. This study suggests normal pregnancy outcomes in these women.",
  "28025021": "Inflammatory pain -related traits of sensory DRG neurons innervating the hip joints Hip pain is transmitted to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which contains two types of neurons with differential sensitivity to neurotrophic factors. If either type predominantly innervates the hip joint, it may represent a good target for hip joint pain treatment. Inflammation was induced in the left hip joint of rats (n = 10) by using complete Freund's adjuvant. Fluoro-Gold (FG) was applied to the hip joint after 7 days, and T12 - L6 DRGs were double-stained for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and isolection-IB4 1 week later. FG -labeled neurons in the control group were distributed throughout the left DRG from T13 to L5, primarily in L2 to L4, and CGRP -positive neurons were significantly more frequent than IB4 - binding neurons. In the inflammatory group, FG -labeled neurons were similarly distributed, primarily at L3 and L4, and CGRP -positive neurons were significantly more frequent than IB4 - binding neurons. The percentage of CGRP -positive neurons was significantly greater in the inflammatory group (P < 0.05). Most small neurons innervating the hip joint express CGRP. Furthermore, hip joint inflammation caused an increase in CGRP -positive neurons, but not in IB4 - binding neurons. Our results suggest that CGRP - expressing nerve growth factor -dependent neurons are primarily responsible for hip joint pain and may represent therapeutic targets.",
  "27798730": "Cost-effectiveness analysis of apatinib treatment for chemotherapy - refractory advanced gastric cancer Apatinib, a third-line or later treatment for advanced gastric cancer (aGC), was shown to improve overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in the phase III trial. Given the modest benefit with high costs, we further evaluated the cost-effectiveness of apatinib for patients with chemotherapy - refractory aGC. A Markov model was developed to simulate the disease process of aGC (PFS, progressive disease, and death) and estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of apatinib to placebo. The health outcomes and utility scores were derived from the phase III trial and previously published sources, respectively. Total costs were calculated from the perspective of the Chinese health-care payer. Sensitivity analysis was used to explore model uncertainties. Treatment with apatinib was estimated to provide an incremental 0.09 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $8113.86 compared with placebo, which resulted in an ICER of $90,154.00 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis showed that across the wide variation of parameters, the ICER exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold of $23,700.00 per QALY which was three times the Gross Domestic Product per Capita in China. Apatinib is not a cost-effective option for patients with aGC who experienced failure of at least two lines chemotherapy in China. However, for its positive clinical value and subliminal demand, apatinib can provide a new therapeutic option.",
  "27730636": "Assessment of interbreeding and introgression of farm genes into a small Scottish Atlantic salmon Salmo salar stock: ad hoc samples - ad hoc results? An eclectic set of tissues and existing data, including purposely collected samples, spanning 1997-2006, was used in an ad hoc assessment of hybridization and introgression of farmed wild Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in the small Loch na Thull (LnT) catchment in north-west Scotland. The catchment is in an area of marine farm production and contains freshwater smolt rearing cages. The LnT S. salar stock was found to be genetically distinctive from stocks in neighbouring rivers and, despite regular reports of feral farm S. salar, there was no evidence of physical or genetic mixing. This cannot be completely ruled out, however, and low level mixing with other local wild stocks has been suggested. The LnT population appeared underpinned by relatively smaller effective number of breeders (Neb) and showed relatively low levels of genetic diversity, consistent with a small effective population size. Small sample sizes, an incomplete farm baseline and the use of non-diagnostic molecular markers, constrain the power of the analysis but the findings strongly support the LnT catchment having a genetically distinct wild S. salar population little affected by interbreeding with feral farm escapes.",
  "27336239": "Professional reinventions: Swedish psychologists, 1990-2010 Since the early 20th century, the Swedish psychology profession has undergone several changes in its essential tasks, epistemological foundations, and social roles. These changes occurred through an ongoing \"tuning\" with Swedish society, in which the profession strove to appear relevant to society's concerns and problems as well as enroll others to share the profession's goals and aims. Studying the history of the profession can thus shed light on the changing definitions and contours of the psychology profession itself as well as on the organization of the society in which it acts. This article examines the history of the Swedish psychology profession from 1990 to 2010, through an analysis of the discussions and debates taking place in the Swedish Psychological Association's journal. The analytical framework used draws on work done within actor-network theory and science studies. We argue that the profession's institutional connections, defining tasks, epistemological underpinnings, and social position have changed in major ways during these 2 decades. Overall, as a result of an increasingly felt insecurity, the profession has turned outward and tried to find new ways to legitimize itself to politicians, the media, patients, and customers through means such as a more economized vocabulary and novel forms of empirical research. These changes have led to a more socialized profession, now more closely tuned to other actors in Swedish society, leading to conflicts within the profession over whether this is an opportunity to better control their own destiny or if it will lead to a loss of autonomy.

  "27583127": "Improved hematopoietic differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells via estrogen receptor signaling pathway Aside from its importance in reproduction, estrogen (E2) is known to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in rodents. However, the regulatory role of E2 in human hematopoietic system has not been investigated. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of E2 on hematopoietic differentiation using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). E2 improved hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs via estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α)-dependent pathway. During hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs, ER-α is persistently maintained and hematopoietic phenotypes (CD34 and CD45) were exclusively detected in ER-α positive cells. Interestingly, continuous E2 signaling is required to promote hematopoietic output from hPSCs. Supplementation of E2 or an ER-α selective agonist significantly increased the number of hemangioblasts and hematopoietic progenitors, and subsequent erythropoiesis, whereas ER-β selective agonist did not. Furthermore, ICI 182,780 (ER antagonist) completely abrogated the E2 -induced hematopoietic augmentation. Not only from hPSCs but also from human umbilical cord bloods, does E2 signaling potentiate hematopoietic development, suggesting universal function of E2 on hematopoiesis. Our study identifies E2 as positive regulator of human hematopoiesis and suggests that endocrine factors such as E2 influence the behavior of hematopoietic stem cells in various physiological conditions.",

We enrolled 219 H. pylori - infected patients, and randomly allocated patients to the EAC group (esomeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 200 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg for one week, with all drugs given twice daily) or RAC group (rabeprazole 10 mg, clarithromycin 200 mg, amoxicillin 750 mg for one week, with all drugs given twice daily). The H. pylori eradication rate according to the PP analyses was 75.0% (95% CI: 65.2-82.8%) in the EAC group and 71.4% (95% CI: 61.4-79.1%) in the RAC group. There were no statistically significant differences. The eradication rates of the clarithromycin -resistant /- sensitive strains were, respectively, 45.0% (95% CI: 30.7-60.2%)/98.0% (95% CI: 88.7-100%) in the EAC group and 39.5% (95% CI: 25.6-55.3%)/93.5% (95% CI: 81.9-98.4%) in the RAC group. The eradication rate of the clarithromycin - sensitive strains was significantly higher than that of the resistant strains in both groups. In conclusion, EAC and RAC therapies show a comparable efficacy regardless of the CYP2C19 genotype and clarithromycin susceptibility status in Japan.",

Schischk collected from Urumqi, Xinjiang province, north-west China. Growth occurred at 5-35 °C (optimum 30 °C), at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0), and in the presence of 0-6 % NaCl (w/v) (optimum 0-1 %). Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain EGI 6500337T formed a distinct lineage in the cluster that comprised the genera Aurantimonas and Aureimonas in the family Aurantimonadaceae. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain EGI 6500337T shared the highest similarities to those of Aurantimonas coralicida DSM 14790T (97.15 %) and Aurantimonas manganoxydans DSM 21871T (97.15 %).

  "28113116": "Metabolic Interference of sod gene mutations on catalase activity in Escherichia coli exposed to Gramoxone ® (paraquat) herbicide Herbicides are continuously used to minimize the loss of crop productivity in agricultural environments. They can, however, cause damage by inhibiting the growth of microbiota via oxidative stress, due to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cellular responses to ROS involve the action of enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). The objective of this study was to evaluate adaptive responses in Escherichia coli K-12 to paraquat, the active ingredient in the herbicide Gramoxone ®. Mutant bacterial strains carrying deletions in genes encoding Mn-SOD (sodA) and Fe-SOD (sodB) were used and resulted in distinct levels of hydrogen peroxide production, interference in malondialdehyde, and viability. Mutations also resulted in different levels of interference with the activity of CAT isoenzymes and in the inactivation of Cu/Zn-SOD activity. These mutations may be responsible for metabolic differences among the evaluated strains, resulting in different patterns of antioxidative responses, depending on mutation background. While damage to the Δ sodB strain was minor at late log phase, the reverse was true at mid log phase for the Δ sodA strain. These results demonstrate the important role of these genes in defense against oxidative stress in different periods of growth. Furthermore, the lack of Cu/Zn-SOD activity in both mutant strains indicated that common metal cofactors likely interfere in SOD activity regulation. These results also indicate that E. coli K-12, a classical non-environmental strain, constitutes a model of phenotypic plasticity for adaptation to a redox-cycling herbicide through redundancy of different isoforms of SOD and CAT enzymes.",

However, subsequent hypovolemia (HOV) may be accompanied by a decrease of anemia tolerance, resulting in increased transfusion needs. We therefore investigated the effect of volume status on anemia tolerance. Eighteen domestic pigs of either sex (mean weight, 23.5 ± 4.8 kg) were anesthetized, ventilated, and randomized into three experimental groups: normovolemia (no intervention), HOV (blood loss of 40% of blood volume), and hypervolemia (HEV; volume infusion of 40% of blood volume). The animals were then hemodiluted until their individual critical hemoglobin concentrations (Hbcrit) were reached by the exchange of whole blood for hydroxyethyl starch (HES; 130:0.4). Subsequently, organ-specific hypoxia was assessed using pimonidazole tissue staining in relevant organs. Hemodynamic and metabolic variables were also investigated. Despite significant differences in exchangeable blood volume, Hbcrit was the same in all groups (2.3 g/dL, NS). During HOV, tissue hypoxia was aggravated in the myocardium, brain, and kidneys, whereas tissue oxygenation of the liver and intestine was not influenced by volume status. HEV increased tissue hypoxia in the lungs, but did not impact tissue oxygenation of other organs. The combination of hemorrhagic HOV with subsequent anemia leads to accentuated tissue hypoxia, revealed by a significant increase in pimonidazole binding at Hbcrit, in heart, lungs, brain, and kidney. The lungs were the only organ that showed increased tissue hypoxia after pretreatment of HES infusion and subsequent anemia by normovolemic hemodilution.",

Curcumin has promising antifungal activity in comparison with the existing azole antifungal drugs. Bioadhesive curcumin vaginal tablets were prepared by direct compression with different ratios of biadhesive polymers like xanthan gum, guar gum and HPMC. Curcumin tablets were characterized by studies of friability, hardness, hydration, DSC, mucoadhesion, In-vitro release and antifungal activity. DSC and FT-IR data indicate there was no interaction between the drug and the excipients and also polymer concentration has some effects on melting point of curcumin. Formulation F3 showed the best results in terms of swelling and mucoadhesion together with prolonged drug release. The antifungal activity of the Curcumin tablet has demonstrated a significant effect against Candida albicans. Hence, the study indicates the possible and effective use of curcumin bioadhesive monolithic vaginal tablet for vaginal candidiasis as a promising natural antifungal treatment.",

Vascular co-morbidities can be seen when examining arterial stiffness (AS), which is a predictor for endothelial health and cardiovascular disease risk. Pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) are two tests that are commonly used to measure AS. Currently, disease states and progression are tracked via blood biochemistry. These gold standards in monitoring diabetes are expensive and need optimization. To investigate which biophysical and biochemical parameters correlated best with AS, which may reduce the number of biochemical tests and biophysical parameter measurements needed to track disease progression. Data from 42 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus for ≤10 years, aged 40-70 years, were analyzed at a single time point. We investigated various blood biochemistry, body composition, and AS parameters. A combination of fat mass and fat-free mass was most associated with PWA over any other parameters. Leptin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein seem to be the next two parameters that correlate with augmentation index. No other parameters had strong correlations to either PWA or PWV values. Body composition methods seemed to be better predictors of type 2 diabetes mellitus patient's vascular disease progression. Our study indicates that body composition measurements may help replace expensive tests. This may have public health and health surveillance implications in countries facing financial challenges.",

The architecture extends the single-bus address-event representation protocol to a hierarchy of multiple nested buses, routing events across increasing scales of spatial distance. The HiAER protocol provides individually programmable axonal delay in addition to strength for each synapse, lending itself toward biologically plausible neural network architectures, and scales across a range of hierarchies suitable for multichip and multiboard systems in reconfigurable large-scale neuromorphic systems. We show approximately linear scaling of net global synaptic event throughput with number of routing nodes in the network, at $3.6x10^7$ synaptic events per second per 16k- neuron node in the hierarchy.",

We report on one of these rare cases. The case history of a 73-year-old white man stated that he had a carcinoma of the oropharynx, which was primarily treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy 4 years prior. As a result of radiotherapy he developed an osteoradionecrosis of his mandible and a consecutive pathological fracture of his left mandibular angle. Subsequent osteosynthesis was performed with a reconstruction plate. When we first saw him, his reconstruction plate was partially exposed with intraoral and extraoral fistulation. The resected bone of his defect-bordering jaw showed the typical pathohistological findings of an intraosseous mandibular pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia. After a first reconstruction attempt with an iliac crest graft failed, definitive reconstruction of his mandible with a microvascular anastomosed fibula graft was achieved. Intraosseous pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of the mandible is a rare differential diagnosis in maxillofacial surgery. Besides other benign epithelial neoplasms, such as calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, squamous odontogenic tumor, or different forms of ameloblastoma, the far more frequent invasive squamous cell carcinoma needs to be excluded. A misinterpretation of pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia as squamous cell carcinoma must be avoided because it can lead to a massive overtreatment.",

Our aim was to determine whether genetic variation of C5 was associated with ischemic stroke (IS) in northeast Chinese population. We used a case-control study involving 386 IS patients and 386 non-IS controls from a rural population and determined the genotypes of five polymorphisms (rs12237774, rs17611, rs4837805, rs7026551, and rs1017119) of C5 gene by Snapshot single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays to assess any links with IS. In univariate analysis, rs17611 was significantly associated with IS in the additive model, the dominant model, and recessive model (additive p 0.031, dominant p 0.034, and recessive p 0.027). After adjustment for Binary Logistic Regression, rs17611 polymorphism was still significant in three models (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.306, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.069-1.595, p-value = 0.009 in an additive model; OR = 1.378, 95% CI = 1.024-1.856, p-value = 0.035 in a dominant model; and OR = 1.511, 95% CI = 1.048-2.18, p-value = 0.027 in a recessive model).

We aimed to assess HRQoL in a national cohort of young adolescents born very preterm, and to identify predictors for poorer HRQoL. All surviving Swiss live-born children below 30weeks of gestation during the year 2000 (290 subjects) were contacted at age 12years, together with their parents (262 families). HRQoL of the study children was assessed using both the Kidscreen-27 (KS-27) self- and parent forms. Neonatal data of the cohort were prospectively collected. Among the contacted families, 176 returned the complete set of questionnaires for 194 adolescents (67%): 100 (51%) females, mean (range) gestational age was 27.8 (24.1-29.9) weeks, birth weight 1025 (420-1730) grams, mean age at assessment 12.0 (11.0-13.0) years.

Because cnidarian genomes are conventional in terms of protein-coding genes, their remarkable features are likely a consequence of epigenetic regulation. To facilitate epigenetics research in cnidarians, we analysed the histone complement of the cnidarian model organism Hydractinia echinata using phylogenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and mRNA in situ hybridisations. We find that the Hydractinia genome encodes 19 histones and analyse their spatial expression patterns, genomic loci and replication -dependency. Alongside core and other replication - independent histone variants, we find several histone replication -dependent variants, including a rare replication -dependent H3.3, a female germ cell - specific H2A.X and an unusual set of five H2B variants, four of which are male germ cell - specific. We further confirm the absence of protamines in Hydractinia. Since no protamines are found in hydroids, we suggest that the novel H2B variants are pivotal for sperm DNA packaging in this class of Cnidaria. This study adds to the limited number of full histone gene complements available in animals and sets a comprehensive framework for future studies on the role of histones and their post-translational modifications in cnidarian epigenetics.

  "28450207": "Drug release studies from lipid nanoparticles in physiological media by a new DSC method Lipid nanoparticles are an interesting parenteral delivery system for poorly water-soluble drugs. In order to approach physiological conditions when conducting release studies from such systems the release media should preferentially contain lipophilic acceptor compartments such as lipoproteins or other colloidal lipophilic components. In practice, drug release studies under such close to physiological conditions may be complicated by the small size of lipid nanoparticles, which is in the same range as that of the potential acceptor particles. This study describes a novel differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method for drug release measurements which works without separation of donor and acceptor particles. The technique is based on measuring the crystallization temperature of trimyristin nanoparticles by DSC. The crystallization temperature of the nanoparticles decreases proportionally with the amount of active ingredient incorporated and thus increases as a result of drug release. Liquid trimyristin nanoparticles loaded with fenofibrate, orlistat, tocopherol acetate and ubidecarenone were studied in three different release media with increasing complexity and comparability to physiological conditions: a rapeseed oil nanoemulsion, porcine serum and porcine blood. Using the new method, a correlation between release behavior and drug lipophilicity was observed: the higher the logP value of the drug, the slower the release. The extent of drug release was influenced by partition equilibrium as indicated by increased drug release in the rapeseed oil nanoemulsion compared to porcine serum and blood.",
  "27905097": "Novel biomarkers in primary breast core biopsies to predict poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and appearance of metastases Drug resistance has been one of the major obstacles limiting the success of cancer chemotherapy. In two thirds of breast cancer patients, large (>1cm) residual tumors are present after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). The residual tumor and involved nodes have been indicators of relapse and survival very important in breast cancer. The goal of this preliminary study was to assess the predictive significance of a panel of molecular biomarkers, related with the response to treatment or drug resistance to NCT, as determined on the diagnostic tumor. The expression of 22 proteins was examined using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays (TMA) from 115 patients of stage II - III breast cancer, treated with NCT. Among studied proteins, there are some that are anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative, cancer stem cell markers and the Vitamin D Receptor. Other proteins are involved in the identification of molecular subtype, cell cycle regulation or DNA repair. Next, a predictive signature of poor response was generated from independent markers of predictive value. Tumors that expressed four or five conditions (biomarkers of chemoresistance with a determinated cutoff) were associated with a 9-fold increase in the chances of these patients of having a poor response to NCT. Additionally, we also found a worse prognostic signature, generated from independent markers of prognostic value. Tumors which expressed two or three conditions of worst prognostic, were associated with a 6-fold reduction in Distant Disease Free Survival. In conclusion, finding biomarkers of chemoresitance (ypTNM II-III) and metastases can become a stepping stone for future studies that will need to be assessed in a bigger scale.",

Two distinct PPT design variants (open vs. occluded drug application) are commonly used, but no previous work has aimed to directly compare and contrast their performance. We compared the antipsoriatic efficacy of mapracorat 0.1% ointment and reference drugs reported in 2 separate studies, representing open and occluded PPT designs. The drug effect size was measured by sonography (mean change in echo-poor band thickness), chromametry, and standardized clinical assessment. Antipsoriatic effects were detectable for the study drugs in both occluded and open PPTs. Differences between the potency of antipsoriatic drugs and vehicle were observable. The total antipsoriatic effect size appeared to be higher in the occluded PPT than the open PPT, despite the shorter treatment duration (2 vs. 4 weeks). Effect dynamics over time revealed greater differences between some study drugs in the open PPT compared to the occluded PPT. Taking the higher technical challenges for the open PPT into account, we recommend the occluded PPT as a standard screening setting in early drug development. In special cases, considering certain drug aspects or study objectives that would require procedural adaptations, an open PPT could be the better-suited design. Finally, both PPT models show clear advantages: classification as phase I studies, small number of psoriatic subjects, relatively short study duration, excellent discrimination between compounds and concentrations, parallel measurement of treatment response, and go/no go decisions very early in clinical development.",

This study examines the reliability of a popular sharp-interface analytical approach for estimating the extent of sea water in a homogeneous coastal aquifer subjected to pumping and regional flow effects and under steady-state conditions. The analytical model is tested against observations from Canada, the United States, and Australia to assess its utility as an initial approximation of sea water extent for the purposes of rapid groundwater management decision making. The occurrence of sea water intrusion resulting in increased salinity at pumping wells was correctly predicted in approximately 60% of cases. Application of a correction to account for dispersion did not markedly improve the results. Failure of the analytical model to provide correct predictions can be attributed to mismatches between its simplifying assumptions and more complex field settings. The best results occurred where the toe of the salt water wedge is expected to be the closest to the coast under predevelopment conditions. Predictions were the poorest for aquifers where the salt water wedge was expected to extend further inland under predevelopment conditions and was therefore more dispersive prior to pumping. Sharp-interface solutions remain useful tools to screen for the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to sea water intrusion, although the significant sources of uncertainty identified in this study require careful consideration to avoid misinterpreting sharp-interface results.",
  "28152029": "Clonal and serotype dynamics of serogroup 6 isolates causing invasive pneumococcal disease in Portugal: 1999-2012 Although serogroup 6 was among the first to be recognized among Streptococcus pneumoniae, several new serotypes were identified since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). A decrease of the 6B-2 variant among invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), but not 6B-1, was noted post conjugate vaccine introduction, underpinned by a decrease of CC273 isolates. Serotype 6C was associated with adult IPD and increased in this age group representing two lineages (CC315 and CC395), while the same lineages expressed other serogroup 6 serotypes in children. Taken together, these findings suggest a potential cross-protection of PCVs against serotype 6C IPD among vaccinated children but not among adults. Serotype 6A became the most important serogroup 6 serotype in children but it decreased in adult IPD. No other serogroup 6 serotypes were detected, so available phenotypic or simple genotypic assays remain adequate for distinguishing serotypes within serogroup 6 isolates.",
  "27486082": "Single-cell analyses of X Chromosome inactivation dynamics and pluripotency during differentiation Pluripotency, differentiation, and X Chromosome inactivation (XCI) are key aspects of embryonic development. However, the underlying relationship and mechanisms among these processes remain unclear. Here, we systematically dissected these features along developmental progression using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and single-cell RNA sequencing with allelic resolution. We found that mESCs grown in a ground state 2i condition displayed transcriptomic profiles diffused from preimplantation mouse embryonic cells, whereas EpiStem cells closely resembled the post-implantation epiblast. Sex -related gene expression varied greatly across distinct developmental states. We also identified novel markers that were highly enriched in each developmental state. Moreover, we revealed that several novel pathways, including PluriNetWork and Focal Adhesion, were responsible for the delayed progression of female EpiStem cells. Importantly, we \" digitalized \" XCI progression using allelic expression of active and inactive X Chromosomes and surprisingly found that XCI states exhibited profound variability in each developmental state, including the 2i condition. XCI progression was not tightly synchronized with loss of pluripotency and increase of differentiation at the single-cell level, although these processes were globally correlated. In addition, highly expressed genes, including core pluripotency factors, were in general biallelically expressed. Taken together, our study sheds light on the dynamics of XCI progression and the asynchronicity between pluripotency, differentiation, and XCI.",
  "28112685": "Chemogenetic stimulation of striatal projection neurons modulates responses to Parkinson's disease therapy Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experience loss of normal motor function (hypokinesia), but can develop uncontrollable movements known as dyskinesia upon treatment with L-DOPA. Poverty or excess of movement in PD has been attributed to overactivity of striatal projection neurons forming either the indirect (iSPNs) or the direct (dSPNs) pathway, respectively. Here, we investigated the two pathways ' contribution to different motor features using SPN type-specific chemogenetic stimulation in rodent models of PD (PD mice) and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID mice). Using the activatory Gq-coupled human M3 muscarinic receptor (hM3Dq), we found that chemogenetic stimulation of dSPNs mimicked, while stimulation of iSPNs abolished the therapeutic action of L-DOPA in PD mice. In LID mice, hM3Dq stimulation of dSPNs exacerbated dyskinetic responses to L-DOPA, while stimulation of iSPNs inhibited these responses. In the absence of L-DOPA, only chemogenetic stimulation of dSPNs mediated through the Gs-coupled modified rat muscarinic M3 receptor (rM3Ds) induced appreciable dyskinesia in PD mice. Combining D2 receptor agonist treatment with rM3Ds-dSPN stimulation reproduced all symptoms of LID. These results demonstrate that dSPNs and iSPNs oppositely modulate both therapeutic and dyskinetic responses to dopamine replacement therapy in PD. We also show that chemogenetic stimulation of different signaling pathways in dSPNs leads to markedly different motor outcomes. Our findings have important implications for the design of effective antiparkinsonian and antidyskinetic drug therapies.",

Mexico lacks regulations in this matter, affecting national and international trade from agroindustry. The aim of this study was to diagnose pesticide residues in oranges from Nuevo Leon, México, in citrus orchards. In May 2014, 100 orange fruit samples were taken randomly from orchards and subjected to analysis for 93 pesticides at residual level by GC / QQQ-MS and LCQ-TOF-MS. Results showed the presence of 15 pesticide residues in the samples. The comparison of the residual levels of pesticides found in orange samples among the MRLs allowed by USA, EU and Japanese regulations demonstrated that all samples were below MRLs issued by USA and Japan. Some orange samples were above MRLs issued by the EU. This provides a basis to establish strategies in order to satisfy International Standards to protect human health and encourage Food Safety in Mexico.",

This problem is frequently marginalized or even ignored by parents / guardians, what affects child's whole further life. The assessment of parents' knowledge concerning oral hygiene and prevention of dental caries in infants and young children. The test group consisted of parents, as well as men and women currently expecting a child. The study was conducted in a form of a survey, using an original questionnaire, which was carried out in several hospitals in Lodz and online, on a popular local forum for parents. The data obtained were analyzed statistically, allowing the assessment of health awareness of respondents and the creation of various profiles of parental knowledge on the subject investigated. Most of respondents knew the age at which milk and permanent teeth erupt, gave the correct frequency of brushing child's teeth and were in favor of limiting sweets in the diet. A total of 59% correctly gave the number of deciduous teeth and 66% had heard of the \" bottle tooth decay \". All respondents thought that helping and controlling a child while brushing their teeth is indispensable, but they did not know the best time to start using the toothpaste with fluoride. The information about child's oral hygiene was more often looked for by women (67%) than by men (29%). The study also showed that if a training on the given subject was organized, 60% of respondents would be willing to participate in it. In the test group, pro-health awareness is insufficient to maintain the oral health of the offspring and requires constant developing. oral health behaviors, oral health, prophylaxis of dental caries, parent questionnaire survey.",
  "28466379": "Bayesian and Phylogenic Approaches for Studying Relationships among Table Olive Cultivars To enhance table olive tree authentication, relationship, and productivity, we consider the analysis of 18 worldwide table olive cultivars (Olea europaea L.) based on morphological, biological, and physicochemical markers analyzed by bioinformatic and biostatistic tools. Accordingly, we assess the relationships between the studied varieties, on the one hand, and the potential productivity - quantitative parameter links on the other hand. The bioinformatic analysis based on the graphical representation of the matrix of Euclidean distances, the principal components analysis, unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed three major clusters which were not correlated with the geographic origin. The statistical analysis based on Kendall's and Spearman correlation coefficients suggests two highly significant associations with both fruit color and pollinization and the productivity character. These results are confirmed by the multiple linear regression prediction models. In fact, based on the coefficient of determination (R (2)) value, the best model demonstrated the power of the pollinization on the tree productivity (R (2) = 0.846). Moreover, the derived directed acyclic graph showed that only two direct influences are detected: effect of tolerance on fruit and stone symmetry on side and effect of tolerance on stone form and oil content on the other side. This work provides better understanding of the diversity available in worldwide table olive cultivars and supplies an important contribution for olive breeding and authenticity.",
  "27825443": "Natural competence for transformation While most molecular biologists are familiar with the artificial transformation of bacteria in the context of laboratory cloning experiments, natural competence for transformation refers to a specific physiological state in which prokaryotes are able to take up genetic material from their surroundings. Occasionally, such absorbed DNA is recombined into the organism's own genome, resulting in natural transformation (Figure 1). As a consequence, natural competence for transformation is considered a primary mode of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in prokaryotes, together with conjugation (direct cell to cell transfer of DNA via a specialized conjugal pilus) and phage transduction (DNA transfer mediated by viruses). HGT plays a major role in bacterial evolution, and past research has demonstrated that HGT, including natural competence for transformation, contributes to the emergence of pathogens and the spread of virulence factors. Indeed, Frederick Griffith discovered natural competence for transformation in 1928 while he was investigating the exchange of pathogenic traits in pneumococci. Due to the increase in the abundance and spread of multidrug-resistant microbes, research on HGT is even more important today than ever before.",
  "27683416": "Prolyl-4-hydroxylase 2 and 3 coregulate murine erythropoietin in brain pericytes A classic response to systemic hypoxia is the increased production of red blood cells due to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated induction of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is a glycoprotein hormone that is essential for normal erythropoiesis and is predominantly synthesized by peritubular renal interstitial fibroblast-like cells, which express cellular markers characteristic of neuronal cells and pericytes. To investigate whether the ability to synthesize EPO is a general functional feature of pericytes, we used conditional gene targeting to examine the von Hippel-Lindau / prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD)/HIF axis in cell - expressing neural glial antigen 2, a known molecular marker of pericytes in multiple organs. We found that pericytes in the brain synthesized EPO in mice with genetic HIF activation and were capable of responding to systemic hypoxia with the induction of Epo. Using high-resolution multiplex in situ hybridization, we determined that brain pericytes represent an important cellular source of Epo in the hypoxic brain (up to 70% of all Epo - expressing cells). We furthermore determined that Epo transcription in brain pericytes was HIF-2 dependent and cocontrolled by PHD2 and PHD3, oxygen - and 2-oxoglutarate -dependent prolyl-4-hydroxylases that regulate HIF activity. In summary, our studies provide experimental evidence that pericytes in the brain have the ability to function as oxygen sensors and respond to hypoxia with EPO synthesis. Our findings furthermore suggest that the ability to synthesize EPO may represent a functional feature of pericytes in the brain and kidney.",
  "28149055": "Computational analysis of conserved coil functional residues in the mitochondrial genomic sequences of dermatophytes Dermatophyte is a group of closely related fungi that have the capacity to invade keratinized tissue of humans and other animals. The infection known as dermatophytosis, caused by members of the genera Microsporum, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton includes infection to the groin (tinea cruris), beard (tinea barbae), scalp (tinea capitis), feet (tinea pedis), glabrous skin (tinea corporis), nail (tinea unguium), and hand (tinea manuum). The identification of evolutionary relationship between these three genera of dermatophyte is epidemiologically important to understand their pathogenicity. Mitochondrial DNA evolves more rapidly than a nuclear DNA due to higher rate of mutation but is very less affected by genetic recombination, making it an important tool for phylogenetic studies. Thus, here we present a novel scheme to identify the conserved coil functional residues of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum and Microsporum canis. Protein coding sequences of the mitochondrial genome were aligned for their similar sequences and homology modelling was performed for structure and pocket identification. The results obtained from comparative analysis of the protein sequences revealed the presence of functionally active sites in all the species of the genera Trichophyton and Microsporum. However in Epidermophyton floccosum it was observed in three protein sequences of the five studied. The absence of these conserved coil functional residues in E. floccusum may be correlated with lesser infectivity of this organism. The functional residues identified in the present study could be responsible for the disease and thus can act as putative target sites for drug designing.",
  "28260547": "Surrogate inaccuracy in predicting older adults' desire for life-sustaining interventions in the event of decisional incapacity: is it due in part to erroneous quality-of-life assessments? Family members are often called upon to make decisions for an incapacitated relative. Yet they have difficulty predicting a loved one's desire to receive treatments in hypothetical situations. We tested the hypothesis that this difficulty could in part be explained by discrepant quality-of-life assessments. The data come from 235 community-dwelling adults aged 70 years and over who rated their quality of life and desire for specified interventions in four health states (current state, mild to moderate stroke, incurable brain cancer, and severe dementia). All ratings were made on Likert-type scales. Using identical rating scales, a surrogate chosen by the older adult was asked to predict the latter's responses. Linear mixed models were fitted to determine whether differences in quality-of-life ratings between the older adult and surrogate were associated with surrogates' inaccuracy in predicting desire for treatment. The difference in quality-of-life ratings was a significant predictor of prediction inaccuracy for the three hypothetical health states (p < 0.01) and nearly significant for the current health state (p = 0.077). All regression coefficients were negative, implying that the more the surrogate overestimated quality of life compared to the older adult, the more he or she overestimated the older adult 's desire to be treated. Discrepant quality-of-life ratings are associated with surrogates' difficulty in predicting desire for life-sustaining interventions in hypothetical situations. This finding underscores the importance of discussing anticipated quality of life in states of cognitive decline, to better prepare family members for making difficult decisions for their loved ones.

  "27414407": "Learning Is Better with the Hands Free: The Role of Posture in the Memory of Manipulable Objects Grounded cognition proposes that memory shares processing resources with sensorimotor systems. The aim of the present study was to show that motor simulation participates in the conceptual representation of manipulable objects in long-term memory. In two experiments, lists of manipulable and nonmanipulable objects were presented. Participants were instructed to memorize the items while adopting different postures. In the control condition, they had to keep their hands at rest in front of them. In the interference condition, participants had to keep their hands crossed behind their back to make their hands less free for action. After each list, participants had to perform first a distractive task, and then an oral free recall. The results showed that the interfering posture produced a specific decrease in the recall of manipulable objects, but not of nonmanipulable ones. This decrease was similar when the items were presented as pictures (Experiment 1) or as words (Experiment 2), thus excluding a purely visual effect. These results provide strong evidence that the motor simulation plays a role in the memory trace of the object.",

  "28101523": "Spatial Mnemonic Encoding: Theta Power Decreases and Medial Temporal Lobe BOLD Increases Co-Occur during the Usage of the Method of Loci The method of loci is one, if not the most, efficient mnemonic encoding strategy. This spatial mnemonic combines the core cognitive processes commonly linked to medial temporal lobe (MTL) activity: spatial and associative memory processes. During such processes, fMRI studies consistently demonstrate MTL activity, while electrophysiological studies have emphasized the important role of theta oscillations (3-8 Hz) in the MTL. However, it is still unknown whether increases or decreases in theta power co-occur with increased BOLD signal in the MTL during memory encoding. To investigate this question, we recorded EEG and fMRI separately, while human participants used the spatial method of loci or the pegword method, a similarly associative but nonspatial mnemonic. The more effective spatial mnemonic induced a pronounced theta power decrease source localized to the left MTL compared with the nonspatial associative mnemonic strategy. This effect was mirrored by BOLD signal increases in the MTL. Successful encoding, irrespective of the strategy used, elicited decreases in left temporal theta power and increases in MTL BOLD activity. This pattern of results suggests a negative relationship between theta power and BOLD signal changes in the MTL during memory encoding and spatial processing. The findings extend the well known negative relation of alpha / beta oscillations and BOLD signals in the cortex to theta oscillations in the MTL.",
  "27447827": "Effect of Low - Dose MDCT and Iterative Reconstruction on Trabecular Bone Microstructure Assessment We investigated the effects of low - dose multi detector computed tomography (MDCT) in combination with statistical iterative reconstruction algorithms on trabecular bone microstructure parameters. Twelve donated vertebrae were scanned with the routine radiation exposure used in our department (standard-dose) and a low - dose protocol. Reconstructions were performed with filtered backprojection (FBP) and maximum-likelihood based statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR). Trabecular bone microstructure parameters were assessed and statistically compared for each reconstruction. Moreover, fracture loads of the vertebrae were biomechanically determined and correlated to the assessed microstructure parameters. Trabecular bone microstructure parameters based on low - dose MDCT and SIR significantly correlated with vertebral bone strength. There was no significant difference between microstructure parameters calculated on low - dose SIR and standard - dose FBP images. However, the results revealed a strong dependency on the regularization strength applied during SIR. It was observed that stronger regularization might corrupt the microstructure analysis, because the trabecular structure is a very small detail that might get lost during the regularization process. As a consequence, the introduction of SIR for trabecular bone microstructure analysis requires a specific optimization of the regularization parameters. Moreover, in comparison to other approaches, superior noise - resolution trade-offs can be found with the proposed methods.",
  "27485947": "Geometric morphometrics reveals restrictions on the shape of the female os coxae The methodology for sex determination in human skeletal remains depends on the different bone morphologies presented by men and women. Due to their direct implications in reproduction, the whole pelvis, particularly the os coxae, shows different characteristics in either sex. The sacrum and the os coxae constitute the birth cana l. In this research study, the os coxae shape is analyzed using geometric morphometrics, providing information on morphology, regardless of size or any other factor beyond the geometry itself. A total of 46 adult ossa coxae from a Spanish archaeological collection were studied using geometric morphometrics. The results show that there is a restriction on the shape of female os coxae. In contrast, male os coxae presents a greater range of variation. The biological reason for this difference is the obstetrical dilemma; a concept defined as the anatomical conflict between bipedalism and the full-term birth of a neonate whose large head requires greater dimensions in the pelvic cavity. Our experimental data reinforce the validity of the obstetrical dilemma as source of the restriction on the shape of female ossa coxae. Additionally, according to the results obtained, size itself does not represent a condition for belonging to one sex or another.",
  "28300431": "The Psychometric Costs of Applicants ' Faking: Examining Measurement Invariance and Retest Correlations Across Response Conditions This study examines the stability of the response process and the rank-order of respondents responding to 3 personality scales in 4 different response conditions. Applicants to the University College of Teacher Education Styria (N = 243) completed personality scales as part of their college admission process. Half a year later, they retook the same personality scales in 1 of 3 randomly assigned experimental response conditions: honest, faking-good, or reproduce. Longitudinal means and covariance structure analyses showed that applicants ' response processes could be partially reproduced after half a year, and respondents seemed to rely on an honest response behavior as a frame of reference. Additionally, applicants ' faking behavior and instructed faking (faking-good) caused differences in the latent retest correlations and consistently affected measurement properties. The varying latent retest correlations indicated that faking can distort respondents ' rank-order and thus the fairness of subsequent selection decisions, depending on the kind of faking behavior. Instructed faking (faking-good) even affected weak measurement invariance, whereas applicants ' faking behavior did not. Consequently, correlations with personality scales -which can be utilized for predictive validity -may be readily interpreted for applicants. Faking behavior also introduced a uniform bias, implying that the classically observed mean raw score differences may not be readily interpreted.",

Despite considerable achievements in the study of localized scleroderma, the etiology of the disease has not been investigated completely. Borrelia burgdorferi -the agent of Lyme disease -is suggested to be one of the possible etiological factors of localized scleroderma. However, among scientists, this hypothesis is quite controversial. We have conducted investigations of the level of IgM and IgG class antibodies to B. burgdorferi in the serum of patients with localized scleroderma. To rationally substantiate the role of B. burgdorferi in the occurrence of localized scleroderma, thirty-two patients with localized scleroderma treated at an in-patient department were examined. The level of anti-Borrelia antibodies was determined in ELISA. Diagnostic levels of IgM and/or IgG were detected in 18.8% of patients with localized scleroderma, which is more than in the population (p < 0.01). Positive levels of anti-Borrelia antibodies in patients with localized scleroderma confirm the borreliosis nature of the disease, requiring conduction of complex antimicrobial treatment.",
  "27727312": "Importance of Ecological Factors and Colony Handling for Optimizing Health Status of Apiaries in Mediterranean Ecosystems We analyzed six apiaries in several natural environments with a Mediterranean ecosystem in Madrid, central Spain, in order to understand how landscape and management characteristics may influence apiary health and bee production in the long term. We focused on five criteria (habitat quality, landscape heterogeneity, climate, management and health), as well as 30 subcriteria, and we used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to rank them according to relevance. Habitat quality proved to have the highest relevance, followed by beehive management. Within habitat quality, the following subcriteria proved to be most relevant: orographic diversity, elevation range and important plant species located 1.5 km from the apiary. The most important subcriteria under beehive management were honey production, movement of the apiary to a location with a higher altitude and wax renewal. Temperature was the most important subcriterion under climate, while pathogen and Varroa loads were the most significant under health. Two of the six apiaries showed the best values in the AHP analysis and showed annual honey production of 70 and 28 kg/ colony. This high productivity was due primarily to high elevation range and high orographic diversity, which favored high habitat quality. In addition, one of these apiaries showed the best value for beehive management, while the other showed the best value for health, reflected in the low pathogen load and low average number of viruses. These results highlight the importance of environmental factors and good sanitary practices to maximize apiary health and honey productivity.",

Residues from these environmental remediations are potential hazardous materials. Unfortunately, human health risks of BiOCls are still unexplored widely. In the present study, we focused on the influence of physicochemical properties on the cytotoxicity of BiOCls toward a human skin derived cell line (HaCaT). Results showed that morphology and surface hydroxyl both had a profound effect on the toxicity of BiOCls. Microsphere-shaped BiOCl caused less toxicity than nanosheet-shaped BiOCl because of weaker particle-membrane interactions, while the presence of surface hydroxyl on microsphere-shaped BiOCl significantly raised the toxicity owing to the increased interaction with cell membrane. Both microsphere-shaped BiOCl with surface hydroxyl and nanosheet-shaped BiOCl caused significant cell membrane damage (PI uptake and LDH release), however, based on the different mechanism. The former may be a predominant \"chemical\" mechanism involved an oxidative stress paradigm, as manifested by elevated ROS and depleted GSH, while the latter is mainly due to a direct \" physical \" damage to cell membrane. Both \" physical \" and \"chemical\" response led to cell death. Furthermore, a set of experiments including MMP collapse, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis / necrosis were conducted to propose a scenario for toxicological aspects of BiOCls. Data presented here would help to enable the rational design of BiOCls for either reducing their unintended consequences or increasing their application potentials.",
  "27773526": "An S116R Phosphorylation Site Mutation in Human Fibroblast Growth Factor-1 Differentially Affects Mitogenic and Glucose-Lowering Activities Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), a potent human mitogen and insulin sensitizer, signals through both tyrosine kinase receptor -mediated autocrine / paracrine pathways as well as a nuclear intracrine pathway. Phosphorylation of FGF-1 at serine 116 (S116) has been proposed to regulate intracrine signaling. Position S116 is located within a ∼17 amino acid C-terminal loop that contains a rich set of functional determinants including heparin ∖ heparan sulfate affinity, thiol reactivity, nuclear localization, pharmacokinetics, functional half-life, nuclear ligand affinity, stability, and structural dynamics. Mutational targeting of specific functionality in this region without perturbing other functional determinants is a design challenge. S116R is a non-phosphorylatable variant present in bovine FGF-1 and other members of the human FGF family. We show that the S116R mutation in human FGF-1 is accommodated with no perturbation of biophysical or structural properties, and is therefore an attractive mutation with which to elucidate the functional role of phosphorylation. Characterization of S116R shows reduction in NIH 3T3 fibroblast mitogenic stimulation, increase in fibroblast growth factor receptor-1c activation, and prolonged duration of glucose lowering in ob/ob hyperglycemic mice. A novel FGF-1 / fibroblast growth factor receptor-1c dimerization interaction combined with non-phosphorylatable intracrine signaling is hypothesized to be responsible for these observed functional effects.",

Our previous work demonstrates that oncogenic KIAA0101 transcript variant (tv) 1 promotes HCC development and might be a HCC therapeutic target. However, the function of another KIAA0101 variant, KIAA0101 tv2, remains unknown. In this study, we reported that KIAA0101 tv2 was highly expressed in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (NTs) compared to HCC tissues. In vivo and in vitro results showed that KIAA0101 tv2 decreased cell survival, colony formation, tumor xenografts, migration, and invasion, as well as induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, it could inhibit the function of KIAA0101 tv1 by partially down-regulating KIAA0101 tv1, acting similar to KIAA0101 tv1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Further studies illustrated that KIAA0101 tv2 could increase the activity of p53 by competing with KIAA0101 tv1 for P53 binding. In conclusion, KIAA0101 tv2 exerts anti-tumor activity in HCC and acts as an endogenous competitor of tumor-associated KIAA0101 tv1. KIAA0101 tv2 has a potential to work as a therapeutic drug targeting the KIAA0101 tv1 in HCC.",

Systematic review. A systematic search was performed, including citations from 1960 to May 2015. The review highlights methodological quality assessment of the selected studies; prevalence of pain; type, dose, and reason for opioid use; effectiveness of pain control and associated adverse effects of opioids in CKD patients. Twelve of 131 articles met inclusion criteria. There were no randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluable, and 12 were observational studies. Out of 12 studies, four were of high quality, six were of moderate quality, and the remaining two were low - quality studies. The studies were from different countries with sample size ranging from 10 to 12,782. Several studies showed a high prevalence of chronic uncontrolled pain. The effectiveness of different categories of opioids, dose, duration, and commonly prescribed opioids varied across studies. Based on a systematic review of the current literature, there is fair evidence for the high prevalence of chronic pain among patients with CKD, which is not being effectively managed, probably due to underprescription of analgesics or opioids in the CKD population. Clinicians are in need of additional and well-designed randomized control trials that focus on the indications for opioid therapy, appropriate opioid doses and dosing intervals, outcomes with adequacy of symptom control, and reporting on the incidence of adverse side effects.",

While many of these applications have been illustrated through in vitro and in vivo intracellular protein conjugation methods, extracellular self-assembly of protein conjugates offers unique advantages: simplifying purification, reducing toxicity and burden, and enabling tunability. Exploiting the recently described SpyTag-SpyCatcher system, we describe here how enzymes and structural proteins can be genetically encoded to covalently conjugate in culture media following programmable secretion from Bacillus subtilis. Using this approach, we demonstrate how self-conjugation of a secreted industrial enzyme, XynA, dramatically increases its resilience to boiling, and we show that cellular consortia can be engineered to self-assemble functional protein-protein conjugates with tunable composition. This novel genetically encoded modular system provides a flexible strategy for protein conjugation harnessing the substantial advantages of extracellular self-assembly.",

Normally, superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and H2O2 is then naturalized to be water by peroxiredoxin 4. We reported previously that recombinant protein transduction domain (PTD)- Cu/Zn SOD effectively scavenged excessive ROS and prevented cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-reoxygenation damage. However, whether PTD - Cu/Zn SOD would prevent BCP development is unknown. In the current study, we found that an implanted carcinoma in the rat tibia induced remarkable hyperalgesia, increased H2O2 levels and decreased SOD and peroxiredoxin 4 levels. After administration of recombinant PTD - Cu/Zn SOD to these tumor-burden rats, their hyperalgesia was significantly attenuated and peroxiredoxin 4 expression was significantly increased. In addition, an increased expression of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and a decreased expression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in this cancer pain were prevented by PTD - Cu/Zn SOD administration or peroxiredoxin 4 overexpression. Our data suggested that reactive oxygen species, at least in part, play a role in cancer metastatic pain development and persistency which can be attenuated by the adminstration of recombinant PTD - Cu/Zn SOD via the peroxiredoxin 4 modulation from oxidative stress.",
  "27392380": "Energy Expenditure and Intensity of Classroom Physical Activity in Elementary School Children There is limited data regarding objectively measured energy cost and intensity of classroom instruction. Therefore, the purpose of current study was to objectively measure energy cost and subsequently calculate MET values using a portable indirect calorimeter (IC) for both normal classroom instruction (NCI) and active classroom instruction (ACI). We assessed energy expenditure (EE) and intensity levels (METs) in elementary school children (17 boys and 15 girls) using an IC (COSMED K4b2). Independent t-tests were used to evaluate potential sex and grade level differences for age, BMI, VO2, EE, and METs. The average EE for NCI and ACI were 1.8 ± 0.4 and 3.9 ± 1.0, respectively. The average intensity level for NCI and ACI were 1.9 ± 0.4 and 4.2 ± 0.9 METs, respectively. PA delivered through ACI can elicit EE at a moderate intensity level. These results provide evidence for ACI as a convenient/feasible avenue for increasing PA in youth without decreasing instruction time.",
  "27354236": "Novel insights into development of diabetic bladder disorder provided by metabolomic analysis of the rat nondiabetic and diabetic detrusor and urothelial layer There are at present no published studies providing a global overview of changes in bladder metabolism resulting from diabetes. Such studies have the potential to provide mechanistic insight into the development of diabetic bladder disorder (DBD). In the present study, we compared the metabolome of detrusor and urothelial layer in a 1-mo streptozotocin -induced rat model of type 1 diabetes with nondiabetic controls. Our studies revealed that diabetes caused both common and differential changes in the detrusor and urothelial layer's metabolome. Diabetes resulted in similar changes in the levels of previously described diabetic markers in both tissues, such as glucose, lactate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, branched-chain amino acid degradation products, bile acids, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol, as well as markers of oxidative stress. In the detrusor (but not the urothelial layer), diabetes caused activation of the pentose-phosphate and polyol pathways, concomitant with a reduction in the TCA cycle and β-oxidation. Changes in detrusor energy-generating pathways resulted in an accumulation of sorbitol that, through generation of advanced glycation end products, is likely to play a central role in the development of DBD. In the diabetic urothelial layer there was decreased flux of glucose via glycolysis and changes in lipid metabolism, particularly prostaglandin synthesis, which also potentially contributes to detrusor dysfunction.",
  "28033500": "Autonomous assembly of ordered metastable DNA nanoarchitecture and in situ visualizing of intracellular microRNAs Facile assembly of intelligent DNA nanoobjects with the ability to exert in situ visualization of intracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) has long been concerned in the fields of DNA nanotechnology and basic medical study. Here, we present a driving primer (DP)-triggered polymerization -mediated metastable assembly (PMA) strategy to prepare a well-ordered metastable DNA nanoarchitecture composed of only two hairpin probes (HAPs), which has never been explored by assembly methods. Its structural features and functions are characterized by atomic force microscope (AFM) and gel electrophoresis. Even if with a metastable molecular structure, this nanoarchitecture is relatively stable at physiological temperature. The assembly strategy can be expanded to execute microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) in situ imaging inside cancer cells by labelling one of the HAPs with fluorophore and quencher. Compared with the conventional fluorescence probe -based in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, confocal images revealed that the proposed DNA nanoassembly can not only achieve greatly enhanced imaging effect within cancer cells, but also reflect the miRNA-21 expression level sensitively. We believe that the easily constructed DNA nanoarchitecture and in situ profiling strategy are significant progresses in DNA assembly and molecule imaging in cells.",

It generally occurs in children, and is not known to be associated with systemic disease. The authors report histopathological and clinical findings in 14 cases of subepidermal calcified nodule of the eyelid, including 3 older patients with unique microscopic features. Clinical records and pathological materials were critically reviewed in each case, including von kossa, CD3, CD20, and CD68 stains. The 14 cases presented clinically as nodular eyelid lesions. All were treated with surgical excision. The authors found 2 distinct histopathological patterns which correlated with the patients ' age. In young patients, the authors observed multiple, small calcified bodies within the dermis surrounded by chronic inflammation and granulomatous foreign body reaction. On the other hand, in elderly patients, lesions were characterized by a single, large, well-demarcated amorphous calcified deposit surrounded by fibrous tissue, without chronic inflammation or foreign body reaction. One of these patients, a 70- year-old man, also suffered from gout. The presence of subepidermal calcified nodule was not documented as a preoperative diagnostic possibility in any of the cases. Subepidermal calcified nodule of the eyelid is a rare condition, but should be considered in any patient presenting with a painless white to yellowish colored nodule of the ocular adnexa, particularly during the teenage years. Clinicians and pathologists should be aware that this entity has a distinct appearance and could be associated with systemic conditions in elderly patients.",

  "28541529": "Statistical algorithms improve accuracy of gene fusion detection Gene fusions are known to play critical roles in tumor pathogenesis. Yet, sensitive and specific algorithms to detect gene fusions in cancer do not currently exist. In this paper, we present a new statistical algorithm, MACHETE (Mismatched Alignment CHimEra Tracking Engine), which achieves highly sensitive and specific detection of gene fusions from RNA-Seq data, including the highest Positive Predictive Value (PPV) compared to the current state-of-the-art, as assessed in simulated data. We show that the best performing published algorithms either find large numbers of fusions in negative control data or suffer from low sensitivity detecting known driving fusions in gold standard settings, such as EWSR1-FLI1. As proof of principle that MACHETE discovers novel gene fusions with high accuracy in vivo, we mined public data to discover and subsequently PCR validate novel gene fusions missed by other algorithms in the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3. These results highlight the gains in accuracy achieved by introducing statistical models into fusion detection, and pave the way for unbiased discovery of potentially driving and druggable gene fusions in primary tumors.",

Patients with BNP ≥200 pg/mL (High - BNP, n=170) had more advanced HF characteristics, including lower EF (25.0±8.6% vs. 28.1±8.0%, P=0.0008), than those with BNP <200 pg/mL. In the High - BNP patients, peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2) was significantly increased by 8.3±16.2% during the ET program, and changes in peak V̇O2 inversely correlated with changes in BNP (R=-0.453, P<0.0001) and changes in ventilatory efficiency (V̇E / V̇CO2 slope) (R=-0.439, P<0.0001). During a median follow-up of 46 months, patients in the upper tertile of changes in peak V̇O2 (≥13.0%), compared with those in the lower tertile (<1.0%), had lower rates of the composite of all-cause death or HF hospitalization (37.9% vs. 54.4%, P=0.036) and all-cause death (8.6% vs. 24.6%, P=0.056). In the multivariate analysis, change in peak V̇O2 was a significant independent predictor of the composite outcome and all-cause death.

Retrospective cohort study. Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana (Pisa University Hospital). Patients residing in the territory of the province of Pisa (Tuscany Region) with at least one unplanned hospital admission leading to a medical Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) in the calendar year 2012. We compared two groups of patients: patients coded as 'RA30' (readmitted within 30 days after the previous discharge) and patients coded as 'NRA30' (either admitted only once or readmitted after 30 days since the latest discharge). The effect of age, sex, length of stay, number of diagnoses, normalized number of admissions and presence of diseases on the probability of rehospitalization within 30 days after discharge was evaluated. The significant variables included in the predictive model were: age, odds ratio (OR) = 1.018, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.011-1.026; normalized number of admissions, OR = 1.257, CI = 1.225-1.290; number of diagnoses, OR = 1.306, CI = 1.174-1.452 and presence of cancer diagnosis, OR = 1.479, CI = 1.088-2.011. The model can be easily applied when discharging patients who have been hospitalized after an access to the Emergency Department to predict the risk of rehospitalization within 30 days. The prediction can be used to activate focused hospital-primary care transitional interventions. The model has to be validated first in order to be implemented in clinical practice.",

Patients entering the cohort within one year of diagnosis constitute the inception cohort. Patients with late-onset (age at diagnosis ≥50) disease were identified and matched 1:2 based on gender and first clinic visit (±5) years with patients with early-onset disease (age at diagnosis 18-40 years). Results A total of 86 patients with late-onset disease (84.9% female, 81.4% Caucasian, mean age at SLE diagnosis ± SD 58.05 ± 7.30) and 169 patients with early-onset disease (86.4% female, 71% Caucasian, mean age at SLE diagnosis ± SD 27.80 ± 5.90) were identified. At enrollment, late-onset SLE patients had a lower total number of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, with less renal and neurologic manifestations. Mean SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) scores were lower in late-onset SLE, especially renal features and anti-dsDNA positivity. Over 5 years, mean SLEDAI-2K scores decreased in both groups, while mean Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR Damage Index (SDI) scores increased more significantly in the late-onset group; they developed more cardiovascular, renal, and ocular damage, and had higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusion Although the late-onset SLE group had a milder presentation and less active disease, with the evolution of disease, they developed more organ damage likely as a consequence of cardiovascular risk factors and aging.",

Women with transvaginal cerclage placement and a prior delivery between 16 and 36 weeks of gestation were identified over a 10- year period (July 2002 to May 2012) in this retrospective cohort study. Exclusion criteria were delivery at another institution, abdominal cerclage, multiple gestations, and major fetal anomalies. Maternal demographics, gestational age at cerclage, gestational age at delivery, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM), and birth weight were compared between women with a cerclage and cerclage plus 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate. The primary outcome was delivery at less than 24 weeks of gestation. Of the 411 women who had a cerclage, 260 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 171 received a cerclage alone and 89 received cerclage plus 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate. The two groups were not different with respect to maternal demographics and gestational age at cerclage. There was a significant difference among those who received indomethacin at the time of cerclage, betamethasone administration, and history of a loop electrosurgical excision procedure - cold knife cone and cerclage. Delivery at less than 24 weeks of gestation occurred in 6% of women receiving both 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and cerclage compared with 16% in the cerclage only group (odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.78, P=.01). In the multivariate analysis controlling for indomethacin use, prior cerclage, and loop electrosurgical excision procedure - cold knife cone there was a 73% reduction in delivery in the combined treatment group compared with cerclage alone (adjusted OR 0.26, P=.02). A multivariant analysis was conducted with correction for indomethacin at the time of cerclage, prior cerclage, and loop electrosurgical excision procedure - cold knife cone and cerclage surgery. Even after controlling for significant variables, there remained a 73% reduction in delivery at less than 24 weeks of gestation in the cerclage plus 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate cohort (adjusted OR 0.26, P=.02). Women receiving transvaginal cerclage plus 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate had a 69% relative reduction in delivery at less than 24 weeks of gestation when compared with women receiving cerclage alone. We found no difference in overall preterm delivery or preterm PROM. In this cohort, compared with cerclage alone, the likelihood of a viable neonate improves with both treatments.",
  "27689542": "Safe Routes to Play? Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crashes Near Parks in Los Angeles Areas near parks may present active travelers with higher risks than in other areas due to the confluence of more pedestrians and bicyclists, younger travelers, and the potential for increased traffic volumes. These risks may be amplified in low-income and minority neighborhoods due to generally higher rates of active travel or lack of safety infrastructure. This paper examines active travel crashes near parks and builds on existing research around disparities in park access and extends research from the Safe Routes to School and Safe Routes to Transit movements to parks. We utilized the Green Visions Parks coverage, encompassing Los Angeles County and several other cities in the LA Metropolitan area. We used negative bionomial regression modeling techniques and ten years of geolocated pedestrian and bicyclist crash data to assess the number of active travel injuries within a quarter mile (~400m) buffer around parks. We controlled for differential exposures to active travel using travel survey data and Bayesian smoothing models. Of 1,311,736 parties involved in 608,530 crashes, there were 896,359 injuries and 7317 fatalities. The number of active travel crash injuries is higher within a quarter-mile of a park, with a ratio of 1.52 per 100,000 residents, compared to areas outside that buffer. This higher rate near parks is amplified in neighborhoods with high proportions of minority and low-income residents. Higher traffic levels are highly predictive of active travel crash injuries. Planners should consider the higher risks of active travel near parks and the socioeconomic modification of these risks. Additional traffic calming and safety infrastructure may be needed to provide safe routes to parks.",
  "27371349": "A Cyclin D2 -derived peptide acts on specific cell cycle phases by activating ERK1/2 to cause the death of breast cancer cells Protein degradation by the proteasome generates functional intracellular peptides. Pep5, a peptide derived from Cyclin D2, induces cell death in tumor cell lines and reduces the volume of rat C6 glioblastoma tumors in vivo. Here, we chose the human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to evaluate the mechanism of cell death induced by pep5 in different phases of the cell cycle. Fluorescently labeled pep5, monitored by real time confocal microscopy, entered the MDA-MB-231 cells 3min after application and localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm. Pep5 - induced cell death was increased when the MDA-MB-231 cell population was arrested at the G1/S transition or in S phase compared to asynchronous cells. Pep5 induced permanent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells synchronized in G1/S or S phase. Affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry identified CLIC1 and Plectin as the only two proteins that interacted with pep5 in both asynchronous and synchronized MDA-MB-231 cells. These interactions could explain the long-lasting ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the cytoskeleton perturbations in the MDA-MB-231 cells, in which the stress fibers ' integrity is affected by pep5 treatments. These data suggest that pep5 has potential therapeutic properties for treating specific types of cancers, such as breast cancer cells. Pep5, a natural intracellular peptide formed by the degradation of Cyclin D2 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, induces cell death when reintroduced into MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which express low levels of Cyclin D2, specifically in G1/S arrested cells or in cells that are passing through S phase. Under these conditions, pep5 is able to interact with different intracellular proteins, primarily cytoskeleton and proteasome components, which can lead to cellular apoptosis. Together, our data suggest that pep5 is an intracellular peptide with therapeutic potential for treating specific types of tumors with low expression of Cyclin D2 by inhibiting cell proliferation.",

Herein, we uncover that a photosensitizer, chlorin e6 (Ce6), could be decorated into the membrane of RBCs upon simple mixing, without affecting the membrane integrity and stability in dark. Upon light irradiation with a rather low power density, the generated singlet oxygen by Ce6 as the result of photodynamic effect would lead to rather efficient disruption of RBC membrane. With doxorubicin (DOX), a typical chemotherapy drug, as the model, we engineer a unique type of light-responsive RBC-based DDS by decorating Ce6 on the cell membrane and loading DOX inside cells. The light triggered cell membrane break down would thus trigger instant release of DOX, enabling light-controlled chemotherapy with great specificity. Beyond that, our RBC system could also be utilized for loading of larger biomolecules such as enzymes, whose release as well as catalytic function is also controlled by light. Our work thus presents a unique type of biocompatible cell-based DDS that can be precisely controlled by mild external stimuli, promising not only for cancer therapy but also for other potential applications in biotechnologies.",
  "28028852": "Structural investigation on WlaRG from Campylobacter jejuni: A sugar aminotransferase Campylobacter jejuni is a Gram-negative bacterium that represents a leading cause of human gastroenteritis worldwide. Of particular concern is the link between C. jejuni infections and the subsequent development of Guillain-Barré syndrome, an acquired autoimmune disorder leading to paralysis. All Gram-negative bacteria contain complex glycoconjugates anchored to their outer membranes, but in most strains of C. jejuni, this lipoglycan lacks the O-antigen repeating units. Recent mass spectrometry analyses indicate that the C. jejuni 81116 (Penner serotype HS:6) lipoglycan contains two dideoxyhexosamine residues, and enzymological assay data show that this bacterial strain can synthesize both dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-glucose and dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose. The focus of this investigation is on WlaRG from C. jejuni, which plays a key role in the production of these unusual sugars by functioning as a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent aminotransferase. Here, we describe the first three-dimensional structures of the enzyme in various complexes determined to resolutions of 1.7 Å or higher. Of particular significance are the external aldimine structures of WlaRG solved in the presence of either dTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose or dTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-d-glucose.

  "28009695": "Elastin Is Differentially Regulated by Pressure Therapy in a Porcine Model of Hypertrophic Scar Beneficial effects of pressure therapy for hypertrophic scars have been reported, but the mechanisms of action are not fully understood. This study evaluated elastin and its contribution to scar pliability. The relationship between changes in Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) scores of pressure-treated scars and differential regulation of elastin was assessed. Hypertrophic scars were created and assessed weekly using VSS and biopsy procurement. Pressure treatment began on day 70 postinjury. Treated scars were compared with untreated shams. Treatment lasted 2 weeks, through day 84, and scars were assessed weekly through day 126. Transcript and protein levels of elastin were quantified. Pressure treatment resulted in lower VSS scores compared with sham-treated scars. Pliability (VSSP) was a key contributor to this difference. At day 70 pretreatment, VSSP = 2. Without treatment, sham-treated scars became less pliable, while pressure-treated scars became more pliable. The percentage of elastin in scars at day 70 was higher than in uninjured skin. Following treatment, the percentage of elastin increased and continued to increase through day 126. Untreated sham scars did not show a similar increase. Quantification of Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining corroborated the findings and immunofluorescence revealed the alignment of elastin fibers. Pressure treatment results in increased protein level expression of elastin compared with sham -untreated scars. These findings further characterize the extracellular matrix's response to the application of pressure as a scar treatment, which will contribute to the refinement of rehabilitation practices and ultimately improvements in functional and psychosocial outcomes for patients.",

Subgroup analyses revealed that HLA-DRB1*14 and DQB1*02 alleles were more frequent in early-onset MG [n = 10 (20.8%) vs. n = 25 (10.0%) and n = 21 (43.8%) vs. n = 59 (23.6%)]. In patients seropositive for anti-AchR antibodies, the frequencies of HLA-B*50 and C*05 were higher. HLA-C*05, DRB1*01, and DRB1*11 were higher in patients with ocular MG. In addition, HLA-A*01, A*31, B*08, and DRB1*14 were higher among patients with thymic hyperplasia, whereas DQB1*03 was lower. However, all of these differences lost significance after correction of the p value for multiple comparisons. No allele association was found among patients with thymoma. Strikingly, patients with generalized MG who had pure ocular symptoms at disease onset had significantly increased HLA-B*50 compared to the controls (corrected p < 0.001, OR = 9.92; 95% CI 3.05-32.22). The HLA-B*50 allele was associated with conversion to generalized disease in patients with pure ocular symptoms at disease onset. This finding could extend our understanding of the complex interactions between the pathogenesis of MG and genetic heritage.",
  "28480148": "The use of informativity in the development of robust viromics -based examinations Metagenomics -based studies have provided insight into many of the complex microbial communities responsible for maintaining life on this planet. Sequencing efforts often uncover novel genetic content; this is most evident for phage communities, in which upwards of 90% of all sequences exhibit no similarity to any sequence in current data repositories. For the small fraction that can be identified, the top BLAST hit is generally posited as being representative of a viral taxon present in the sample of origin. Homology -based classification, however, can be misleading as sequence repositories capture but a small fraction of phage diversity. Furthermore, lateral gene transfer is pervasive within phage communities. As such, the presence of a particular gene may not be indicative of the presence of a particular viral species. Rather, it is just that: an indication of the presence of a specific gene. To circumvent this limitation, we have developed a new method for the analysis of viral metagenomic datasets. BLAST hits are weighted, integrating the sequence identity and length of alignments as well as a taxonomic signal, such that each gene is evaluated with respect to its information content. Through this quantifiable metric, predictions of viral community structure can be made with confidence. As a proof-of-concept, the approach presented here was implemented and applied to seven freshwater viral metagenomes. While providing a robust method for evaluating viral metagenomic data, the tool is versatile and can easily be customized to investigations of any environment or biome.",
  "27683502": "Harmonization of Clinical Laboratory Information - Current and Future Strategies According to a patient -centered viewpoint, the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made. Harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information. Although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods, the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process (TTP), such as terminology and units, report formats, reference intervals and decision limits, as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation. Two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine: first, the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the TTP, thus dealing with the request, the sample, the measurement, and the report. Second, as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated, a systematic approach is needed. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays, and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders.",

In Exp. 1, 54 barrows (initial age = 28 d) were fed a common diet for 7 d and then fed their allotted dietary treatment (either 100% basal diet or 1 of 5 test diets consisting of 90% basal diet plus 10% test lipid) for the next 7 d in group pens (9 pigs / pen). For the next 10 d, pigs were moved to individual metabolism crates for continued diet and crate adaptation and to a twice-daily feeding regimen. Pigs remained on their respective diets for a 4-d total fecal and urine collection period. For Exp. 2, 567 male broilers were obtained from a commercial hatchery (1 d of age) and reared in grower battery cages that contained 9 chicks per cage. Broilers were fed a common corn - soybean meal starter diet from placement until the beginning of the trial (19 d of age). Birds were then randomly assigned to 1 of 6 dietary treatments (94% basal diet plus 6% dextrose or 94% basal diet plus 6% test lipid substituted for dextrose) on d 19 and were allowed an 8-d dietary acclimation period followed by a 48-h energy balance assay. In Exp. 1, the DCO sample with 12.8% FFA contained the lowest (< 0.05) DE (8,036 kcal/kg) content compared with the 0.04% refined CO sample and the 4.9 or 93.8% FFA DCO samples (8,814, 8,828, and 8,921 kcal/kg, respectively), with the DCO source containing 13.9% FFA having intermediate DE (8,465 kcal/kg) content. The ME content of these lipid sources also differed among treatments (< 0.01), following trends similar to their DE values, with no differences noted for ME as a percentage of DE (> 0.35) content among the lipids evaluated. In Exp. 2, lipids containing 0.04, 4.9, 12.8, and 13.9% FFA had similar nitrogen corrected apparent ME (AME) values (8,072, 7,936, 8,036, and 7,694 respectively), except for the industrially hydrolyzed DCO sample containing 93.8% FFA, which contained 6,276 kcal/kg (< 0.01). Using published prediction equations, the predicted DE of these lipids for swine was 3.5% greater than the values determined in Exp. 1 for all lipid sources, except for the DCO sample containing 93.8% FFA, which the predicted DE was underestimated. Likewise, the predicted AME of these lipids for broilers was 7.4% greater than the determined AMEn (Exp. 2) for all lipid sources.",

Here we show that the small neurotoxin is not as specific as anticipated. It is also a high-affinity inhibitor with an IC50 of 13 nM of the Kv1.3 channel; it blocks the latter with potency similar to the Kv1.3 blocker PAP-1. Since SK type channels and Kv1.3 channels are frequently coexpressed in different tissues such as cells of the immune system, apamin must be used with caution as a pharmacological tool.",
  "27692888": "Effective degradation of methylisothiazolone biocide using ozone: Kinetics, mechanisms, and decreases in toxicity Methylisothiazolone (MIT) is a common biocide that is widely used in water-desalination reverse-osmosis processes. The transformation of MIT during water treatment processes is poorly understood. The kinetics and mechanisms involved in the degradation of MIT during ozonation were investigated in this study. Ozonation was found to be a useful way of degrading MIT in water, and the degradation rate constant was 0.11 (±0.1) × 10(3) L/(mol·s). The degradation rate constant did not change when the pH was increased from 3 to 9. The pre-exponential factor A and the activation energy Ea for the ozonation process were 7.564 × 10(13) L/(mol·s) and 66.74 kJ/mol, respectively. The decrease in the MIT concentration and the amount of ozone consumed were measured, and the stoichiometric factor α for the ozone consumption to MIT removal ratio was found to be 1.8. Several ozonation products were detected using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Almost 32% of the organic sulfur in the MIT was oxidized to release sulfate ions, which caused a decrease in pH. Sulfur atoms were oxidized to sulfone species and then h ydrolyzed to give sulfate during ozonation. Addition reactions involving carbon-carbon double bonds and the oxidation of α-carbon atoms also occurred. MIT was found to be lethal to Daphnia magna Straus (D. magna) with a median lethal concentration of 18.2 μmol/L. Even though the primary ozonation products of MIT still showed some toxicity to D. magna, ozone could minimize the toxic effect after a long reaction time.",
  "28396298": "TGF-β1 functional polymorphisms: a review Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a role in several biological processes. TGF-β1 is the most abundantly expressed isoform, associated with susceptibility to various diseases, and several polymorphisms have been described in the TGF-β1 gene structure, and some of them have been associated with functional implications. To date, eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one deletion / insertion polymorphism have been shown to affect TGF-β1 expression (rs2317130, rs11466313, rs1800468, rs1800469, rs11466314, rs1800471, rs1800470, and rs11466316); some of these interfere with transcriptional regulation by affecting the binding of transcription factors binding, while others interfere with protein production. These polymorphisms have been associated with different types of diseases (i.e., cancers, cardiac diseases, inflammatory diseases, and others) and could therefore be used as susceptibility biomarkers. Since polymorphism clusters are likely to be more reliable than single polymorphisms in this respect, it is hoped that haplotype analysis of TGF-β1 may reveal the genetic basis of disease susceptibility associated with the TGF-β1 gene.",
  "27935268": "Characterization of Contributing Factors to Variability in Morphine Clearance Through PBPK Modeling Implemented With OCT1 Transporter Morphine shows large interindividual variability in its pharmacokinetics; however, the cause of this has not been fully addressed. The variability in morphine disposition is considered to be due to a combination of pharmacogenetic and physiological determinants related to morphine disposition. We previously reported the effect of organic cation transporter (OCT1) genotype on morphine disposition in pediatric patients. To further explore the underlying mechanisms for variability arising from relevant determinants, including OCT1, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of morphine was developed. The PBPK model predicted morphine concentration-time profiles well, in both adults and children. Almost all of the observed morphine clearances in pediatric patients fell within a twofold range of median predicted values for each OCT1 genotype in each age group. This PBPK modeling approach quantitatively demonstrates that OCT1 genotype, age-related growth, and changes in blood flow as important contributors to morphine pharmacokinetic (PK) variability.",
  "28444830": "Gene expression reveals evidence for EGFR -dependent proximal-distal limb patterning in a myriapod Evolution of segmented limbs is one of the key innovations of Arthropoda, allowing development of functionally specific specialized head and trunk appendages, a major factor behind their unmatched evolutionary success. Proximodistal limb patterning is controlled by two regulatory networks in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, and other insects. The first is represented by the function of the morphogens Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp); the second by the EGFR-signaling cascade. While the role of Wg and Dpp has been studied in a wide range of arthropods representing all main branches, that is, Pancrustacea (= Hexapoda + Crustacea), Myriapoda and Chelicerata, investigation of the potential role of EGFR-signaling is restricted to insects (Hexapoda). Gene expression analysis of Egfr, its potential ligands, and putative downstream factors in the pill millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda: Diplopoda), reveals that-in at least mandibulate arthropods - EGFR-signaling is likely a conserved regulatory mechanism in proximodistal limb patterning.",
  "28315039": "Ecology and Feeding Habits Drive Infection of Water Bugs with Mycobacterium ulcerans Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, is present in a wide spectrum of environments, including terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in tropical regions. The most promising studies on the epidemiological risk of this disease suggest that some ecological settings may favor infection of animals with MU including human. A species ' needs and impacts on resources and the environment, i.e., its ecological niche, may influence its susceptibility to be infected by this microbial form. For example, some Naucoridae may dive in fresh waters to prey upon infected animals and thus may get infected with MU. However, these studies have rarely considered that inference on the ecological settings favoring infection and transmission may be confounded because host carrier sister species have similar ecological niches, and potentially the same host - microbe interactions. Hence, a relationship between the ecological niche of Naucoridae and its infection with MU may be due to a symbiotic relationship between the host and the pathogen, rather than its ecological niche. To account for this confounding effect, we investigated the relationships between surrogates of the ecological niche of water bug species and their susceptibility to MU, by performing phylogenetic comparative analyses on a large dataset of 11 families of water bugs collected in 10 different sites across Cameroon, central Africa. Our results indicate that MU circulates and infects a couple of host taxa, i.e., Belostomatidae, Naucoridae, living both in the aquatic vegetation and as predators inside the trophic network and sister species of water bugs have indeed similar host - microbe interactions with MU.",

We conducted this case control study during November 2009 to December 2012. Children were classified as case if length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) was <-2 and as control if LAZ was >-1 SD. The logistic regression model was used to find the factors associated with stunting. The significant risk factors for stunting were: child's age >12 months, maternal undernutrition, mother's education <5 years, consumption of untreated drinking water and monthly family income <100 USD. The findings of this study reiterated the role of maternal undernutrition and less education, consumption of untreated drinking water and poor family income as important associated factors of childhood stunting in resource-poor setting.",

  "28416969": "Repeatability and agreement of ultrasonography with computed tomography for evaluating forefoot structure in the coronal plane Forefoot structure is important to understand some foot problems such as hallux valgus and metatarsalgia. Ultrasonography (US) is a highly portable, noninvasive, low cost, and fast imaging method, especially when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and radiography. As the use of US for evaluating forefoot bony structure has not been validated, except for the presence of synovitis, erosions and bursitis within the forefoot in people with inflammatory arthritis, the purpose of this study was to determine whether US is a reliable method for evaluating forefoot structure. Sixty feet (30 women, age = 40.1 ± 11.8 years) were examined by US and CT to assess agreement with CT and repeatability of US evaluation of the 2nd metatarsal head height, length between the medial sesamoid bone and 5th metatarsal head, transverse arch height, transverse arch index, sesamoid rotation angle, and area under the transverse arch. The measurement data were evaluated for agreement with CT using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)3, 1, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plot, and with ICC1, 1 for repeatability. The ICC3, 1 values of 0.78-0.89, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78-0.90, and Bland-Altman plots showed almost perfect agreements between the US and CT method for all parameters, except the area under the transverse arch (AUTA). The ICC1, 1 also showed perfect agreements (0.84-0.92) between two sets of US measurements in all parameters. The US evaluation of forefoot structure in the coronal plane showed good agreement with CT and repeatability of two ultrasonograms in adult women. This reliable evaluation method of forefoot structure can contribute to a quick clinical assessment screening for risk factors of foot problems such as hallux valgus and metatarsalgia. However, because of some limitations such as a lack of inter-observer reliability, more research is needed to validate US evaluation of forefoot structure. The current study (trial registration number: R0297) was approved by the Ethical Committee for Human Experiments of Kyoto University (http://www.ec.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp) on December 3, 2015.

  "27486419": "Can We Predict Burnout among Student Nurses? An Exploration of the ICWR-1 Model of Individual Psychological Resilience The nature of nursing work is demanding and can be stressful. Previous studies have shown a high rate of burnout among employed nurses. Recently, efforts have been made to understand the role of resilience in determining the psychological adjustment of employed nurses. A theoretical model of resilience was proposed recently that includes several constructs identified in the literature related to resilience and to psychological functioning. As nursing students are the future of the nursing workforce it is important to advance our understanding of the determinants of resilience in this population. Student nurses who had completed their final practicum were invited to participate in an online survey measuring the key constructs of the ICWR-1 model. 422 students from across Australia and Canada completed the survey between July 2014 and July 2015. As well as several key demographics, trait negative affect, mindfulness, self-efficacy, coping, resilience, and burnout were measured. We used structural equation modeling and found support for the major pathways of the model; namely that resilience had a significant influence on the relationship between mindfulness, self-efficacy and coping, and psychological adjustment (burnout scores). Furthermore, as predicted, Neuroticism moderated the relationship between coping and burnout. Results are discussed in terms of potential approaches to supporting nursing students who may be at risk of burnout.",
  "27916672": "Famous faces and voices: Differential profiles in early right and left semantic dementia and in Alzheimer's disease Famous face and voice recognition is reported to be impaired both in semantic dementia (SD) and in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), although more severely in the former. In AD a coexistence of perceptual impairment in face and voice processing has also been reported and this could contribute to the altered performance in complex semantic tasks. On the other hand, in SD both face and voice recognition disorders could be related to the prevalence of atrophy in the right temporal lobe (RTL). The aim of the present study was twofold: (1) to investigate famous faces and voices recognition in SD and AD to verify if the two diseases show a differential pattern of impairment, resulting from disruption of different cognitive mechanisms; (2) to check if face and voice recognition disorders prevail in patients with atrophy mainly affecting the RTL. To avoid the potential influence of primary perceptual problems in face and voice recognition, a pool of patients suffering from early SD and AD were administered a detailed set of tests exploring face and voice perception. Thirteen SD (8 with prevalence of right and 5 with prevalence of left temporal atrophy) and 25 CE patients, who did not show visual and auditory perceptual impairment, were finally selected and were administered an experimental battery exploring famous face and voice recognition and naming. Twelve SD patients underwent cerebral PET imaging and were classified in right and left SD according to the onset modality and to the prevalent decrease in FDG uptake in right or left temporal lobe respectively. Correlation of PET imaging and famous face and voice recognition was performed. Results showed a differential performance profile in the two diseases, because AD patients were significantly impaired in the naming tests, but showed preserved recognition, whereas SD patients were profoundly impaired both in naming and in recognition of famous faces and voices. Furthermore, face and voice recognition disorders prevailed in SD patients with RTL atrophy, who also showed a conceptual impairment on the Pyramids and Palm Trees test more important in the pictorial than in the verbal modality. Finally, in 12 SD patients in whom PET was available, a strong correlation between FDG uptake and face-to-name and voice-to-name matching data was found in the right but not in the left temporal lobe. The data support the hypothesis of a different cognitive basis for impairment of face and voice recognition in the two dementias and suggest that the pattern of impairment in SD may be due to a loss of semantic representations, while a defect of semantic control, with impaired naming and preserved recognition might be hypothesized in AD. Furthermore, the correlation between face and voice recognition disorders and RTL damage are consistent with the hypothesis assuming that in the RTL person -specific knowledge may be mainly based upon non-verbal representations.",
  "28278150": "Integrating molecular QTL data into genome-wide genetic association analysis: Probabilistic assessment of enrichment and colocalization We propose a novel statistical framework for integrating the result from molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping into genome-wide genetic association analysis of complex traits, with the primary objectives of quantitatively assessing the enrichment of the molecular QTLs in complex trait - associated genetic variants and the colocalizations of the two types of association signals. We introduce a natural Bayesian hierarchical model that treats the latent association status of molecular QTLs as SNP - level annotations for candidate SNPs of complex traits. We detail a computational procedure to seamlessly perform enrichment, fine-mapping and colocalization analyses, which is a distinct feature compared to the existing colocalization analysis procedures in the literature. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and requires only summary - level statistics. We evaluate and demonstrate the proposed computational approach through extensive simulation studies and analyses of blood lipid data and the whole blood eQTL data from the GTEx project. In addition, a useful utility from our proposed method enables the computation of expected colocalization signals using simple characteristics of the association data. Using this utility, we further illustrate the importance of enrichment analysis on the ability to discover colocalized signals and the potential limitations of currently available molecular QTL data. The software pipeline that implements the proposed computation procedures, enloc, is freely available at https://github.com/xqwen/integrative.",

In addition, there was an observational evaluation of hematological response to oral iron. A population-based retrospective study including 90 Swedish children (median 13 years) with IBD was performed. Patient records covered in median 25 months. Iron deficiency was present in 70/77 children (91%) in which iron status could be assessed. In clinical and biochemical remission, iron deficiency was found in 57/67 (85%) of children, and 23 (34%) of them had iron deficiency anemia. Thirty-six iron-deficient children were prescribed oral iron supplementation and 32 (89%) improved hemoglobin levels over 6 months. In conclusion, iron deficiency is common during clinical remission in children with IBD, even in cohorts with low prevalence of anemia. Therefore, regular biochemical screening for iron deficiency is warranted during all stages of disease, irrespective of symptoms and inflammatory blood markers.",

A total of 414 hyperuricemia patients and 406 gender and age -matched normouricemic controls were enrolled. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped as genetic markers for the human HNF4G gene (rs2977939, rs1805098, rs2941484, rs4735692). Data were analyzed for two separate groups: men and women. For rs2941484, the genotype distribution frequency in hyperuricemic subjects and was significantly different from that in normouricemic controls in men (P = 0.038). Meanwhile, in recessive model of rs2941484, the distribution frequency of TT genotype and CC+CT genotypes also differed significantly between the hyperuricemia men and normouricemic men (P = 0.011). For the other 3 SNPs in both men and women, there was no difference in the genotype and allele and distribution frequency between the hyperuricemia patients and normouricemic controls. In men, after adjustments for BMI, SBP, DBP, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and creatinine, the men with the TT genotype of rs2941484 were found to have significantly higher probability of suffering from hyperuricemia than the ones with CT and CC genotypes (OR = 2.170, P < 0.001). Therefore, TT genotype of rs2941484 in the human HNF4G gene might be a gender -specific genetic marker for hyperuricemia in Chinese Han men.",

To determine the relapse rate in patients with UC in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission and identify factors that may influence the risk of relapse. Patients with UC in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission were enrolled between January-July 2010 and followed up for 1 year to determine the effect of clinical, dietary and psychological factors on relapse. Information regarding factors that may affect relapse such as infection, antibiotic or NSAIDs use and any other factor which the patient felt important, and compliance with medications was obtained. 97 patients (59 males, mean age 39 + 11.9 years) were followed up for a mean duration of 9 + 2.3 months. 18(18.6%) relapsed with the median time to relapse being 3.5 months. On univariate analysis more relapsers had significantly higher NSAIDs use within 15 days of relapse, respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks, use of steroids more than once in past, higher consumption of calcium, riboflavin, vitamin A and lower consumption of sugars. On multivariate analysis, NSAIDs use [HR(95%CI):6.41(1.88-21.9)]and intake of Vitamin A [HR(95%CI):1.008(1.000-1.016)] were statistically significant predictors of relapse.

A standardised anaesthetic protocol was used. Oesophageal and rectal temperatures were measured at various time points. At the end of surgery, group 1 patients (n=10) were lavaged with 200 ml/kg sterile isotonic saline at 34±1°C and group 2 (n=10) at 40±1°C. Groups were similar with respect to age, mass, body condition and surgical incision length. Duration of anaesthesia, surgical procedures and peritoneal lavage was similar between groups. Linear regression showed no significant change in oesophageal temperature during the lavage period for group 1 (P=0.64), but a significant increase for group 2 patients (P<0.0001), with mean temperature changes of -0.5°C (from (36.3°C to 35.9°C) and +0.9°C (from 35.4°C to 36.3°C), respectively. Similar results were found for rectal temperature, with mean changes of -0.5°C and +0.8°C (P=0.922 and 0.045), respectively.

Therefore, a nationwide epidemiologic survey of iNPH was performed to determine the number of cases and clinical characteristics by sex and diagnostic level. The first survey examined the numbers of cases that met the diagnostic criteria of iNPH and those who underwent shunt operations in 2012. The second survey gathered patients ' details to clarify their clinical background characteristics. The estimated number of cases meeting the diagnostic criteria in 2012 was 12,900, with 6,700 undergoing shunt operations. The estimated crude prevalence was 10.2/100,000 persons. The age of onset was in the 70s in more than 50% of both men and women. Significantly higher (p < .05) frequencies of gait impairment in men and cognitive decline in women were observed as initial symptoms. At the time of definitive diagnosis, gait impairment was observed most frequently in patients with definite iNPH (77.7%). Hypertension was the most frequent comorbidity (40.0%), followed by diabetes mellitus (17.8%) and Alzheimer's disease (14.8%). Hypertension was observed more frequently in men, but diabetes was observed more frequently in women (p < .05). An LP shunt was the first-choice (55.1%) treatment of iNPH, followed by a VP shunt (43.2%). This study showed that iNPH occurs most frequently in the 70s, gait impairment and cognitive decline are the most frequent initial symptoms in men and women, respectively, and hypertension and diabetes are the most frequent comorbidities in men and women, respectively.",

Subjects were 5th-grade children from 70 elementary schools in 17 cities nationwide. Two-stage stratified cluster sampling was employed. Survey questionnaire included items related to general characteristics, eating habits, PA, nutrition knowledge and self-efficacy. Excluding incomplete responses, 3,531 data were analyzed using SPSS. Subjects were categorized into overweight·obesity (OW) and normal weight (NW) groups based on body mass index percentiles for age by sex. A total of 21.5% of subjects was overweight or obese. There were significant differences in gender, perceived stress, perception of body shape, body satisfaction, and interest in weight control between the OW and NW groups (P < 0.001). With respect to eating habits, the OW group ate breakfast (P < 0.05) and snacks (P < 0.01) less frequently, ate bigger meals (P < 0.001), and demonstrated less desirable behaviors during meals (P <0.05 in boys) compared to the NW group. The OW group participated in less PA than the NW group, especially boys. OW boys spent less time walking during weekdays (P < 0.05) or the weekend (P < 0.001), spent more time being sedentary during weekdays or the weekend (P < 0.001), and exercised a fewer number of days (P < 0.01). For girls, the OW group spent more time being sedentary during the weekend (P < 0.01) and exercised a fewer number of days by walking or bicycle riding (P < 0.05) than the NW group. Nutrition knowledge was not significantly different between the OW and NW groups. Self-efficacy (P < 0.01 in boys), especially PA self-efficacy (P < 0.01), was significantly lower in the OW than NW group. This study revealed differences in eating habits, PA, and self-efficacy between OW and NW children. Obesity management programs for children need to focus on increasing self-efficacy, modifying eating habits, and increasing PA.",
  "27919317": "Drosophila neprilysins control insulin signaling and food intake via cleavage of regulatory peptides Insulin and IGF signaling are critical to numerous developmental and physiological processes, with perturbations being pathognomonic of various diseases, including diabetes. Although the functional roles of the respective signaling pathways have been extensively studied, the control of insulin production and release is only partially understood. Herein, we show that in Drosophila expression of insulin-like peptides is regulated by neprilysin activity. Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor. A screen for corresponding substrates of the neprilysin identified distinct peptides that regulate insulin-like peptide expression, feeding behavior, or both. The high functional conservation of neprilysins and their substrates renders the characterized principles applicable to numerous species, including higher eukaryotes and humans.",
  "28471040": "Farnesylthiosalicylic acid -loaded lipid-polyethylene glycol-polymer hybrid nanoparticles for treatment of glioblastoma We aimed to develop lipid-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, which have high affinity to tumour tissue with active ingredient, a new generation antineoplastic drug, farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTA) for treatment of glioblastoma. Farnesylthiosalicylic acid -loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-1,2 distearoyl-glycerol-3-phospho-ethanolamine-N [methoxy (PEG)-2000] ammonium salt (PLGA-DSPE-PEG) with or without 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) hybrid nanoparticles has been prepared and evaluated for in-vitro characterization. Cytotoxicity of FTA-loaded nanoparticles along with its efficacy on rat glioma-2 (RG2) cells was also evaluated both in vitro (in comparison with non-malignant cell line, L929) and in vivo. Scanning electron microscopy studies showed that all formulations prepared had smooth surface and spherical in shape. FTA and FTA-loaded nanoparticles have cytotoxic activity against RG2 glioma cell lines in cell culture studies, which further increases with addition of DOTAP. Magnetic resonance imaging and histopathologic evaluation on RG2 tumour cells in rat glioma model (49 female Wistar rats, 250-300 g) comparing intravenous and intratumoral injections of the drug have been performed and FTA-loaded nanoparticles reduced tumour size significantly in in-vivo studies, with higher efficiency of intratumoral administration than intravenous route. Farnesylthiosalicylic acid -loaded PLGA-DSPE-PEG-DOTAP hybrid nanoparticles are proven to be effective against glioblastoma in both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments.",
  "28039304": "Allergen Valency, Dose, and FcεRI Occupancy Set Thresholds for Secretory Responses to Pen a 1 and Motivate Design of Hypoallergens Ag -mediated crosslinking of IgE - FcεRI complexes activates mast cells and basophils, initiating the allergic response. Of 34 donors recruited having self-reported shrimp allergy, only 35% had significant levels of shrimp-specific IgE in serum and measurable basophil secretory responses to rPen a 1 (shrimp tropomyosin). We report that degranulation is linked to the number of FcεRI occupied with allergen-specific IgE, as well as the dose and valency of Pen a 1. Using clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat-based gene editing, human RBL(rαKO) cells were created that exclusively express the human FcεRIα subunit. Pen a 1 - specific IgE was affinity purified from shrimp - positive plasma. Cells primed with a range of Pen a 1 - specific IgE and challenged with Pen a 1 showed a bell-shaped dose response for secretion, with optimal Pen a 1 doses of 0.1-10 ng/ml. Mathematical modeling provided estimates of receptor aggregation kinetics based on FcεRI occupancy with IgE and allergen dose. Maximal degranulation was elicited when ∼2700 I gE - FcεRI complexes were occupied with specific IgE and challenged with Pen a 1 (IgE epitope valency of ≥8), although measurable responses were achieved when only a few hundred FcεRI were occupied. Prolonged periods of pepsin -mediated Pen a 1 proteolysis, which simulates gastric digestion, were required to diminish secretory responses. Recombinant fragments (60-79 aa), which together span the entire length of tropomyosin, were weak secretagogues. These fragments have reduced dimerization capacity, compete with intact Pen a 1 for binding to IgE - FcεRI complexes, and represent a starting point for the design of promising hypoallergens for immunotherapy.",
  "27512369": "Interoception and Positive Symptoms in Schizophrenia The present study focuses on the multifaceted concept of self-disturbance in schizophrenia, adding knowledge about a not yet investigated aspect, which is the interoceptive accuracy. Starting from the assumption that interoceptive accuracy requires an intact sense of self, which otherwise was proved to be altered in schizophrenia, the aim of the present study was to explore interoceptive accuracy in a group of schizophrenia patients, compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, the possible association between interoceptive accuracy and patients ' positive and negative symptomatology was assessed. To pursue these goals, a group of 23 schizophrenia patients and a group of 23 healthy controls performed a heartbeat perception task. Patients ' symptomatology was assessed by means of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results demonstrated significantly lower interoceptive accuracy in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. This difference was not accounted for participants ' age, BMI, anxiety levels, and heart rate. Furthermore, patients ' illness severity, attention and pharmacological treatment did not influence their interoceptive accuracy levels. Interestingly, a strong positive relation between interoceptive accuracy and positive symptoms severity, especially Grandiosity, was found. The present results demonstrate for the first time that interoceptive accuracy is altered in schizophrenia. Furthermore, they prove a specific association between interoceptive accuracy and positive symptomatology, suggesting that the symptom Grandiosity might be protective against an altered basic sense of self in patients characterized by higher sensibility to their inner bodily sensations.",

While excellent long-term durability of repair using PTFE neochordae has been established, there have been rare reports of neochordal rupture at various times after surgery. We report a case of artificial chordal rupture 10 years after anterior mitral leaflet repair, necessitating reoperation. This complication may have been precipitated by maldistributed intracardiac tensile forces as a consequence of a malpositioned annuloplasty band.",
  "27851729": "In vivo genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homology-independent targeted integration Targeted genome editing via engineered nucleases is an exciting area of biomedical research and holds potential for clinical applications. Despite rapid advances in the field, in vivo targeted transgene integration is still infeasible because current tools are inefficient, especially for non-dividing cells, which compose most adult tissues. This poses a barrier for uncovering fundamental biological principles and developing treatments for a broad range of genetic disorders. Based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, here we devise a homology-independent targeted integration (HITI) strategy, which allows for robust DNA knock-in in both dividing and non-dividing cells in vitro and, more importantly, in vivo (for example, in neurons of postnatal mammals). As a proof of concept of its therapeutic potential, we demonstrate the efficacy of HITI in improving visual function using a rat model of the retinal degeneration condition retinitis pigmentosa. The HITI method presented here establishes new avenues for basic research and targeted gene therapies.",
  "28273224": "Emergency cricothyrotomy: temporary measure or definitive airway? A systematic review Being a fast and safe method in the hands of well trained professionals in both prehospital and intrahospital care, Cricothyrotomy has been broadly recommended as the initial surgical airway in the scenario \" can't intubate, can't ventilate \", and is particularly useful when the obstruction level is above or at the glottis. Its prolonged permanence, however, is an endless source of controversy. In this review we evaluate the complications of cricothyrotomy and the need of its routine conversion to tracheotomy through a search on PubMed, LILACS and SciELO electronic databases with no restriction to the year or language of the publication. In total, we identified 791 references, retrieved 20 full text articles, and included nine studies in our review. The incidence of short-term complications ranged from zero to 31.6%, and the long-term complications, from zero to 7.86%. Subglotic stenosis was the main long-term reported complication, even though it was quite infrequent, occurring only in 2.9 to 5%. The frequency of conversion to tracheostomy varied from zero to 100%. Although a small frequency of long-term complications was found for emergency cricothyrotomy, the studies' low level of evidence does not allow the recommendation of routine use of cricothyrotomy as a secure definitive airway.",
  "27234004": "Factors preventing kneeling in a group of pre-educated patients post total knee arthroplasty Difficulties in kneeling, one of the poorest scoring functional outcomes post total knee arthroplasty (TKA),have been attributed to a lack of patient education. This is the first study to investigate specific factors affecting a patient's perceived ability to kneel post TKA, following exposure to a preoperative kneeling education session. A cross-sectional study was conducted following TKA with patients who had been educated about kneeling prior to the operation. Patients completed kneeling questionnaires at 6 (n = 115) and 12 (n = 82) months post TKA. In addition to the 12-month kneeling questionnaire, patients also completed the Oxford knee score (OKS) survey. Seventy-two percent of patients perceived they could kneel at 12 months post TKA. Overall, pain and discomfort were the most common factors deterring patients from kneeling. Perceived kneeling ability was the poorest scored outcome on the OKS with patients reporting mild to moderate difficulty with this task. Kneeling scores were strongly correlated with overall knee function scores (R = 0.70), strongly correlated with pain scores (R = 0.45) and weakly correlated with knee stability scores (R = 0.29). When asked about other factors preventing kneeling other than pain or discomfor t, 75 % had reasons unrelated to the knee or TKA. The most common reason was 'problems with the other knee ' (n = 19). Patients in this study were provided with education regarding their kneeling ability post TKA, yet still experienced limitations in perceived kneeling ability post operatively. Contrary to previous research, our study suggests that factors other than patient education affect a patient's perceived kneeling ability post TKA.",
  "28464953": "The efficacy of human placenta -derived mesenchymal stem cells on radiation enteropathy along with proteomic biomarkers predicting a favorable response Radiation enteropathy is a common complication in patients with abdominopelvic cancer, but no treatment has yet been established. Stem cell therapy may be a viable therapeutic option because intestinal stem cells are highly vulnerable to ionizing radiation (IR) and stem cell loss explains its intractability to general treatment. Here, we investigated either prophylactic or therapeutic efficacy of human placenta -derived mesenchymal stem cells (hPDSCs) against radiation enteropathy and could identify biomarkers predicting a favorable response to stem cell therapy. We challenged a radiation-induced enteropathy model with hPDSCs. After sacrifice, we checked the gross anatomy of small intestine, histology gross, and analyzed that, accompanied with molecular changes implicated in this model. hPDSCs significantly improved the outcome of mice induced with either radiation enteropathy or lethal radiation syndrome (P < 0.01). hPDSCs exerted inhibitory actions on inflammatory cytokines, the re-establishment of epithelium homeostasis was completed with increasing endogenous restorative processes as assessed with increased levels of proliferative markers in the hPDSCs group, and a significant inhibition of IR - induced apoptosis. The preservation of cells expressing lysozyme, and Musashi-1 were significantly increased in the hPDSC treatment group. Both preventive and therapeutic efficacies of hPDSCs were noted against IR-induced enteropathy. Label-free quantification was used to identify biomarkers which predict favorable responses after hPDSC treatment, and finally glutathione S-transferase-mu type, interleukin-10, and peroxiredoxin-2 were validated as proteomic biomarkers predicting a favorable response to hPDSCs in radiation enteropathy. hPDSCs may be a useful prophylactic and therapeutic cell therapy for radiation enteropathy.",
  "27687951": "Inter-observer agreement for clinical examinations of foot lesions of sheep In sheep, the diagnosis of foot lesions is routinely based on physical examination of the hoof. Correct diagnosis is important for the effective treatment, prevention and control of both infectious and non-infectious causes of lameness. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the level of inter-observer agreement for clinical examination of ovine foot lesions. Eight observers of varying experience, training and occupation performed foot examinations on a total of 1158 sheep from 38 farms across North England and Wales. On each farm, a group of two to four observers independently examined a sample of 24 to 30 sheep to diagnose the presence or absence of specific foot lesions including white line lesions (WL), contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD), footrot (FR), inter-digital dermatitis (ID) and toe granuloma (TG). The inter-observer agreement of foot lesion assessments was examined using Fleiss kappa (κ), and Cohen's κ examined the paired agreement between the test standard observer (TSO) and each observer. Scoring differences with the TSO were examined as the percentage of scoring errors and assessed for evidence of systematic scoring bias. With the exception of WL (maximum error rate 33.3%), few scoring differences with the TSO occurred (maximum error rate 3.3%). This suggests that observers can achieve good levels of reliability when diagnosing most of the commonly observed foot conditions associated with lameness in sheep.",
  "27873506": "Development of a Robotic Colonoscopic Manipulation System, Using Haptic Feedback Algorithm Colonoscopy is one of the most effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools for colorectal diseases. We aim to propose a master-slave robotic colonoscopy that is controllable in remote site using conventional colonoscopy. The master and slave robot were developed to use conventional flexible colonoscopy. The robotic colonoscopic procedure was performed using a colonoscope training model by one expert endoscopist and two unexperienced engineers. To provide the haptic sensation, the insertion force and the rotating torque were measured and sent to the master robot. A slave robot was developed to hold the colonoscopy and its knob, and perform insertion, rotation, and two tilting motions of colonoscope. A master robot was designed to teach motions of the slave robot. These measured force and torque were scaled down by one tenth to provide the operator with some reflection force and torque at the haptic device. The haptic sensation and feedback system was successful and helpful to feel the constrained force or torque in colon. The insertion time using robotic system decreased with repeated procedures. This work proposed a robotic approach for colonoscopy using haptic feedback algorithm, and this robotic device would effectively perform colonoscopy with reduced burden and comparable safety for patients in remote site.",
  "28470753": "Stalk versus base invasion in pT1 papillary cancers of the bladder: improved substaging system predicting risk of progression Pathologic stage T1 (pT1) bladder cancers are a clinically heterogeneous group. However, current staging guidelines for superficially invasive cancers do not acknowledge the variability in type and extent of lamina propria invasion in papillary urothelial carcinomas (PUC), and historically proposed substaging systems showed either high inter-observer variation or limited value in predicting patient outcomes. Herein we reappraise pT1 PUC substaging, aiming to identify a novel scheme which is reproducible and prognostically meaningful. Stage pT1 PUC diagnosed during years 1999-2015 were retrospectively reviewed and characterized as focal invasion confined to papillary stalk, focal invasion of tumor base, or extensive invasion of tumor base. Cases with concurrent flat carcinoma in-situ, angiolymphatic invasion, absent muscularis propria, or clinically advanced disease were excluded. We calculated cumulative incidence of recurrence, progression, and death by tumor subtype and evaluated differential risks using log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by type and extent of invasion. Among 62 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 22 of 29 patients with base extensive invasion progressed while 4 of 13 with base focal and 0 of 20 with stalk only invasion progressed. There was strong evidence that base extensive patients had higher risk of progression and death due to bladder cancer than base focal or stalk only counterparts (P<0.0001). However, tumor subtype was not significantly associated with risk of recurrence (P=0.21). We propose an innovative substaging approach for reporting site and extent of lamina propria invasion in patients with pT1 PUC allowing patient stratification for risk of progression.

  "27469526": "The role of sub-hippocampal versus hippocampal regions in bitemporal lobe epilepsies We aimed at better delineating the functional anatomical organization of bitemporal lobe epilepsy. We studied the epileptogenic zone (EZ) by quantifying the epileptogenicity of brain structures explored by depth electrodes in patients investigated by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). We compared 15 patients with bilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (BTLE) and 15 patients with unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (UTLE). This quantification was performed using the ' Epileptogenicity Index ' (EI). Age at epilepsy onset, and epilepsy duration, were not statistically different in both groups. UTLE patients more frequently displayed maximal epileptogenicity in hippocampal structures, whereas BTLE patients had maximal values in subhippocampal areas (entorhinal cortex, temporal pole, parahippocampal cortex). Our results suggest different organization of the EZ in the two groups. BTLE was associated with more involvement of subhippocampal regions, a result in agreement with known anatomical connections between the two temporal lobes.",

We compared performance on a novel test of visuospatial ability - the LSD - with the IPT, CDT and MMSE in 180 acute elderly medical inpatients [mean age 79.7±7.1 (range 62-96); 91 females (50.6%)]. 124 (69%) scored ≤23 on the MMSE; 60 with mild (score 18-23) and 64 with severe (score ≤17) impairment. 78 (43%) scored ≥6 on the CDT, while for the IPT, 87 (47%) scored ≥4. The CDT and IPT agreed on the classification of 138 patients (77%) with modest- strong agreement with the MMSE categories. Correlation between the LSD and visuospatial tests was high. A four-item version of the LSD incorporating items 1,10,12,15 had high correlation with the LSD-15 and strong association with MMSE categories. The LSD-4 provides a brief and easily interpreted bedside test of visuospatial function that has high coverage of elderly patients with neurocognitive impairment, good agreement with conventional tests of visuospatial ability and favourable ability to identify significant cognitive impairment.

  "27708714": "The presence of two rare genomic syndromes, 1q21 deletion and Xq28 duplication, segregating independently in a family with intellectual disability 1q21 microdeletion syndrome is a rare contiguous gene deletion disorder with de novo or autosomal dominant inheritance patterns and its phenotypic features include intellectual disability, distinctive facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, cardiac abnormalities, and cataracts. MECP2 duplication syndrome is an X-linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and other neurological complications including late-onset seizures. Previously, these two different genetic syndromes have not been reported segregating independently in a same family. Here we describe two siblings carrying either a chromosome 1q21 microdeletion or a chromosome Xq28 duplication. Using a comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array, we identified a 1.24 Mb heterozygous deletion at 1q21 resulting in the loss of 9 genes in a girl with learning disability, hypothyroidism, short stature, sensory integration disorder, and soft dysmorphic features including cupped ears and a unilateral ear pit. We also characterized a 508 kb Xq28 duplication encompassing MECP2 in her younger brother with hypotonia, poor speech, cognitive and motor impairment. The parental CGH and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses revealed that the 1q21 deletion in the elder sister is de novo, but the Xq28 duplication in the younger brother was originally inherited from the maternal grandmother through the mother, both of whom are asymptomatic carriers. RT-qPCR assays revealed that the affected brother has almost double the amount of MECP2 mRNA expression compared to other family members of both genders including maternal grandmother and mother who have the same Xq28 duplication with no phenotype. This suggests the X chromosome with an Xq28 duplication in the carrier females is preferentially silenced. From our understanding, this would be the first report showing the independent segregation of two genetically unrelated syndromes, 1q21 microdeletion and Xq28 duplication, in a same family, especially in siblings. Although these two chromosomal abnormalities share some similar phenotypes such as intellectual disability, mild dysmorphic features, and cardiac abnormalities, the presence of two unrelated and rare syndromes in siblings is very unusual. Therefore, further comprehensive investigations in similar cases are required for future studies.",
  "27764968": "The relationship between anthropometry and body composition from computed tomography: The Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America Study Few studies examine the relationships between anthropometry and the body composition measures they approximate, or whether they differ by sex, and no studies have examined these relationships in South Asians living in the US. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 871 participants in the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) Study who had BMI < 40 kg/m(2) and underwent abdominal CT scans for measurement of visceral and subcutaneous fat. Linear regression was used to model the associations between anthropometric measures and naturally log-transformed body composition measures. All measures of anthropometry, except height, were significantly associated with visceral fat and had a significant non-linear component (p < .05). The only associations for visceral fat that exhibited significant heterogeneity by sex were waist circumference (% difference in visceral fat slope: women 1.92, men 2.74, p = .007 for interaction) and waist-to-hip ratio (women 25.9, men 717.4, p < .001). Except for height, all measures of anthropometry were significantly associated with subcutaneous fat, had a significant quadratic component, and significant heterogeneity by sex (weight (kg): 2.74 for women, 4.08 for men; BMI (kg/m(2)): 10.3, 14.0; waist circumference (cm): 1.51, 3.36; hip circumference (cm): 2.53, 4.50) with p < .001 for each. In MASALA participants, the relationships of anthropometric measures with visceral and subcutaneous fat appear similar to other race / ethnic groups, but with weaker non-linearity and heterogeneity by sex. Given these results, researchers should consider separate models by sex for US South Asians when approximating subcutaneous fat or when using waist circumference to approximate visceral fat."
