The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of crown fracture in the primary dentition over a 1-year follow-up period, identify risk factors, and test the hypothesis that children with previous crown fracture are more prone to experience further cases of crown fracture independently of other risk factors. This study was developed in two phases: cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal study. The cross-sectional study was carried out 261 preschool children. The prospective longitudinal study was carried out 194 children allocated to two groups: exposed group (children with prior exposure to crown fracture) and non - exposed group (children without prior exposure). On both occasions, children were examined for the diagnosis of crown fracture and evaluation of lip coverage and overjet. The parents were interviewed with regard to the socioeconomic indicators. New cases of crown fracture were identified based on the comparison of the two examinations. Data analysis involved Pearson's chi-square test, McNemar's test, and Poisson regression with robust variance. Among the 261 children who participated in the cross-sectional study, 194 were re-examined (65 in the exposed group and 129 in the non - exposed group). The overall incidence of crown fracture was 55.7% (n = 108). The difference in percentage of increased risk of crown fracture in exposed and non - exposed groups was 13.4%. A greater incidence of crown fracture was found in the exposed group (64.6%; P < 0,001). The children exposed (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.01-1.67) had a greater risk of developing new cases of crown fracture in comparison with the non - exposed group. The incidence of crown fracture was high and children with previous crown fracture had a greater risk of suffering new cases of crown fracture during the 1-year follow-up period.",

Seventy-seven male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: Control Group (for resistance); Group E (polypropylene mesh); and Group U (polypropylene / poliglecaprone mesh). The animals in Groups E and U had a standard muscular and aponeurotic defect, with integral peritoneum, and correction with the mesh. Measurements were taken 4, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days after surgery. The resistance, and collagen density were studied. Resistance on the 56th day was similar in both meshes. The gain in resistance described an ascending curve for the polypropylene mesh and was irregular in the case of the polypropylene / poliglecaprone. Fibroplasia showed a gain in type I and type III collagen in both groups (p<0.001). Collagen III stabilized in the 14th day and collagen I continued to ascend. The gain in resistance of the polypropylene mesh is regular and ascending, whereas the polypropylene / poliglecaprone is not regular. The final resistance of both meshes is similar; the collagen density increases over time, and show the same inflammatory potential.",
  "27251918": "The role of catheter ablation in the management of atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is driven by spontaneous electrical activation emerging from the pulmonary veins. Catheter ablation using either radiofrequency or cryothermal energy electrically isolates these veins from the left atrium, both reducing the burden of atrial fibrillation episodes and improving the patient's symptoms. Catheter ablation is superior to antiarryhthmic drugs when patients are carefully selected. Underlying medical problems - including obesity, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea - should be optimally treated before considering ablation. Although this treatment has the potential to cure patients of their symptoms, they should be aware of the important associated procedural complications.",
  "27255214": "Hierarchical Targeting Strategy for Enhanced Tumor Tissue Accumulation / Retention and Cellular Internalization Targeted delivery of therapeutic agents is an important way to improve the therapeutic index and reduce side effects. To design nanoparticles for targeted delivery, both enhanced tumor tissue accumulation / retention and enhanced cellular internalization should be considered simultaneously. So far, there have been very few nanoparticles with immutable structures that can achieve this goal efficiently. Hierarchical targeting, a novel targeting strategy based on stimuli responsiveness, shows good potential to enhance both tumor tissue accumulation / retention and cellular internalization. Here, the recent design and development of hierarchical targeting nanoplatforms, based on changeable particle sizes, switchable surface charges and activatable surface ligands, will be introduced. In general, the targeting moieties in these nanoplatforms are not activated during blood circulation for efficient tumor tissue accumulation, but re-activated by certain internal or external stimuli in the tumor microenvironment for enhanced cellular internalization.",
  "27274281": "Evaluation of response from axitinib per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors versus Choi criteria in previously treated patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma Axitinib, a selective and potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, was available to patients from Canada and Australia, prior to regulatory approval of axitinib in these countries, for treatment of clear-cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) after failure of one prior systemic regimen. This single-arm, open-label study of axitinib evaluated the efficacy, safety, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with mRCC whose disease progressed after one prior systemic first-line regimen. Primary objective was objective response rate evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Choi criteria. Progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and QoL were secondary end points. Due to the small study size, analyses comprised of descriptive statistics. Fifteen patients were recruited, five from Canada and ten from Australia, over a limited recruitment period. Thirteen patients received sunitinib as prior therapy. All patients had clear-cell carcinoma, eleven had prior nephrectomy. Liver, lung, and lymph nodes were the most frequent sites of metastases; one patient had brain metastasis. Median time on axitinib was 118.0 days (range: 3.5-645.0 days); estimated survival probability at 12 months was 57.8%. Two (13.3%) patients had objective responses per RECIST versus nine (60.0%) per Choi criteria. Six patients had progressive disease based on RECIST versus three per Choi criteria. Nine (60.0%) events of progression or death occurred by the end of study, and three patients continued to receive the study drug. Fatigue (33%) and diarrhea (20%) were the most common grade ≥3 all-causality, treatment -emergent adverse events. The mean change in European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions score from baseline to end of treatment was -0.0837. The small number of patients and lack of a comparator arm limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions; however, safety and efficacy profiles of axitinib were consistent with reports from previous studies in patients with mRCC, and patients generally maintained QoL. The sizeable difference observed in objective response rate by RECIST versus Choi criteria merits further research.",
  "27284491": "Mutation profiles of synchronous colorectal cancers from a patient with Lynch syndrome suggest distinct oncogenic pathways Patients with Lynch syndrome often present with multiple synchronous or metachronous colorectal cancers (CRCs). The presence of multiple CRCs with distinct genetic profiles and driver mutations could complicate treatment as each cancer may respond differently to therapy. Studies of sporadic CRCs suggested that synchronous tumors have distinct etiologies, but could not rule out differences in genetic background. The presence of multiple cancers in a patient with a predisposing mutation provides an opportunity to profile synchronous cancers in the same genetic background. Here, we describe the case of a patient with Lynch syndrome that presented with six synchronous CRCs. Microsatellite instability (MSI) and genomic profiling indicated that each lesion had a unique pattern of instability and a distinct profile of affected genes. These findings support the idea that in Lynch syndrome, synchronous CRCs can develop in parallel with distinct mutation profiles and that these differences may inform treatment decisions.",
  "27010511": "Application of an Analytical Solution as a Screening Tool for Sea Water Intrusion Sea water intrusion into aquifers is problematic in many coastal areas. The physics and chemistry of this issue are complex, and sea water intrusion remains challenging to quantify. Simple assessment tools like analytical models offer advantages of rapid application, but their applicability to field situations is unclear. This study examines the reliability of a popular sharp-interface analytical approach for estimating the extent of sea water in a homogeneous coastal aquifer subjected to pumping and regional flow effects and under steady-state conditions. The analytical model is tested against observations from Canada, the United States, and Australia to assess its utility as an initial approximation of sea water extent for the purposes of rapid groundwater management decision making. The occurrence of sea water intrusion resulting in increased salinity at pumping wells was correctly predicted in approximately 60% of cases. Application of a correction to account for dispersion did not markedly improve the results. Failure of the analytical model to provide correct predictions can be attributed to mismatches between its simplifying assumptions and more complex field settings. The best results occurred where the toe of the salt water wedge is expected to be the closest to the coast under predevelopment conditions. Predictions were the poorest for aquifers where the salt water wedge was expected to extend further inland under predevelopment conditions and was therefore more dispersive prior to pumping. Sharp-interface solutions remain useful tools to screen for the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to sea water intrusion, although the significant sources of uncertainty identified in this study require careful consideration to avoid misinterpreting sharp-interface results.",
  "27250823": "Diagnostic utility of additional conventional techniques after endobronchial ultrasonography guidance during transbronchial biopsy Endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath transbronchial biopsy (EBUS - GS TBB) has been used to diagnose peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs). In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic utility of conventional TBB after EBUS - GS TBB. A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent conventional TBB after EBUS - GS TBB for PPL between August 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014. We performed multivariate analysis to examine the association of various clinical factors, including EBUS probe distance and sample size area, with diagnostic yield. Of 88 eligible patients, 57 (65%) were successfully diagnosed by EBUS - GS TBB. In 31 patients not diagnosed by EBUS - GS TBB, 15 (48%) were successfully diagnosed by additional conventional TBB. Ground glass opacity (GGO) was a significant factor associated with the diagnostic yield of additional conventional TBB following EBUS - GS TBB. Multivariate analysis and receiver operator curves revealed that distance between the PPL and the EBUS probe of less than 2.55 mm favored the utility of conventional TBB. Additional conventional TBB after EBUS - GS TBB could be a useful procedure for the diagnosis of ground glass opacity PPLs and in cases of a distance of less than 2.55 mm between the EBUS probe and the lesion.",

HERG1 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 62 patients with oral leukoplakias and 100 patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). HERG1 mRNA levels were assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 22 patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Statistically significant associations were found between HERG1 expression and tobacco consumption, disease stage, tumor differentiation, tumor recurrence, and reduced survival. There was no association between HERG1 expression and the risk of progression from oral leukoplakia to OSCC. In addition, a high proportion of tumors (80%) showed increased HERG1 mRNA levels compared to normal mucosa from nononcologic patients. Aberrant HERG1 expression increases as oral tumorigenesis progresses from oral hyperplasia to OSCC. Increased HERG1 mRNA levels were also frequently detected in OSCC and other HNSCC subsites. HERG1 expression emerges as a clinically relevant feature during tumor progression and a potential poor prognostic biomarker for OSCC. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: 1708-1716, 2016.",

  "27252416": "Heterogeneous Mechanisms of Primary and Acquired Resistance to Third-Generation EGFR Inhibitors To identify novel mechanisms of resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors in patients with lung adenocarcinoma that progressed under therapy with either AZD9291 or rociletinib (CO-1686). We analyzed tumor biopsies from seven patients obtained before, during, and/or after treatment with AZD9291 or rociletinib (CO-1686). Targeted sequencing and FISH analyses were performed, and the relevance of candidate genes was functionally assessed in in vitro models. We found recurrent amplification of either MET or ERBB2 in tumors that were resistant or developed resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and show that ERBB2 and MET activation can confer resistance to these compounds. Furthermore, we identified a KRAS(G12S) mutation in a patient with acquired resistance to AZD9291 as a potential driver of acquired resistance. Finally, we show that dual inhibition of EGFR /MEK might be a viable strategy to overcome resistance in EGFR-mutant cells expressing mutant KRAS CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance can drive primary and acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and provide a rationale for potential combination strategies.

This is a cross-sectional school-based study with a representative sample of 3992 students aged 14-19 years from the state of Sergipe, Brazil. The outcome was low consumption of fruits and vegetables (<5 servings/day). Independent variables were: level of physical activity, sedentary behavior, consumption of soft drinks, and overweight / obesity. Global Student Health Survey questionnaire and body mass and height measurements were used, as well as chi-square test and crude and adjusted binary logistic regression. The significance level adopted was 5%. The prevalence of inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables was high - 88.6% (95% CI =87.6-89.5). Higher likelihood of low consumption of fruits and vegetables was verified among boys who were exposed to sedentary behavior (OR =1.63; 95% CI =1.18-2.24), who consumed soft drinks (OR =3.04; 95% CI =2.10-4.40), with insufficiently physical activity (OR =1.98; 95% CI =1.43-2.73) and girls who consumed soft drinks (OR =1.88; 95% CI =1.43-2.47) and those with overweight / obesity (OR =1.63; 95% CI =1.19-2.23).

The current study investigated the impacts of VCD on selected hepatic and renal markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in both sexes of Wistar rats. Thus, male and female rats were randomly distributed into four groups of ten rats per group, and dosed orally with VCD for 28 days. The control male and female groups of rats received corn oil only, while each of the three remaining groups of both sexes of rats received VCD (100, 250 and 500 mg/kg BW) respectively. Thereafter, biomarkers of hepatic and renal oxidative damage, inflammation and immunohistochemical expressions of iNOS, COX-2, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were evaluated. The results revealed that VCD increased markers of liver and kidney functions, oxidative damage and inflammation, and disrupted the antioxidant homeostasis of the rats (p<0.05). Lastly, VCD enhanced the immunohistochemical expressions of iNOS, COX-2, caspase-9 and caspase-3 in the liver of the rats. Thus, our data imply that VCD induced toxicity in the liver and kidney of rats via the combined impacts of oxidative damage and inflammation.",
  "27233131": "Impact of cofactor - binding loop mutations on thermotolerance and activity of E. coli transketolase Improvement of thermostability in engineered enzymes can allow biocatalysis on substrates with poor aqueous solubility. Denaturation of the cofactor - binding loops of Escherichia coli transketolase (TK) was previously linked to the loss of enzyme activity under conditions of high pH or urea. Incubation at temperatures just below the thermal melting transition, above which the protein aggregates, was also found to anneal the enzyme to give an increased specific activity. The potential role of cofactor - binding loop instability in this process remained unclear. In this work, the two cofactor - binding loops (residues 185-192 and 382-392) were progressively mutated towards the equivalent sequence from the thermostable Thermus thermophilus TK and variants assessed for their impact on both thermostability and activity. Cofactor-binding loop 2 variants had detrimental effects on specific activity at elevated temperatures, whereas the H192P mutation in cofactor-binding loop 1 resulted in a two-fold improved stability to inactivation at elevated temperatures, and increased the critical onset temperature for aggregation. The specific activity of H192P was 3-fold and 19-fold higher than that for wild-type at 60°C and 65°C respectively, and also remained 2.7-4 fold higher after re-cooling from pre-incubations at either 55°C or 60°C for 1h. Interestingly, H192P was also 2-times more active than wild-type TK at 25°C. Optimal activity was achieved at 60°C for H192P compared to 55°C for wild type. These results show that cofactor-binding loop 1, plays a pivotal role in partial denaturation and aggregation at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, a single rigidifying mutation within this loop can significantly improve the enzyme specific activity, as well as the stability to thermal denaturation and aggregation, to give an increased temperature optimum for activity.",
  "27260627": "Associations of Body Mass Index and Physical Activity With Sexual Dysfunction in Breast Cancer Survivors Sexual dysfunction is a common and distressing consequence of breast cancer (BC) treatment. In the present study, we investigated the sexual functioning of BC patients and its association with women's personal characteristics and cancer treatments. In this cross-sectional study, sexual function was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and its breast module BR-23. Of the 235 participants approached, 216 participants were included in the study. Of these, 63 patients reported no sexual activity in the last month and thus were analyzed only in relation to the sexual desire domain of FSFI. A total of 154 (71.3 %) patients were classified with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). From those patients reporting sexual activity in the last month, 63.3 % (97 out of 153) were classified with sexual dysfunction. Using hierarchical logistic regression, the variance explained (change in R (2)) by the addition of body mass index (BMI) and mild to moderate physical activity in the prediction models of sexual dysfunction and HSDD were 6.8 and 7.2 %, respectively. Age, BMI, and physical activity were independently associated with sexual dysfunction and HSDD. Additionally, BC patients with sexual dysfunction reported lower scores on global HRQOL, role functioning, and fatigue. Based on our findings, BC survivors should be encouraged to practice regular physical activity and to lose weight in order to avoid sexual dysfunction. However, future clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.",
  "27259326": "Effect of Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Combined with Argon-Helium Cryosurgery System on the Changes of NK Cells and T Cell Subsets in Peripheral Blood of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive tumors in humans. T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells are the body's first line of defense to prevent tumor cell growth. Previous studies have demonstrated that transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with argon-helium cryosurgery system (AHCS) can effectively treat liver cancer. However, the mechanism of the treatment is unclear yet. In the current study, we investigated the effects of TACE combined with AHCS on the changes of T cell subsets and NK cells in peripheral blood of HCC. Our data show that alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in peripheral blood were significantly up-regulated in HCC patients before treatment when compared with healthy people and reduced after TACE combined with AHCS treatment (P < 0.01). In addition, we found that CD4+ cells and NK cells decreased (P < 0.05) and CD8+ cells increased (P < 0.05) in HCC patients when compared with healthy people. After treatment, the CD4+ cells, CD4+ / CD8+ ratio, and NK cells were dramatically increased in HCC patients (P < 0.05). In contrast, CD8+ cells were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). TACE combined with AHCS treatment significantly prolonged 1- year survival rate of HCC patients and did not show significant side effects. Taken together, our data indicate that TACE combined with AHCS treatment improves patients ' immune system. It is a feasible and effective therapeutic method for HCC patients.",
  "27266283": "The sensitivity and specifity of DR-70 immunoassay as a tumor marker for non-small cell lung cancer Lung cancer is the most important causes of the cancer related mortality. Patients with lung cancer are usually diagnosed at advanced or locally advanced stage, for this reason early diagnosis of lung cancer is very important. For early detection of lung cancer some methods are emphasized such as low-dose computed tomography or tumor biomarkers. In this study we aimed to evaluate DR-70 sensitivity and specificity as a tumor marker in detection of non-small cell lung cancers. Between May 2013 and April 2014, the serum samples from 88 non lung cancer patients, 86 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disesase were obtained. Blood samples from each participant were analyzed for DR-70 level. Totally 174 patients were enrolled to the study (152 male, 22 female). Histopathologically 47(53.4%) patients were diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer, 34 (38.6%) with adenocarcinoma, and 7 (8%) with non-small cell lung cancer. The mean serum DR-70 levels in lung cancer patients (2.43 ± 1.82 µg/mL) was significantly higher compared to the 86 non-cancerous subjects (1.15 ± 0.70 µg/mL) (p< 0.01). DR-70 exhibited clinical sensitivity and specificity of 54.5 and 83.7%, respectively, at an optimal cut off at 1.98 µg/mL. It could be said that the risk of the presence of the disease is 6.171 times higher in the cases where DR-70 level is 1.98 µg/mL and higher. DR-70, a marker used to measure fibrin degradation products, generated by all major cancers, may helps to find high risk lung cancer patients.",
  "27270311": "Direct contact with perivascular tumor cells enhances integrin αvβ3 signaling and migration of endothelial cells The secretion of soluble pro-angiogenic factors by tumor cells and stromal cells in the perivascular niche promotes the aggressive angiogenesis that is typical of glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we show that angiogenesis also can be promoted by a direct interaction between brain tumor cells, including tumor cells with cancer stem -like properties (CSCs), and endothelial cells (ECs). As shown in vitro, this direct interaction is mediated by binding of integrin αvβ3 expressed on ECs to the RGD-peptide in L1CAM expressed on CSCs. It promotes both EC network formation and enhances directed migration toward basic fibroblast growth factor. Activation of αvβ3 and bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome X (BMX) is required for migration stimulated by direct binding but not for migration stimulated by soluble factors. RGD-peptide treatment of mice with established intracerebral GBM xenografts significantly reduced the percentage of Sox2 -positive tumor cells and CSCs in close proximity to ECs, decreased integrin αvβ3 and BMX activation and p130CAS phosphorylation in the ECs, and reduced the vessel surface area. These results reveal a previously unrecognized aspect of the regulation of angiogenesis in GBM that can impact therapeutic anti-angiogenic targeting.",
  "27240437": "Cognitive impairment in HIV and HCV co-infected patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis Cognitive impairment has been well documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infections. However, in the context of HIV / HCV co-infection the research is more limited. The aim of this systematic review was to describe the characteristics of cognitive impairment in HIV / HCV co-infection and to examine the differences in cognitive performance between HIV / HCV and HIV and HCV mono-infected patients. Of the 437 records initially screened, 24 papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Four studies were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies indicated that HIV / HCV co-infected patients had a higher level of cognitive impairment than HIV mono-infected patients. Meta-analysis also indicated that HIV mono-infected patients had a significantly lower global deficit score than co-infected patients. The results also indicated that co-infected patients were more likely to be impaired in information processing speed than HIV mono-infected patients. These findings can be challenged by biasing factors such as the small number of included studies, heterogeneity of the samples and a large diversity of methodological procedures. Future research with consistent and comprehensive neuropsychological batteries and covering a greater diversity of risk factors is needed, in order to clarify the effects of both viruses on cognitive function and the mechanisms that underlie these effects. Because cognitive impairments may pose significant challenges to medication adherence, quality of life and overall functioning, such knowledge may have important implications to the planning and implementation of effective interventions aimed at optimising the clinical management of these infections.",
  "27252199": "Morphological characteristics regulating phallic glans engorgement in the American alligator The distal part of the crocodilian phallus consists of a bulbous glans containing well-developed vascular tissues that can inflate before or during sexual activity, enlarging and elaborating the glans into a complex, though still functionally undefined, copulatory structure. An enlarged glans putatively interacts with the female cloaca and may change the shape of her reproductive tract to facilitate insemination and increase the probability of fertilization. Here, we investigated the cellular-level properties of the glans and other inflatable phallic tissues associated with the sperm -conducting sulcus spermaticus in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). Using histochemical staining, we visualized and defined collagen and elastin fiber densities and orientations in these tissues. Extracellular matrix architectures provided insights about phallic glans material properties and how they may affect tissue strength and flexibility during inflation and in response to copulatory forces. We also investigated the potential sources of fluids that induce inflation in alligator phalli. Combining serial sectioning and three-dimensional reconstruction, we identified a pair of supracrucal plexus vascular bodies at the proximal end of the alligator phallus that extend distally adjacent to ventro-medial sulcus tissues. Together, our gross and histological examination of the American alligator phallic glans suggests that its tissues are arranged in a manner that would allow vascular inflation to expand the glans to a specific and repeatable shape, and potentially release secretory products into the female reproductive tract. Both elements could play roles in postcopulatory sexual selection, by mechanically and/or chemically affecting female reproductive physiology.",
  "27233466": "Acute risk factors for suicide attempts and death: prospective findings from the STEP - BD study Suicide is unfortunately common in psychiatric practice, but difficult to predict. The present study sought to assess which clinical symptoms increase in the months before suicidal behavior in a sample of psychiatric outpatients with bipolar disorder. Data from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP - BD) trial were used. A total of 103 participants who attempted suicide or died by suicide during the trial were included; a 15% random sample of the remaining participants (n = 427) was used as a comparison sample. Linear mixed models in the six months before suicidal behavior were conducted for each of five proposed acute risk factors for suicidal behavior. Participants were assessed using the Clinical Monitoring Form (CMF) at each visit for the following potential acute risk factors for suicidal behavior: suicidal ideation, loss of interest, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, and high-risk behavior. Each of the five symptoms was elevated overall in individuals who engaged in suicidal behavior (p < 0.05). The severity of both suicidal ideation and loss of interest significantly increased in the months before suicidal behavior (p < 0.001). Anxiety demonstrated comparable effect sizes across multiple models. Psychomotor agitation and high-risk behavior were not significantly elevated before suicidal behavior. Suicidal ideation, loss of interest and, to a lesser extent, anxiety may represent acute suicide risk factors up to four months before suicidal behavior in outpatients with bipolar disorder. Further investigation of these potential acute risk factors in prospective analyses is warranted.",

A total of 16,890 reports of clinically obtained chest CT (06/2011 to 11/2014, single-centre) were searched describing an SSN. Subjects with a visually confirmed SSN and at least two thin-slice CTs were included. Nodule volumes were measured. Progression was defined as volume increase exceeding the software interscan variation. Nodule morphology, location, and patient characteristics were evaluated. Fifteen transient and 74 persistent SSNs were included (median follow-up 19.6 [8.3-36.8] months). Subjects with an SSN were slightly older than those without (62 vs. 58 years; p = 0.01), but no gender predilection was found. SSNs were mostly located in the upper lobes. Women showed significantly more often persistent lesions than men (94 % vs. 69 %; p = 0.002). Part-solid lesions were larger (1638 vs. 383 mm(3); p < 0.001) and more often progressive (68 % vs. 38 %; p = 0.02), compared to pure ground-glass nodules. Progressive SSNs were rare under the age of 50 years. Logistic regression analysis did not identify additional nodule parameters of future progression, apart from part-solid nature. This study confirms previously reported characteristics of SSNs and associated factors in a European, routine clinical population. • SSNs in women are significantly more often persistent compared to men. • SSN persistence is not associated with age or prior malignancy. • The majority of (persistent) SSNs are located in the upper lung lobes. • A part-solid nature is associated with future nodule growth. • Progressive solitary SSNs are rare under the age of 50 years.",

Study of two retrospective cohorts (Belgium, n=23,607; Spain, n=44,385) of 50-60 year old male employees with 4 years of follow-up. Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using Poisson regression models. Mortality for subjects with permanent disability was higher than for the employed, for both Belgium [MRR =4.56 (95% CI: 2.88-7.21)] and Spain [MRR =7.15 (95% CI: 5.37-9.51)]. For the unemployed / early retirees, mortality was higher in Spain [MRR =1.64 (95% CI: 1.24-2.17)] than in Belgium [MRR =0.88 (95% CI: 0.46-1.71)]. MRR differences between Belgium and Spain for unemployed workers could be partly explained because of differences between the two social security systems. Future studies should further explore mortality differences between countries with different social security systems.",
  "27235870": "Neurotrophins and specific receptors in the oviduct tracts of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) Neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF and NT-3) and their specific receptors (TrkA, TrkB and TrkC) were studied in the oviduct of egg laying quails. Neurotrophins (NTs) are mainly involved in the development and maintenance of neuronal populations in the central and peripheral nervous system, but also in reproductive system. In this survey, we first studied the morphological organization of the quail oviduct, distinguished in infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, uterus and vagina, and then we analyzed the expression and localization of NTs and Trks receptors in the whole tracts. By western blotting we detected that the investigated NTs and Trks receptors are expressed in all oviductal tracts. By immunohistochemistry we were able to define the distribution of NTs and Trks. Specifically, NGF, BDNF and NT3 were localized in lining and ductal epithelial cells, and NGF was also detected in secretory cells of tubular glands and in nervous fibers of vessel wall. TrkA and TrkB were present in the lining and ductal epithelium; TrkA and TrkC were present in nervous fibers of vessel wall in all oviductal tracts. Furthermore, we also observed NGF and BDNF co-localized with TrkA and TrkB in cells of the lining and ductal epithelium, suggesting an autocrine mechanism of action.",
  "27250793": "Intracellular Metabolism of α,β-Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds, Acrolein, Crotonaldehyde and Methyl Vinyl Ketone, Active Toxicants in Cigarette Smoke: Participation of Glutathione Conjugation Ability and Aldehyde-Ketone Sensitive Reductase Activity The major toxicants in cigarette smoke, α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, such as acrolein (ACR) and crotonaldehyde (CA), and α,β-unsaturated ketone, methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), are known to form Michael-type adducts with glutathione (GSH) and consequently cause intracellular GSH depletion, which is involved in cigarette smoke - induced cytotoxicity. We have previously clarified that exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) of a mouse melanoma cell culture medium causes rapid reduction of intracellular GSH levels, and that the GSH - MVK adduct can be detected by LC/MS analysis while the GSH - CA adduct is hardly detected. In the present study, to clarify why the GSH - CA adduct is difficult to detect in the cell medium, we conducted detailed investigation of the structures of the reaction products of ACR, CA, MVK and CSE in the GSH solution or the cell culture medium. The mass spectra indicated that in the presence of the cells, the GSH - CA and GSH - ACR adducts were almost not detected while their corresponding alcohols were detected. On the other hand, both the GSH - MVK adducts and their reduced products were detected. In the absence of the cells, the reaction of GSH with all α,β-unsaturated carbonyls produced only their corresponding adducts. These results show that the GSH adducts of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, CA and ACR, are quickly reduced by certain intracellular carbonyl reductase(s) and excreted from the cells, unlike the GSH adduct of α,β-unsaturated ketone, MVK. Such a difference in reactivity to the carbonyl reductase might be related to differences in the cytotoxicity of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones.",
  "27287247": "Inflamed skin predisposes to sensitization to less potent allergens Irritant dermatitis, caused by genetic barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis or wet work in hand dermatitis, induces innate immune response that might predispose to allergic contact sensitization to less potent sensitizers. We sought to determine if positive patch test results to less potent allergens are more prevalent in patients with a history of childhood flexural dermatitis or current wet work. We examined our database of patients presenting to a contact dermatitis clinic tested to potential contact allergens as indicated by their history. Allergens from our most recent standard were studied if they could be classified as weak, moderate, or strong sensitizers based on published data from the local lymph node assay. Patients were stratified by a history of childhood - onset flexural dermatitis as a proxy for atopic dermatitis and by occupation. History of childhood - onset dermatitis predisposed to contact allergy to weak sensitizers and wet work to medium - potency sensitizers. Neither predisposed to contact allergy from strong sensitizers. Association cannot prove causation. We conclude that strong sensitizers do not require wet work or atopy to cause sensitization. Barrier defects associated with childhood eczema and wet work may promote sensitization to weak antigens.",
  "27251364": "Wild food plants and fungi used in the mycophilous Tibetan community of Zhagana (Tewo County, Gansu, China) The aim of the study was to investigate knowledge and use of wild food plants and fungi in a highland valley in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region on the north-eastern edges of the Tibetan Plateau. Field research was carried out in four neighbouring villages in a mountain valley of the Diebu (Tewo) county, surrounded by spruce forests. The study consisted of 30 interviews with single informants, or group interviews (altogether 63 informants). Apart from collecting voucher specimens, we also identified fungi using DNA barcoding. We recorded the use of 54 species of vascular plants. We also recorded the use of 22 mushroom taxa, which made up the largest category of wild foods. Fruits formed the largest category of food plants, with 21 species, larger than the wild greens category, which consisted of 20 species eaten after boiling or frying and 7 as raw snacks. We also recorded the alimentary use of 10 species of edible flowers and 3 species with underground edible organs. On average, 20.8 edible taxa were listed per interview (median - 21). The most listed category of wild foods was green vegetables (mean - 7.5 species, median - 8 species), but fruits and mushrooms were listed nearly as frequently (mean - 6.3, median - 6 and mean - 5.8, - median 6 respectively). Other category lists were very short, e.g., flowers (mean - 1.3, median - 1) and underground edible parts (mean - 0.7, median - 1). Wild vegetables are usually boiled and/or fried and served as side-dishes, or their green parts are eaten as snacks during mountain treks (e.g., peeled rhubarb shoots). Wild fruits are mainly collected by children and eaten raw, they are not stored for further use. The most widely used wild staple foods are Potetilla anserina roots, an important ceremonial food served on such occasions as New Year or at funerals. They are boiled and served with sugar and butter. The most important famine plants remembered by people are the aerial bulbils of Persicaria vivipara. Flowers are used as children's snacks - their nectar is sucked. The number of wild taxa eaten in the studied valley is similar to that of other Tibetan areas. The structure of wild food plant taxa is also very typical for Tibetan speaking areas (e.g., the use of rhubarb shoots, Potentilla anserina, Persicaria vivipara). The studied community show a high level of mycophilia.",
  "26876532": "EZH2 and ZFX oncogenes in malignant behaviour of parathyroid neoplasms Several studies reported somatic mutations of many genes (MEN1, CTNNB1, CDKIs and others) in parathyroid adenoma, although with different prevalence. Recently, activating mutations of the EZH2 and ZFX oncogenes were identified in benign parathyroid adenoma by whole exome sequencing. The same mutations had been found in blood and ovary malignant tumours. On one hand, this result raised the hypothesis that these oncogenes may play a role in the onset of parathyroid tumour, but it would also suggest they may be involved in malignant, rather benign, parathyroid neoplasm. Our aim was to verify the occurrence of selected mutations of the EZH2 and ZFX genes in an Italian cohort of 23 sporadic parathyroid carcinomas, 12 atypical and 45 typical adenomas. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, PCR amplified and directly sequenced. No mutations were detected in the coding sequence and boundaries of both genes in any of the samples. Two polymorphisms of the EZH2 gene were identified with different prevalence: the rs2072407 variant was present in the 30 % of the samples, in keeping with the overall frequency in larger populations, while the rs78589034 variant, located close to the 5' end of the exon 16, was detected in only one proband with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism; we investigated the possible outcome on the splicing process. EZH2 and ZFX genes do not seem to have an impact on the onset of most parathyroid tumours, both benign and malignant, though further studies on larger cohorts of different ethnicity are needed.",
  "27252099": "Comparison of Head Elevation Protocols Following Femoral Artery Sheath Removal After Coronary Angiography To compare 2 standard protocols for head elevation following removal of a femoral artery sheath after coronary angiography and their effects on bleeding complications and reported levels of back pain. One protocol involved flat supine bed rest; the other allowed progressive head elevation. A prospective comparative study of 80 adult patients undergoing coronary angiography via the femoral approach. The Numeric Rating Scale was used as the measure of reported pain. No bleeding complications occurred in either group. Both groups had very low mean pain scores. Repeated- measures analysis demonstrated that the experience of pain differed significantly over time by location (F5,70 = 3.864, P = .004), with a notable decrease in pain scores more than 1 hour after sheath removal at the location that used the progressive head elevation protocol. Patients ' satisfaction scores after discharge did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Patients with a history of chronic back pain had consistently higher pain scores, but those pain scores did not differ significantly by location (or protocol). It appears that using a progressive head - elevation protocol within the first 3 hours after diagnostic angiography is not associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications at the access site and warrants further exploration in the mitigation of back pain associated with prolonged supine bed rest.",
  "27274524": "Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis as a Rare Cause of Recurrent Epigastric Pain Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) is a rare inflammatory disorder of gastrointestinal tract characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the bowel wall. It can mimic many gastrointestinal disorders due to its wide spectrum of presentations. Diagnose is mostly based on excluding other disorders and a high suspicion. Here we report a case of 26 year old man with a history of sever epigastric pain followed by nausea, vomiting since a few days before admission with final diagnosis of EGE."
