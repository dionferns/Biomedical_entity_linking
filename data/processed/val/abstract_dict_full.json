Particularly, the reaction rate was enhanced using sodium salt 1a-c with a lipophilic substituent on the cyclopentadienide ring. From the results obtained by a triphasic experiment, hydrolysis proceeds via the formation of hydronium ion 2 in the aqueous phase by ion exchange, followed by the transfer of 2 to the CH2Cl2 phase.",
  "28494350": "Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification of acetamiprid and thiacloprid residues in butterbur grown under regulated conditions An analytical method was developed to quantify the residual levels of the neonicotinoid insecticides, acetamiprid and thiacloprid, in field-incurred butterbur samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Samples were extracted with acetonitrile and partitioned with dichloromethane. After partitioning, purification was conducted using a Florisil(®) cartridge. Linearity of a matrix-matched calibration curve of the two compounds over a concentration range of 0.004-0.4μg/g was excellent, with determination coefficients (R(2))≥0.9998. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for both acetamiprid and thiacloprid were 0.0006 and 0.002mg/kg, respectively. The average recoveries for acetamiprid and thiacloprid at two spiking levels (0.02 and 0.1mg/kg, i.e., 10× LOQ and 50× LOQ) were between 78.23 to 82.17%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs)≤7.22%. The method was successfully applied to field-incurred samples treated with a commercial pesticide product, either once (zero or 7 days before harvest) or twice (0 and 7, 7 and 14, or 14 and 21 days before harvest). The highest and lowest residues were obtained for the 7 and 0 days ' treatment and the 21 and 14 days ' treatment, respectively. The developed method is simple and accurate and can be extrapolated to other leafy vegetables.",

A questionnaire has been designed to evaluate the usage and utility of the HeartKeeper app. The questionnaire information was collected by collaborating cardiologists from 32 patients before and after they used the app. Patients were randomly selected with established quotas within interest groups, so that men and women, patients older or younger than 60 years old and patients living in urban or rural areas were equally represented. Using the appropriate statistical techniques we see that the HeartKeeper app was useful for patients as they qualify with 70 points (out of 100) the overall opinion of the app, it helps them remember more easily taking their pills with a mean improvement of 20.94 points (p < 0.001) and they perceive a global improvement of their health (8.28 points, p < 0.001). We also observe that these improvements do not depend, in general, on the area (urban or rural) where the patient comes from or on their sex. Although older patients needed more help to use the app and used it slightly less frequently, the improvements on several measures considered, such as remembering taking pills, breathing problems or trouble developing activities, depend significantly (p < 0.05) on age with older patients reporting higher improvements than younger ones. The results obtained with the sample of patients considered in this research prove the utility of the HeartKeeper app. This utility is similar in urban and rural areas and for patients of both sexes and, to some extent, depends on the age of the patient with older patients reporting slightly lower frequency of use but higher health improvements than younger ones.",
  "27233260": "Expression and Purification of E2 Glycoprotein from Insect Cells (Sf9) for Use in Serology Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito - borne arbovirus which poses a major threat to global public health. Definitive CHIKV diagnosis is crucial, especially in distinguishing the disease from dengue virus, which co-circulates in endemic areas and shares the same mosquito vectors. Laboratory diagnosis is mainly based on serological or molecular approaches. The E2 glycoprotein is a good candidate for serological diagnosis since it is the immunodominant antigen during the course of infection, and reacts with seropositive CHIKV sera. In this chapter, we describe the generation of stable clone Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells expressing secreted, soluble, and native recombinant CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. We use direct plasmid expression in insect cells, rather than the traditional technique of generating recombinant baculovirus. This recombinant protein is useful for serological diagnosis of CHIKV infection.",

Correct femoral tunnel position is thought to be crucial to successful MPFL reconstruction, but the accuracy of this statement in terms of patient outcomes has not been tested. To assess the accuracy of femoral tunnel placement in an MPFL reconstruction cohort and to determine the correlation between tunnel accuracy and a validated disease - specific, patient -reported quality-of-life outcome measure. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Between June 2008 and February 2014, a total of 206 subjects underwent an MPFL reconstruction. Lateral radiographs were measured to determine the accuracy of the femoral tunnel by measuring the distance from the center of the femoral tunnel to the Schöttle point. Banff Patella Instability Instrument (BPII) scores were collected a mean 24 months postoperatively. A total of 155 (79.5%) subjects had adequate postoperative lateral radiographs and complete BPII scores. The mean duration of follow-up (± SD) was 24.4 ± 8.2 months (range, 12-74 months). Measurement from the center of the femoral tunnel to the Schöttle point resulted in 143 (92.3%) tunnel s being categorized as \" good \" or \" ideal .\" There were 8 failures in the cohort, none of which occurred in malpositioned tunnels. The mean distance from the center of the MPFL tunnel to the center of the Schöttle point was 5.9 ± 4.2 mm (range, 0.5-25.9 mm). The mean postoperative BPII score was 65.2 ± 22.5 (range, 9.2-100). Pearson r correlation demonstrated no statistically significant relationship between accuracy of femoral tunnel position and BPII score (r = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.08). There was no evidence of a correlation between the accuracy of MPFL reconstruction femoral tunnel in relation to the Schöttle point and disease - specific quality-of-life scores. Graft failure was not related to femoral tunnel placement. The patellofemoral instability population is complex, and patients present with multiple risk factors that, in addition to the accuracy of femoral tunnel position, contribute to quality of life and warrant further investigation.",

  "27374165": "Early hippocampal volume loss as a marker of eventual memory deficits caused by repeated stress Exposure to severe and prolonged stress has detrimental effects on the hippocampus. However, relatively little is known about the gradual changes in hippocampal structure, and its behavioral consequences, over the course of repeated stress. Behavioral analyses during 10 days of chronic stress pointed to a delayed decline in spatial memory, the full impact of which is evident only after the end of stress. In contrast, concurrent volumetric measurements in the same animals revealed significant reduction in hippocampal volumes in stressed animals relative to their unstressed counterparts, as early as the third day of stress. Notably, animals that were behaviorally the worst affected at the end of chronic stress suffered the most pronounced early loss in hippocampal volume. Together, these findings support the view that not only is smaller hippocampal volume linked to stress - induced memory deficits, but it may also act as an early risk factor for the eventual development of cognitive impairments seen in stress-related psychiatric disorders.",
  "28538914": "The regulation and adoption of health technologies under Brazil's Unified Health System: barriers to access to medicines for diseases of poverty? The study aimed to examine the regulation and adoption of health technologies for the diseases of poverty in the Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS). An exploratory, descriptive study was conducted between January and May 2016 consisting of the search and analysis of relevant documents on the websites of Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the National Commission for the Adoption of Technologies by the SUS, and Saúde Legis (the Ministry of Health's Legislation System). The 2014 version of the Brazilian National List of Essential Medicines (RENAME, acronym in Portuguese) contained 132 medicines for diseases of poverty. Over one-third of these (49) had only one national producer, while 24 were not registered in the country. The number of medicines contained in the RENAME dedicated to this group of diseases increased by 46% between 2006 and 2014. Despite advances in the regulation and incorporation of technologies by the SUS, given the lack of market interest and neglect of diseases of poverty, the government has a vital role to play in ensuring access to the best available therapies in order to reduce health inequalities. It therefore follows that Brazil needs to improve the regulation of medicines that do not attract market interest.",
  "27524208": "Doctor Competence and the Demand for Healthcare: Evidence from Rural China The agency problem between patients and doctors has long been emphasised in the health economics literature, but the empirical evidence on whether patients can evaluate and respond to better quality care remains mixed and inconclusive. Using household data linked to an assessment of village doctors' clinical competence in rural China, we show that there is no correlation between doctor competence and patients' healthcare utilisation, with confidence intervals reasonably tight around zero. Household perceptions of quality are an important determinant of care-seeking behaviour, yet patients appear unable to recognise more competent doctors - there is no relationship between doctor competence and perceptions of quality.

Predictive accuracy in women with previous cervical surgery (a potentially different risk mechanism) is not known. We sought to compare the predictive accuracy of cervicovaginal fluid quantitative fetal fibronectin and cervical length testing in asymptomatic women with previous cervical surgery to that in women with 1 previous preterm birth. We conducted a prospective blinded secondary analysis of a larger observational study of cervicovaginal fluid quantitative fetal fibronectin concentration in asymptomatic women measured with a Hologic 10Q system (Hologic, Marlborough, MA). Prediction of spontaneous preterm birth (<30, <34, and <37 weeks) with cervicovaginal fluid quantitative fetal fibronectin concentration in primiparous women who had undergone at least 1 invasive cervical procedure (n = 473) was compared with prediction in women who had previous spontaneous preterm birth, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, or late miscarriage (n = 821). Relationship with cervical length was explored. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks in the cervical surgery group was 3% compared with 9% in previous spontaneous preterm birth group. Receiver operating characteristic curves comparing quantitative fetal fibronectin for prediction at all 3 gestational end points were comparable between the cervical surgery and previous spontaneous preterm birth groups (34 weeks: area under the curve, 0.78 [95% confidence interval 0.64-0.93] vs 0.71 [95% confidence interval 0.64-0.78]; P = .39). Prediction of spontaneous preterm birth using cervical length compared with quantitative fetal fibronectin for prediction of preterm birth <34 weeks of gestation offered similar prediction (area under the curve, 0.88 [95% confidence interval 0.79-0.96] vs 0.77 [95% confidence interval 0.62-0.92], P = .12 in the cervical surgery group; and 0.77 [95% confidence interval 0.70-0.84] vs 0.74 [95% confidence interval 0.67-0.81], P = .32 in the previous spontaneous preterm birth group). Prediction of spontaneous preterm birth using cervicovaginal fluid quantitative fetal fibronectin in asymptomatic women with cervical surgery is valid, and has comparative accuracy to that in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.",
  "28364927": "Preliminary results from direct-to-facility vaccine deliveries in Kano, Nigeria As part of its vaccine supply chain redesign efforts, Kano state now pushes vaccines directly from 6 state stores to primary health centers equipped with solar refrigerators. Our objective is to describe preliminary results from the first 20 months of Kano's direct vaccine delivery operations. This is a retrospective review of Kano's direct vaccine delivery program. We analyzed trends in health facility vaccine stock levels, and examined the relationship between stock-out rates and each of cascade vaccine deliveries and timeliness of deliveries. Analysis of vaccination trends was based on administrative data from 27 sentinel health facilities. Costs for both the in-sourced and out-sourced approaches were estimated using a bottoms-up model-based approach. Overall stock adequacy increased from 54% in the first delivery cycle to 68% by cycle 33. Conversely, stock-out rates decreased from 41% to 10% over the same period. Similar trends were observed in the out-sourced and in-sourced programs. Stock-out rates rose incrementally with increasing number of cascade facilities, and delays in vaccine deliveries correlated strongly with stock-out rates. Recognizing that stock availability is one of many factors contributing to vaccinations, we nonetheless compared pre - and post - direct deliveries vaccinations in sentinel facilities, and found statistically significant upward trends for 4 out of 6 antigens. 1 antigen (measles) showed an upward trend that was not statistically significant. Hepatitis b vaccinations declined during the period. Overall, there appeared to be a one- year lag between commencement of direct deliveries and the increase in number of vaccinations. Weighted average cost per delivery is US$29.8 and cost per child immunized is US$0.7 per year. Direct vaccine delivery to health facilities in Kano, through a streamlined architecture, has resulted in decreased stock-outs and improved stock adequacy. Concurrent operation of insourced and outsourced programs has enabled Kano build in-house logistics capabilities.",

We provide here an up-to-date perspective on the potential use of LDL particle number and size as complementary risk factors to predict and manage cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the clinical realm. Studies show that a significant proportion of the population has discordant LDL particle number and cholesterol indices [non-HDL cholesterol (HDL-C)]. Data also show that risk prediction may be improved when using information on LDL particle number in patients with discordant particle number and cholesterol data. Yet, most of the current CVD guidelines conclude that LDL particle number is not superior to cholesterol indices, including non-HDL-C concentrations, in predicting CVD risk. LDL particle size, on the other hand, has not been independently associated with CVD risk after adjustment for other risk factors such as LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-C and that routine use of information pertaining to particle size to determine and manage patients' risk is not yet justified. Additional studies are required to settle the debate on which of cholesterol indices and LDL particle number is the best predictor of CVD risk, and if such measures should be integrated in clinical practice.",
  "27447000": "Effect of endodontic access cavity preparation on monolithic and ceramic veneered zirconia restorations Due to the high chipping rates observed in veneered zirconia ceramic restorations, the use of monolithic zirconia restorations has been recommended. This study tried to compare veneered and monolithic zirconia fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with respect to the amount of damage induced by endodontic access preparation. Monolithic and ceramic veneered (n = 10) three-unit restorations (retainers: first premolar and first molar; pontic: second premolar) were subject to endodontic access cavity preparation in both retainers using a diamond rotary instrument under continuous water cooling. The number of chipping fractures and microfractures detected using the fluorescent penetrant method were recorded. Statistical analysis was based on Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Bonferroni correction (level of significance α = .05). Only one microfracture could be identified in the group of monolithic FDPs while a maximum of seven microfractures and three chipping fractures per retainer crown were recorded in the group of veneered restorations. At the premolar site, the veneered restorations showed significantly more microfractures (P = .0055) and chipping fractures (P = .0008). At the molar site, no significant difference with respect to microfractures could be detected (P = .0767), while significantly more chipping fractures occurred in the veneered samples (P = .0293). Monolithic zirconia restorations seem to be less susceptible to damage when endodontic access cavities have to be prepared as compared to veneered zirconia reconstructions. However, no conclusions can be drawn on the longterm performance of a specific restoration based on this study.",
  "28112192": "STAC3 stably interacts through its C1 domain with CaV1.1 in skeletal muscle triads The adaptor protein STAC3 is essential for skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and a mutation in the STAC3 gene has been linked to a severe muscle disease, Native American myopathy (NAM). However the function of STAC3, its interaction partner, and the mode of interaction within the EC-coupling complex remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that STAC3 forms a stable interaction with the voltage-sensor of EC-coupling, CaV1.1, and that this interaction depends on a hitherto unidentified protein-protein binding pocket in the C1 domain of STAC3. While the NAM mutation does not affect the stability of the STAC3 - CaV1.1 interaction, mutation of two crucial residues in the C1 binding pocket increases the turnover of STAC3 in skeletal muscle triads. Thus, the C1 domain of STAC3 is responsible for its stable incorporation into the CaV1.1 complex, whereas the SH3 domain containing the NAM mutation site may be involved in low-affinity functional interactions in EC-coupling.",

The 4-anilinoquinazolines were evaluated for potential cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines, namely, human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells, human cervical cancer (HeLa) and human lung cancer (A549) cells. The most active compounds, 2b, 2c, 3c, 4a, 4c and 5a, were found to be more selective against the MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines than the human lung carcinoma (A549) cells. We selected compounds 2c, 3c and 7a as representatives for further evaluation for potential to induce apoptosis and/or necrotic properties in the three cancer cell lines. Compound 2c induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells through cell membrane alteration. Treatment of Hela and A549 cell lines with compounds 3c and 7a, respectively, led to caspase-3 activation in both cell lines. Compound 3c, on the other hand, caused more necrosis than apoptosis induction in the membrane alteration assay.",

However, late complications in adults with a repaired MMC are not well understood. In particular, the influence of a degenerative spinal deformity on a sustained tethered cord is still unclear. A 63-year-old man with a repaired MMC presented with a progressive gait disturbance and numbness in both lower limbs. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated that the tethered spinal cord was compressed by severe canal stenosis along the entire lumbar spine. After a multi-level lumbar decompression surgery, the patient recovered to baseline neurological status. In adults with a repaired MMC, lumbar canal stenosis should be investigated as a possible cause of late neurological decline. Clinical manifestations may be complicated by the coexistence of both the original and subsequent neurological disorders. Because these additional disorders result from compressive myelopathy, early surgical decompression is indicated to avoid irreversible spinal cord dysfunction.",

  "28071754": "Far-infrared protects vascular endothelial cells from advanced glycation end products - induced injury via PLZF -mediated autophagy in diabetic mice The accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in diabetic patients induces vascular endothelial injury. Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) is a transcription factor that can be activated by low-temperature far-infrared (FIR) irradiation to exert beneficial effects on the vascular endothelium. In the present study, we investigated the influence of FIR - induced PLZF activation on AGE - induced endothelial injury both in vitro and in vivo. FIR irradiation inhibited AGE - induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). PLZF activation increased the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K), which are important kinases in the autophagic signaling pathway. FIR - induced PLZF activation led to autophagy in HUVEC, which was mediated through the upregulation of PI3K. Immunofluorescence staining showed that AGEs were engulfed by HUVECs and localized to lysosomes. FIR - induced autophagy promoted AGEs degradation in HUVECs. In nicotinamide / streptozotocin - induced diabetic mice, FIR therapy reduced serum AGEs and AGEs deposition at the vascular endothelium. FIR therapy also reduced diabetes - induced inflammatory markers in the vascular endothelium and improved vascular endothelial function. These protective effects of FIR therapy were not found in PLZF - knockout mice. Our data suggest that FIR - induced PLZF activation in vascular endothelial cells protects the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice from AGE - induced injury.",
  "28549352": "Eye abduction reduces but does not eliminate competition in the oculomotor system Although it is well established that there is a tight coupling between covert attention and the eye movement system there is an ongoing controversy whether this relationship is functional. Previous studies demonstrated that disrupting the ability to execute an eye movement interferes with the allocation of covert attention. One technique that prevents the execution of an eye movement involves the abduction of the eye in the orbit while presenting the stimuli outside of the effective oculomotor range (Craighero, Nascimben, & Fadiga, 2004). Although eye abduction is supposed to disrupt activation of the oculomotor program responsible for the shift of covert attention, this crucial assumption has never been tested experimentally. In the present study we used saccadic curvature to examine whether eye abduction eliminates the target-distractor competition in the oculomotor system. We experimentally reduced the ability to execute saccades by abducting the eye by 30° (monocular vision). This way the peripheral part of the temporal hemifield was located outside the oculomotor range. Participants made a vertical eye movement while on some trials a distractor was shown either inside or outside of the oculomotor range. The curvature away from distractors located outside the oculomotor range was reduced, but not completely eliminated. This confirms that eye abduction influences the activation of the oculomotor program, but points to the fact that other forms of motor planning, such as head movements are also represented in the oculomotor system. The results are in line with the idea that covert attention is an emerging property of movement planning, but is not restricted to saccade planning.",

Yet, the growing worldwide popularity of another form of tobacco consumption, water pipe smoking, has received relatively less attention. To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has evaluated the effects of water pipe smoking on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activities and drug interaction potential in humans, whereas only limited information is available on the impact of secondhand smoke on drug metabolism. In a sample of 99 healthy volunteers (28 water pipe smokers, 30 secondhand tobacco smoke exposed persons, and 41 controls), we systematically compared CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 enzyme activities in vivo using caffeine urine test. The median self-reported duration of water pipe smoking was 7.5 h / week and 3 years of exposure in total. The secondhand smoke group had a median of 14 h of self-reported weekly exposure to tobacco smoke indoor where a minimum of five cigarettes were smoked / hour for a total of 3.5 years (median). Analysis of variance did not find a significant difference in CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 activities among the three study groups (p > 0.05). Nor was there a significant association between the extent of water pipe or secondhand smoke exposure and the CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 activities (p > 0.05). Further analysis in a subsample with smoke exposure more than the median values also did not reveal a significant difference from the controls. Although we do not rule out an appreciable possible impact of water pipe smoke and secondhand smoke on in vivo activities of these two drug metabolism pathways, variability in smoke constituents from different tobacco consumption methods (e.g., water pipe) might affect drug metabolism in ways that might differ from that of cigarette smoke. Further studies in larger prospective samples are recommended to evaluate water pipe and secondhand tobacco smoke effects on CYP450 function, particularly at higher smoke exposure conditions.",
  "28542952": "Compensatory and decompensatory alterations in cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) dynamics in hearts with diastolic dysfunction following aortic banding At the cellular level cardiac hypertrophy causes remodelling, leading to changes in ionic channel, pump and exchanger densities and kinetics. Previous studies have focused on quantifying changes in channels, pump s and exchangers without quantitatively linking these changes with emergent cellular scale functionality. Two biophysical cardiac cell models were created, parameterized and validated and are able to simulate electrophysiology and calcium dynamics in myocytes from control sham operated rats and aortic - banded rats exhibiting diastolic dysfunction. The contribution of each ionic pathway to the calcium kinetics was calculated, identifying the L-type Ca(2+) channel and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase as the principal regulators of systolic and diastolic Ca(2+), respectively. Results show that the ability to dynamically change systolic Ca(2+), through changes in expression of key Ca(2+) modelling protein densities, is drastically reduced following the aortic banding procedure; however the cells are able to compensate Ca(2+) homeostasis in an efficient way to minimize systolic dysfunction. Elevated left ventricular afterload leads to myocardial hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, cellular remodelling and compromised calcium dynamics. At the cellular scale this remodelling of the ionic channels, pumps and exchangers gives rise to changes in the Ca(2+) transient. However, the relative roles of the underlying subcellular processes and the positive or negative impact of each remodelling mechanism are not fully understood. Biophysical cardiac cell models were created to simulate electrophysiology and calcium dynamics in myocytes from control rats (SHAM) and aortic - banded rats exhibiting diastolic dysfunction. The model parameters and framework were validated and the fitted parameters demonstrated to be unique for explaining our experimental data. The contribution of each ionic pathway to the calcium kinetics was calculated, identifying the L-type Ca(2+) channel (LCC) and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) -ATPase (SERCA) as the principal regulators of systolic and diastolic Ca(2+), respectively. In the aortic banding model, the sensitivity of systolic Ca(2+) to LCC density and diastolic Ca(2+) to SERCA density decreased by 16-fold and increased by 23%, respectively, relative to the SHAM model. The energy cost of ionic homeostasis is maintained across the two models. The models predict that changes in ionic pathway densities in compensated aortic banding rats maintain Ca(2+) function and efficiency. The ability to dynamically alter systolic function is significantly diminished, while the capacity to maintain diastolic Ca(2+) is moderately increased.",
  "28261242": "Identification and Functional Characterization of a Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter in Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Acidity plays an important role in flavor and overall organoleptic quality of fruit and is mainly due to the presence of organic acids. Understanding the molecular basis of organic acid metabolism is thus of primary importance for fruit quality improvement. Here, we cloned a putative tonoplast dicarboxylate transporter gene (SlTDT) from tomato, and submitted it to the NCBI database (GenBank accession number: KC733165). SlTDT protein contained 13 putative transmembrane domains in silico analysis. Confocal microscopic study using green fluorescent fusion proteins revealed that SlTDT was localized on tonoplast. The expression patterns of SlTDT in tomato were analyzed by RT-qPCR. The results indicated that SlTDT expressed in leaves, roots, flowers and fruits at different ripening stages, suggesting SlTDT may be associated with the development of different tissues. To further explore the function of SlTDT, we constructed both overexpression and RNAi vectors and obtained transgenic tomato plants by agrobacterium -mediated method. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis showed that overexpression of SlTDT significantly increased malate content, and reduced citrate content in tomato fruit. By contrast, repression of SlTDT in tomato reduced malate content of and increased citrate content. These results indicated that SlTDT played an important role in remobilization of malate and citrate in fruit vacuoles.",

The source of these infections is often difficult to determine which complicates eradication efforts. Recently it has become apparent that the heater-cooler devices used in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass may become contaminated with bacteria that are normally found in hospital water sources. The culprit organisms are nontuberculous mycobacteria which coat the intrinsic surfaces found within the circuits of the heater-coolers. Aerosolization of the bacteria occurs during normal heater-cooler operation which can disperse the organisms throughout the operating room. The bacteria are slow-growing and may not present for months, or years, following exposure which makes epidemiological determination a challenge.

  "27765603": "Different microRNA alterations contribute to diverse outcomes following EV71 and CA16 infections: Insights from high-throughput sequencing in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are the predominant pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Although these viruses exhibit genetic homology, the clinical manifestations caused by the two viruses have some discrepancies. In addition, the underlying mechanisms leading to these differences remain unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in numerous biological or pathological processes, including host responses to viral infections. Here, we focused on differences in miRNA expression patterns in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with EV71 and CA16 at various time points using high-throughput sequencing. The results demonstrated that 106 known and 13 novel miRNAs exhibited significant differences, and 32 key miRNAs among them for target prediction presented opposite trends in the EV71 - and CA16 - infected samples. GO and pathway analysis of the predicted targets showed enrichment in 14 biological processes, 10 molecular functions, 8 cellular components and 104 pathways. Subsequently, regulatory networks of miRNA - transcription factors, miRNA - predicted targets, miRNA - GOs and miRNA - pathways were constructed to reveal the complex regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during the infection phase. Ultimately, we analysed hierarchical GO categories of the predicted targets involved in immune system processes, which indicated that the innate and adaptive immunity following EV71 and CA16 infections may be remarkably distinct. In conclusion, this report is the first describing miRNA expression profiles in PBMCs with EV71 and CA16 infections using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings could provide a valuable basis for further studies on the regulatory roles of miRNAs related to the different immune responses caused by EV71 and CA16 infections.",
  "27236097": "The influence of liposomal formulation on the incorporation and retention of PNA oligomers Liposomal formulations composed of phospholipids with different unsaturation degrees, head groups and at different cholesterol content have been tested for the encapsulation of Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) oligomers. The best loading capability (177μg, ER %=87.2) was obtained for pure liposomes of phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) with negatively charged head group. The insertion of a 10-20% of cholesterol in DOPG based liposomes provides a slight decrease (∼160μg) of the PNA loading. On the other hand, the cholesterol addition (20-30%) slows down the PNA's release (∼27%) in fetal bovine serum from the liposomal formulation. Based on the encapsulation and the release properties, PEGylated DOPG liposomes with a percentage of cholesterol of 10-20% are the optimal formulation for the loading of PNA-a210.",
  "28298224": "Transcriptional reprogramming in yeast using dCas9 and combinatorial gRNA strategies Transcriptional reprogramming is a fundamental process of living cells in order to adapt to environmental and endogenous cues. In order to allow flexible and timely control over gene expression without the interference of native gene expression machinery, a large number of studies have focused on developing synthetic biology tools for orthogonal control of transcription. Most recently, the nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) has emerged as a flexible tool for controlling activation and repression of target genes, by the simple RNA-guided positioning of dCas9 in the vicinity of the target gene transcription start site. In this study we compared two different systems of dCas9 -mediated transcriptional reprogramming, and applied them to genes controlling two biosynthetic pathways for biobased production of isoprenoids and triacylglycerols (TAGs) in baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By testing 101 guide-RNA (gRNA) structures on a total of 14 different yeast promoters, we identified the best-performing combinations based on reporter assays. Though a larger number of gRNA - promoter combinations do not perturb gene expression, some gRNAs support expression perturbations up to ~threefold. The best-performing gRNAs were used for single and multiplex reprogramming strategies for redirecting flux related to isoprenoid production and optimization of TAG profiles. From these studies, we identified both constitutive and inducible multiplex reprogramming strategies enabling significant changes in isoprenoid production and increases in TAG. Taken together, we show similar performance for a constitutive and an inducible dCas9 approach, and identify multiplex gRNA designs that can significantly perturb isoprenoid production and TAG profiles in yeast without editing the genomic context of the target genes. We also identify a large number of gRNA positions in 14 native yeast target pomoters that do not affect expression, suggesting the need for further optimization of gRNA design tools and dCas9 engineering.",
  "28198592": "Bone Marrow -Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells -Derived Exosomes Promote Survival of Retinal Ganglion Cells Through miRNA -Dependent Mechanisms The loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and their axons is one of the leading causes of blindness and includes traumatic (optic neuropathy) and degenerative (glaucoma) eye diseases. Although no clinical therapies are in use, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have demonstrated significant neuroprotective and axogenic effects on RGC in both of the aforementioned models. Recent evidence has shown that MSC secrete exosomes, membrane enclosed vesicles (30-100 nm) containing proteins, mRNA and miRNA which can be delivered to nearby cells. The present study aimed to isolate exosomes from bone marrow -derived MSC (BMSC) and test them in a rat optic nerve crush (ONC) model. Treatment of primary retinal cultures with BMSC - exosomes demonstrated significant neuroprotective and neuritogenic effects. Twenty-one days after ONC and weekly intravitreal exosome injections; optical coherence tomography, electroretinography, and immunohistochemistry was performed. BMSC -derived exosomes promoted statistically significant survival of RGC and regeneration of their axons while partially preventing RGC axonal loss and RGC dysfunction. Exosomes successfully delivered their cargo into inner retinal layers and the effects were reliant on miRNA, demonstrated by the diminished therapeutic effects of exosomes derived from BMSC after knockdown of Argonaute-2, a key miRNA effector molecule. This study supports the use of BMSC -derived exosomes as a cell-free therapy for traumatic and degenerative ocular disease. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:1273-1285.",

The goal of our study was to determine the correlation between lipid parameters, BMI and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The study was carried out by matched type between experimental group and controls. The experimental group consisted of 100 females at postmenopausal age, in which by the DEXA method was diagnosed osteoporosis at the Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, University Medical Center of RS during 2015-2016, while the control group consisted of 100 females in a postmenopausal age but without diagnosed osteoporosis. The groups were matched by age (± 2 years). To all participants of the study were carried out biochemical analysis of blood, or the analysis of the lipid profile that included total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides (TG) and HDL cholesterol, and was determined the values of BMI and waist circumference (WC). Analysis of the data of our research shows that by the univariate logistic regression the values of lipid parameters total cholesterol (p=0.000), LDL (p=0.005) and TG (p=0.033) were significantly associated with osteoporosis, while in multivariate logistic model only total cholesterol (p= 0.018) was found as an independent risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. BMI values were not statistically significantly associated with osteoporosis (p=0.727). On the decrease in bone mineral density and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women influence many risk factors whose identification has the aim to develop more effective prevention of this disease in the elderly.",
  "27823893": "Sepsis Clinical Criteria in Emergency Department Patients Admitted to an Intensive Care Unit: An External Validation Study of Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) is a prognostic score for patients with sepsis. Our aim was to compare the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of qSOFA vs. systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS) in predicting in-hospital mortality among emergency department (ED) patients with suspected infection admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). We conducted a retrospective cohort chart review study of ED patients admitted to an ICU with suspected infection from August 1, 2012 to February 28, 2015. We included all patients with body fluid cultures sampled either during their ED stay without antibiotic administration or within 24 h of antibiotics administered in the ED. Trained chart abstractors blinded to the study hypothesis double-entered data from each patient's electronic medical record including demographic characteristics, vital signs, laboratory study results, physical examination findings, and in-hospital mortality. We then calculated the AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for qSOFA and SIRS for predicting in-hospital mortality. Of 214 patients admitted to an ICU with presumed sepsis, 39 (18.2%) died during hospitalization. The AUROC value was 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.74) for SIRS vs. 0.66 (95% CI 0.57-0.76) for qSOFA; 2+ qSOFA criteria predicted in-hospital mortality with 89.7% sensitivity, 27.4% specificity, 1.2 positive likelihood ratio, and 0.4 negative likelihood ratio. Among ED patients admitted to an ICU, the SIRS and qSOFA criteria had comparable prognostic value for predicting in-hospital mortality. These prognostic values are similar to those reported by the Sepsis-3 guidelines for ICU encounters.",
  "27742373": "Scutellarin attenuates vasospasm through the Erk5 - KLF2 - eNOS pathway after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats Angiographic vasospasm, especially in the early phases (<72h) of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), is one of the major complications after an aneurysm rupture and is often the cause of delayed neurological deterioration. Scutellarin (SCU), a flavonoid extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Erigeron breviscapus, has been widely accepted as an antioxidant, but the effect of SCU on vasospasm after SAH remains elusive. Endovascular perforation was conducted to induce SAH in Sprague-Dawley rats. Then, the underlying mechanism of the anti-vasospasm effect of SCU was investigated using a modified Garcia scale, India ink angiography, cross-sectional area analysis, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot. SCU (50μM, 100mg/kg) alleviated angiographic vasospasm and improved neurological function 48h after SAH and enhanced the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) at the intima of cerebral arteries. In addition, SCU upregulated the expression of phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase 5 (p-Erk5) and Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) at 48h after SAH. However, the effects of SCU were reversed by the Erk5 inhibitor XMD8-92. Our results indicate that SCU could attenuate vasospasm and neurological deficits via modulating the Erk5 - KLF2 - eNOS pathway after SAH, which may provide an experimental basis for the clinical use of SCU treatment in SAH patients.",

  "27287247": "Inflamed skin predisposes to sensitization to less potent allergens Irritant dermatitis, caused by genetic barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis or wet work in hand dermatitis, induces innate immune response that might predispose to allergic contact sensitization to less potent sensitizers. We sought to determine if positive patch test results to less potent allergens are more prevalent in patients with a history of childhood flexural dermatitis or current wet work. We examined our database of patients presenting to a contact dermatitis clinic tested to potential contact allergens as indicated by their history. Allergens from our most recent standard were studied if they could be classified as weak, moderate, or strong sensitizers based on published data from the local lymph node assay. Patients were stratified by a history of childhood - onset flexural dermatitis as a proxy for atopic dermatitis and by occupation. History of childhood - onset dermatitis predisposed to contact allergy to weak sensitizers and wet work to medium - potency sensitizers. Neither predisposed to contact allergy from strong sensitizers. Association cannot prove causation. We conclude that strong sensitizers do not require wet work or atopy to cause sensitization. Barrier defects associated with childhood eczema and wet work may promote sensitization to weak antigens.",
  "28159606": "Recent coating developments for combination devices in orthopedic and dental applications: A literature review Orthopedic and dental implants have been used successfully for decades to replace or repair missing or damaged bones, joints, and teeth, thereby restoring patient function subsequent to disease or injury. However, although device success rates are generally high, patient outcomes are sometimes compromised due to device -related problems such as insufficient integration, local tissue inflammation, and infection. Many different types of surface coatings have been developed to address these shortcomings, including those that incorporate therapeutic agents to provide localized delivery to the surgical site. While these coatings hold enormous potential for improving device function, the list of requirements that an ideal combination coating must fulfill is extensive, and no single coating system today simultaneously addresses all of the criteria. Some of the primary challenges related to current coatings are non-optimal release kinetics, which most often are too rapid, the potential for inducing antibiotic resistance in target organisms, high susceptibility to mechanical abrasion and delamination, toxicity, difficult and expensive regulatory approval pathways, and high manufacturing costs. This review provides a survey of the most recent developments in the field, i.e., those published in the last 2-3years, with a particular focus on technologies that have potential for overcoming the most significant challenges facing therapeutically - loaded coatings. It is concluded that the ideal coating remains an unrealized target, but that advances in the field and emerging technologies are bringing it closer to reality. The significant amount of research currentl y being conducted in the field provides a level of optimism that many functional combination coating s will ultimately transition into clinical practice, significant ly improving patient outcomes.",
  "28434980": "Thaw -and-use target cells pre-labeled with calcein AM for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays In vitro antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays are routinely performed to support the research and development of therapeutic antibodies. In ADCC assays, target cells bound by the antibodies are lysed by activated effector cells following interactions between the Fc region of the bound antibody and Fcγ receptors on effector cells. Target cell lysis is typically measured by quantification of released endogenous enzymes, e.g., lactate dehydrogenase, or measurement of released exogenous labels, e.g., (51)Cr, europium or calcein. ADCC assays based on the detection of exogenous labels released from lysed target cells generally show higher sensitivity and require shorter incubation times. However, target cells are usually labeled immediately prior to assay, which inadvertently introduces additional assay variations due to differences in target cell conditions and labeling / handling processes. In this report, we describe the use of thaw -and-use pre-labeled target cells for ADCC assays. Thaw -and-use target cells in our experiments were pre-labeled with the fluorescent dye calcein AM, cryopreserved in single-use aliquots and used directly in assays after thawing. Upon thaw, the pre-labeled cells displayed viability and label retention comparable to freshly labeled cells, responded to ADCC mediated by both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and engineered natural killer cells, performed stably for at least 3 years and provided favorable precision and accuracy to ADCC assays. Implementation of thaw -and-use pre-labeled target cells in ADCC assays can help to alleviate both cell culture and dye labeling derived variability, increase the flexibility of assay scheduling and improve assay consistency and robustness.",
  "28051306": "H2O2 -Responsive Vesicles Integrated with Transcutaneous Patches for Glucose -Mediated Insulin Delivery A self-regulated \"smart\" insulin administration system would be highly desirable for diabetes management. Here, a glucose -responsive insulin delivery device, which integrates H2O2 -responsive polymeric vesicles (PVs) with a transcutaneous microneedle -array patch was prepared to achieve a fast response, excellent biocompatibility, and painless administration. The PVs are self-assembled from block copolymer incorporated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and phenylboronic ester (PBE)- conjugated polyserine (designated mPEG-b-P(Ser-PBE)) and loaded with glucose oxidase (GOx) and insulin. The polymeric vesicles function as both moieties of the glucose sensing element (GOx) and the insulin release actuator to provide basal insulin release as well as promote insulin release in response to hyperglycemic states. In the current study, insulin release responds quickly to elevated glucose and its kinetics can be modulated by adjusting the concentration of GOx loaded into the microneedles. In vivo testing indicates that a single patch can regulate glucose levels effectively with reduced risk of hypoglycemia.",

Using administrative data, we aimed to examine population-level trends in SCD, stratified by sex, age and prior CVD hospitalisation. Person-linked mortality and hospital morbidity data were used to identify SCD and determine hospitalisation and comorbidity using a 10-year hospitalisation lookback period. Log-linear Poisson regression was used to calculate annual rate changes and rate ratios. In Western Australia, 7160 SCD cases were identified from 1997 to 2010 with males comprising 69%. Overall age-standardised SCD rates decreased by 17% in men and 31% in women from 1997-2001 to 2007-2010. The annual rate reduction was higher in women than men (-4.0%/year versus -2.3%/year; p=0.0039). Significant reductions were observed for 55-69 year-old and 70-84 year-old men and women but not for the 35-54 year-olds. The overall relative risk comparing men to women increased slightly from 2.4 in 1997 to 3.0 in 2010 (trend p=0.0039) but differed across age groups. The relative risk declined in 35-54 year-olds from 5.1 to 3.2 whereas it increased from 2.9 to 3.9 in 55-69 year-olds and 1.9 to 2.3 in 70-84 year-olds. Declining trends in SCD rates were observed in those with and without prior CVD and were similar to CVD mortality trends (-4.9%/year in men and -5.5%/year in women). Trends in rates of SCD fell in middle to older aged men and women, with and without CVD, and mirrored the fall in fatal CVD. Limited improvement in 35-54 year-olds requires further investigation.",
  "28331599": "Species distribution modeling and molecular markers suggest longitudinal range shifts and cryptic northern refugia of the typical calcareous grassland species Hippocrepis comosa (horseshoe vetch) Calcareous grasslands belong to the most diverse, endangered habitats in Europe, but there is still insufficient information about the origin of the plant species related to these grasslands. In order to illuminate this question, we chose for our study the representative grassland species Hippocrepis comosa (Horseshoe vetch). Based on species distribution modeling and molecular markers, we identified the glacial refugia and the postglacial migration routes of the species to Central Europe. We clearly demonstrate that H. comosa followed a latitudinal and due to its oceanity also a longitudinal gradient during the last glacial maximum (LGM), restricting the species to southern refugia situated on the Peninsulas of Iberia, the Balkans, and Italy during the last glaciation. However, we also found evidence for cryptic northern refugia in the UK, the Alps, and Central Germany. Both species distribution modeling and molecular markers underline that refugia of temperate, oceanic species such as H. comosa must not be exclusively located in southern but also in western of parts of Europe. The analysis showed a distinct separation of the southern refugia into a western cluster embracing Iberia and an eastern group including the Balkans and Italy, which determined the postglacial recolonization of Central Europe. At the end of the LGM, H. comosa seems to have expanded from the Iberian refugium, to Central and Northern Europe, including the UK, Belgium, and Germany.",
  "27671016": "Size effect of Au / PAMAM contrast agent on CT imaging of reticuloendothelial system and tumor tissue Polyamidoamine (PAMAM)-entrapped Au nanoparticles were synthesized with distinct sizes to figure out the size effect of Au -based contrast agent on CT imaging of passively targeted tissues. Au / PAMAM nanoparticles were first synthesized with narrow distribution of particles size of 22.2 ± 3.1, 54.2 ± 3.7, and 104.9 ± 4.7 nm in diameters. Size effect leads no significant difference on X-ray attenuation when Au / PAMAM was ≤0.05 mol/L. For CT imaging of a tumor model, small Au / PAMAM were more easily internalized via endocytosis in the liver, leading to more obviously enhanced contrast. Similarly, contrast agents with small sizes were more effective in tumor imaging because of the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Overall, the particle size of Au / PAMAM heavily affected the efficiency of CT enhancement in imaging RES and tumors.",
  "28334784": "Testing the Ret and Sema3d genetic interaction in mouse enteric nervous system development For most multigenic disorders, clinical manifestation (penetrance) and presentation (expressivity) are likely to be an outcome of genetic interaction between multiple susceptibility genes. Here, using gene knockouts in mice we evaluated genetic interaction between loss of Ret and loss of Sema3d, two Hirschsprung disease susceptibility genes. We intercrossed Ret and Sema3d double null heterozygotes to generate mice with the nine possible genotypes and assessed survival by counting various genotypes, myenteric plexus presence by acetylcholinesterase staining and embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) intestine transcriptome by RNA-sequencing. Survival rates of Ret wildtype, null heterozygote and null homozygote mice at E12.5, birth and weaning were not influenced by the genotypes at Sema3d locus and vice-versa. Loss of myenteric plexus was observed only in all Ret null homozygotes, irrespective of the genotypes at Sema3d locus, and Sema3d null heterozygote and homozygote mice had normal intestinal innervation. As compared to wildtype mice intestinal gene expression, loss of Ret in null homozygotes led to differential expression of ∼300 genes, whereas loss of Sema3d in null homozygotes had no major consequence and there was no evidence supporting major interaction between the two genes influencing intestine transcriptome. Overall, given the null alleles and phenotypic assays used, we did not find evidence for genetic interaction between Ret and Sema3d affecting survival, presence of myenteric plexus or intestine transcriptome.",

A total of 14 attending paediatricians and paediatric residents participated in two focus group sessions. Data were analysed using Atlas.ti 5.0. In general, physicians reported positive experiences regarding the interaction between hospital clowns and paediatric patients on the ward. Physicians were more interested in research on children's perception of hospital clowns than in research on the clinical efficacy of hospital clowning. No direct collaboration between physicians and hospital clowns was reported. However, physicians proposed conditions which may streamline their encounters with hospital clowns such as clear communication prior to hospital clown visits, and the condition that visits do not impede medical interventions. Overall, paediatricians and paediatric residents view the positive impact on paediatric patients as the most important aspect of hospital clown visits, rather than the clinical efficacy of hospital clowning. In light of the growing number of hospital clowns worldwide, this article provides recommendations for arranging their encounters with paediatricians and paediatric residents to maintain optimal health care. What is known: • Previous studies show a clinically significant pain - and anxiety - reducing effect of hospital clowning in paediatric patients admitted to hospitals or undergoing (invasive) medical procedures. • In general, paediatricians have positive ideas about hospital clowns, aside from personal prejudices. What is new: • This novel study gives deeper insight into day-to-day interaction between paediatricians and hospital clowns on the ward. • This study provides recommendations for clinical practice to arrange encounters between physicians and hospital clowns during hospital clown visits.",

To study the effect of object repetitiveness of datasets on predicting results. We present novel methods to construct different positive datasets with or without repeating proteins using graph maximum matching in the protein-protein interaction datasets and corresponding series of negative datasets with different proteins repetitiveness are constructed using graph adjacency matrix. The relationship between the SVM prediction results and the repeated proteins (repeat numbers and repeat rates) and the distributions of repeated proteins in the datasets are analyzed. Protein repetitiveness of positive and negative datasets can affect the prediction result: high protein repetitiveness of positive or negative datasets yield high performance prediction result. This indicate that dealing with object repetitiveness of datasets is a key issue in protein-protein interactions prediction using SVMs since real world data contain certain degrees of repeat proteins.",

The rhesus monkey, however, has numerous advantages to the rodent and marmoset that make it a superior and irreplaceable animal model for studying stroke in the brain. In the present study, after mapping the preferred hand representation in two healthy male monkeys with intracortical micro-stimulation, ET-1 was microinjected into the contralateral motor cortex (M1) to its preferred hand. The monkeys had been trained in three manual dexterity tasks before the microinjection and were tested for these tasks following the ET-1 injection. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans were performed 1, 7, 14 and 28 days post ischemia. It was found that ET-1 impaired the manual dexterity of the monkeys in the vertical slot and rotating Brinkman board tasks 3-8 days after the injection. Brain imaging found that severe edema was present 7 days after the focal ischemia. This data suggest that ET-1 can induce transient ischemic stroke in rhesus monkey and that ET-1 induced focal ischemia in non-human primates is a potential model to study the mechanism of stroke and brain repair after stroke.",

  "28235120": "Prospective Evaluation of Opioid Consumption After Distal Radius Fracture Repair Surgery Pain management and opioid consumption after distal radius fracture (DRF) open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) are highly variable and poorly understood. To optimize postoperative opioid dosage and better understand opioid consumption patterns after DRF - ORIF, we conducted a prospective study with the hypothesis that opioid consumption would increase with worsening fracture classification and various patient demographics. All patients who underwent DRF - ORIF were consecutively enrolled over a 6-month period. Information collected included patient demographics, fracture type, anesthesia type, amount and type of opioid prescribed, number of pills taken, reason for stopping, and adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed. Ninety-eight patients (79 female, 19 male) were eligible for the study. Mean age was 58 years. Of the 98 patients, 45 received general anesthesia, and 53 received regional anesthesia with a single-shot peripheral nerve block. Mean opioid consumption (morphine equivalence) over a mean of 4.8 postoperative days (range, 0-16 days) was 58.5 mg (range, 0-280 mg). There were no significant differences in opioid consumption between the general and regional anesthesia groups. Mean opioid consumption for the 3 fracture-type groups (AO/OTA [Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association] classification) was 57.7 mg (class A), 60.3 mg (class B), and 62.0 mg (class C). Demographic analysis revealed an inverse relationship between age and opioid use. Similarly, there was a trend toward more opioid consumption among self-pay and Medicaid patients. Opioid consumption after DRF - ORIF was equivalent for general and regional anesthesia. A significant relationship was found between increasing age and decreasing opioid consumption. Worsening fracture classification and self-payment / Medicaid payment trended toward increasing opioid consumption. Mean overall opioid consumption (morphine equivalence) was 58.5 mg, or 14.6 pills of oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg. Surgeons should take these findings into account when optimizing opioid prescribing after DRF repair.",
  "27856909": "The sacral autonomic outflow is sympathetic A kinship between cranial and pelvic visceral nerves of vertebrates has been accepted for a century. Accordingly, sacral preganglionic neurons are considered parasympathetic, as are their targets in the pelvic ganglia that prominently control rectal, bladder, and genital functions. Here, we uncover 15 phenotypic and ontogenetic features that distinguish pre- and postganglionic neurons of the cranial parasympathetic outflow from those of the thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow in mice. By every single one, the sacral outflow is indistinguishable from the thoracolumbar outflow. Thus, the parasympathetic nervous system receives input from cranial nerves exclusively and the sympathetic nervous system from spinal nerves, thoracic to sacral inclusively. This simplified, bipartite architecture offers a new framework to understand pelvic neurophysiology as well as development and evolution of the autonomic nervous system.",

The associations of brachial systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure with all-cause mortality were prospectively explored (follow-up 7.0±2.2 years) in 660 community-dwelling individuals (≥60 years) using adjusted Cox models, stratified by cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] <24). No association between brachial BP variables and mortality was shown for the total sample in quartiles analysis; however, MAP in the highest quartile, compared with the second, was associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence intervals, 1.09-3.12) among cognitively impaired individuals. The fractional-polynomials approach for BP confirmed this finding and further showed, solely in the MMSE <24 subcohort, U-shaped trends of MAP and systolic BP, with increased mortality risk in extremely low or high values; no such pattern was evident for patients with MMSE ≥24. Elderly individuals with cognitive impairment might be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of low and elevated MAP and systolic BP.",

A randomized crossover study was conducted using a telesonography system that can transmit the ultrasound images displayed on the ultrasound monitor (ultrasound sequence video) and images showing the practitioner's operations (background video) to a smartphone without any interruption in motion over a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network. Thirty novice practitioners were randomly assigned to two groups. The subjects in group A (n = 15) performed ultrasonography for the identification of the appendix under mentoring by an onsite expert, whereas those in group B (n = 15) performed the same procedure under mentoring by an offsite expert. Each subject performed the procedure on three simulated patients. After a 4- week interval, they performed the procedure again under the other type of mentoring. A total of 90 ultrasound examinations were performed in each scenario. The primary outcomes were the success rate for identifying the appendix and the time required to identify the appendix. The success rates for identifying the appendix were 91.1 % (82/90) in onsite - mentored ultrasonography and 87.8 % (79/90) in offsite - mentored ultrasonography; both rates were high, and there was no significant difference (p = 0.468) between them. The time required in the case of offsite mentoring (median, 242.9 s; interquartile range (IQR), 238.2) was longer than that for onsite mentoring (median, 291.4 s; IQR, 200.9); however, the difference was not significant (p = 0.051). It appears that offsite mentoring can allow novice onsite practitioners to perform ultrasonography as effectively as they can under onsite mentoring, even for examinations that require proficiency in rather complex practices, such as identifying the appendix.",

Bivariate case-control analysis was performed, using patients who died as cases; later, analysis using a logistic regression model with variables that were associated with mortality was conducted. Four variables were consistently associated with mortality in the logistic regression model and had adequate prediction value (Hosmer and Lemeshow statistic = 0.760; Nagelkerke R-squared = 0.494). The risk of death was found to be statistically associated with the following: shock at admission to ICU [odds ratio (OR): 7.56; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.78-31.97, p = 0.006], hemoglobin level <8 g/dL (OR: 16.12; 95% CI: 3.35-77.52, p = 0.001), use of cytostatic agents prior to admission to the ICU (OR: 8.71; 95% CI: 1.23-61.5, p = 0.03), and low levels ofcomplement C3 (OR: 5.23; 95% CI: 1.28-21.35, p = 0.02). These variables can guide clinicians in the early identification of patients with AD with increased risk of death during hospitalization, leading to initial therapies seeking to improve survival. These results should be evaluated prospectively in future studies to establish their predictive power.",
  "28093575": "Development process of an assessment tool for disruptive behavior problems in cross-cultural settings: the Disruptive Behavior International Scale - Nepal version (DBIS-N) Systematic processes are needed to develop valid measurement instruments for disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) in cross-cultural settings. We employed a four-step process in Nepal to identify and select items for a culturally valid assessment instrument: 1) We extracted items from validated scales and local free-list interviews. 2) Parents, teachers, and peers (n=30) rated the perceived relevance and importance of behavior problems. 3) Highly rated items were piloted with children (n=60) in Nepal. 4) We evaluated internal consistency of the final scale. We identified 49 symptoms from 11 scales, and 39 behavior problems from free-list interviews (n=72). After dropping items for low ratings of relevance and severity and for poor item-test correlation, low frequency, and/or poor acceptability in pilot testing, 16 items remained for the Disruptive Behavior International Scale-Nepali version (DBIS-N). The final scale had good internal consistency (α=0.86). A 4-step systematic approach to scale development including local participation yielded an internally consistent scale that included culturally relevant behavior problems.",

Our case is the third to be reported and was treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy and followed for two years. A 50- year -old man suffered from a mass effect in the left abdominal side. While the laboratory showed a mild elevation in the levels of both serum cortisol and 24h urine cortisol, radiological images were highly suggested an adrenal malignant tumor without metastasis. At surgery a 22cm sized mass was completely resected. Immunohistochemical study identified expression of both adrenocortical carcinoma and pheochromocytoma markers. Cases of coincidence corticomedullary tumor have been published in many reviews, cortical and/or medulllary hypersecretion were not always detected preoperatively by biochemical tests. Mixed corticomedullary carcinoma are exceedingly rare, we came across three reported cases in medical literature, in one case laboratory tests confirmed both cortical and medulla hypersecretion, while the two others detected only cortical hypersecretion. The final diagnosis was always confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. It could be noted that this is the first comparison of presentation, diagnosis, treatments and follow-up of the three cases of Mixed corticomedullary carcinoma. This could contribute to understanding the behavior and management of this rare malignancy and make it more familiar in clinical practice.",

We test whether the protective effect of nephron sparing surgery relative to radical nephrectomy is universal or present in specific subgroups of patients. A collaborative database of 5 institutions was queried to evaluate 1,783 patients without chronic kidney disease diagnosed with a clinical T1 renal mass that was treated with nephron sparing surgery or radical nephrectomy. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was done to assess the impact of surgery type (nephron sparing surgery vs radical nephrectomy) on other cause mortality after adjustment for patient and cancer characteristics. Interaction terms were used to test the hypothesis that the impact of surgery type varies according to specific subcohorts of patients. Ten-year other cause mortality -free survival rates were 90% and 88% after nephron sparing surgery and radical nephrectomy, respectively. In the overall population radical nephrectomy was not associated with an increased risk of other cause mortality on multivariable analysis compared to nephron sparing surgery (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.6-1.38, p = 0.6). However, radical nephrectomy increased the risk of other cause mortality according to the increasing baseline Charlson comorbidity index (interaction test p = 0.0008). For example, in a patient with a Charlson comorbidity index of 4 the probability of 10-year other cause mortality -free survival was 86% after nephron sparing surgery and 60% after radical nephrectomy. Elective nephron sparing surgery does not improve other cause survival relative to radical nephrectomy consistently in all patients with kidney cancer. Patients who are more ill with relevant comorbidities are those who benefit the most from nephron sparing surgery in terms of other cause mortality.",

Coinfection with hepatitis C virus was followed by a decrease in the number of naive CD4(+) T cells and an increase in the count of central CD8(+) memory T cells in these patients. Hepatitis C virus had no effect on the number of CD4(+) memory T cells (main target for HIV). This can explain the absence of strong negative effect of hepatitis C virus on the course of HIV infection.",
  "27320863": "Alleviation of hepatic fat accumulation by betaine involves reduction of homocysteine via up-regulation of betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) We investigated the anti-lipogenic effect of betaine in rats fed methionine and choline - deficient diet (MCD). Intake of MCD for 3 wk resulted in a significant accumulation of hepatic lipids, which was prevented by betaine supplementation in drinking water (1%). Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) was inhibited by MCD intake, and these changes were all inhibited by betaine feeding. Meanwhile, betaine supplementation reversed the reduction of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and the elevation of homocysteine levels in the liver, which could be attributable to the induction of betaine-homocysteine methyltransfease (BHMT) and methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). Different cell lines were used to clarify the role of homocysteine on activation of the AMPK pathway. Homocysteine treatment decreased pAMPK, pACC, pSREBP-1c and pLKB1 in HepG2 cells. Metformin - induced activation of AMPK was also inhibited by homocysteine. Treatment with hydroxylamine, a cystathionine β-synthase inhibitor, resulted in a reduction of pAMPK, pACC and pSREBP-1c, accompanied by an elevation of intracellular homocysteine. Betaine treatment prevented the homocysteine - induced reduction of pAMPK, pACC, pSREBP-1c and pLKB1 in H4IIE cells, but not in HepG2 cells. Also the elevation of cellular homocysteine and inhibition of protein expression of BHMT were prevented by betaine only in H4IIE cells which express BHMT. The results suggest that the beneficial effect of betaine against hepatic lipid accumulation may be attributed, at least in part, to the depletion of homocysteine via up-regulation of BHMT in hepatocytes.",

Microchem J 85(1):65-71, 2007). The paper deals with quality evaluation of waters with special focus on the water chemistry parameters as defined in the Water Framework Directive and pertaining legal regulations. The purpose of this paper is to devise a quantitative type of water quality assessment method which could provide rapid, accurate, and reliable information on the quality of the surface waters by using water chemistry parameters. Quality classes have been defined for every water chemistry parameter in light of the legal limit values of the water parameters. In addition to this, weight indices were calculated on the basis of the outcome of the paired comparison of water chemistry parameters and normalized matrix. This was followed by the parametric level analysis of the water chemistry parameters, and finally, the aquatic environment index (AEI) was calculated, which provided general information on the quality of water regarding the water chemistry parameters. The method was illustrated on Lake Balaton, Hungary in which case water samples taken from Balatonfüred City lake area were analyzed and evaluated with the method devised.",
  "27703752": "Low birth weight and features of neuroticism and mood disorder in 83 545 participants of the UK Biobank cohort Low birth weight has been inconsistently associated with risk of developing affective disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). To date, studies investigating possible associations between birth weight and bipolar disorder (BD), or personality traits known to predispose to affective disorders such as neuroticism, have not been conducted in large cohorts. To assess whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) and low birth weight (1500-2490 g) were associated with higher neuroticism scores assessed in middle age, and lifetime history of either MDD or BD. We controlled for possible confounding factors. Retrospective cohort study using baseline data on the 83 545 UK Biobank participants with detailed mental health and birth weight data. Main outcomes were prevalent MDD and BD, and neuroticism assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory Neuroticism scale - Revised (EPIN-R). Referent to normal birth weight, very low / low birth weight were associated with higher neuroticism scores, increased MDD and BD. The associations between birth weight category and MDD were partially mediated by higher neuroticism. These findings suggest that intrauterine programming may play a role in lifetime vulnerability to affective disorders. None. © The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2016.

  "27508512": "A Systematic Review on Infliximab and Adalimumab Drug Monitoring: Levels, Clinical Outcomes and Assays Immunogenicity to therapeutic proteins has been linked to loss of response by a large percentage of patients taking anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents. Drug monitoring can be extremely useful, allowing physicians to adjust the therapeutic scheme individually. This article aims to systematically review the published data with respect to cutoff levels of infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) and relate them to the methodology adopted for quantification of IFX and ADA levels and clinical outcomes. The PubMed database was searched to identify studies focusing on the association between IFX or ADA cutoff levels and clinical outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Of the 1654 articles initially selected by queries, 20 were included. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify cutoff levels of IFX or ADA that correlated with a clinical outcome, but only 6 studies performed the same analysis for antidrug antibody levels. Cutoff levels were different between studies. The methodology chosen for level quantifications, clinical outcomes, and sample size and characteristics were also different. Nevertheless, measurement of drug levels should be performed during maintenance, and with loss of response, with persistent high levels of C-reactive protein, and when mucosal lesions are still present. In these scenarios, drug and antidrug levels were correlated with clinical outcomes. Concerning drug levels monitoring any methodology is adequate. With respect to antidrug antibody levels, it will be necessary to define a gold standard method or to establish different cutoff levels for different methodologies.",
  "27373893": "Components of treatment delay in rheumatoid arthritis differ according to autoantibody status: validation of a single-centre observation using national audit data To determine whether time to treatment following symptom onset differs between RA patients according to autoantibody status. A single-centre retrospective analysis of a UK early RA inception cohort was first undertaken to identify those components of the patient journey that differed by serological subtype. Data from a UK national audit of early inflammatory arthritis patients was accessed to replicate the key finding. A total of 173 RA patients were diagnosed over a 31- month period, of whom 80 (46%) were ACPA/RF double-seropositive (ACPA(+)/RF(+)), 53 (31%) ACPA(-)/RF(-), 17 (10%) ACPA(+)/RF(-) and 23 (13%) RF(+)/ACPA(-) Overall, ACPA(+)/RF(+) patients experienced significantly longer symptom duration before DMARD initiation. This was accounted for by delays in their presentation to primary care following symptom onset -a finding that was robustly confirmed in an independent dataset of 2192 UK early RA patients. In contrast, ACPA(-)/RF(-) patients were significantly more likely to experience delays in DMARD initiation after presenting to secondary care. Causes of treatment delays in early RA differ according to patients ' autoantibody status. More insidious symptom onset and/or distinct health-seeking behaviours among ACPA(+)/RF(+) patients may contribute to late presentations in primary care, whereas ACPA(-)/RF(-) patients experience delayed diagnosis and treatment in secondary care. These observations inform the research agenda, potentially influencing the design of service delivery for early arthritis patients.",
  "28282614": "Inhibition of Drp1 protects against senecionine - induced mitochondria -mediated apoptosis in primary hepatocytes and in mice Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a group of compounds found in various plants and some of them are widely consumed in the world as herbal medicines and food supplements. PAs are potent hepatotoxins that cause irreversible liver injury in animals and humans. However, the mechanisms by which PAs induce liver injury are not clear. In the present study, we determined the hepatotoxicity and molecular mechanisms of senecionine, one of the most common toxic PAs, in primary cultured mouse and human hepatocytes as well as in mice. We found that senecionine administration increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels in mice. H&E and TUNEL staining of liver tissues revealed increased hemorrhage and hepatocyte apoptosis in liver zone 2 areas. Mechanistically, senecionine induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c as well as mitochondrial JNK translocation and activation prior to the increased DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation in primary cultured mouse and human hepatocyte s. SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor, and ZVAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor, alleviated senecionine -induced apoptosis in primary hepatocytes. Interestingly, senecionine also caused marked mitochondria fragmentation in hepatocytes. Pharmacological inhibition of dynamin-related protein1 (Drp1), a protein that is critical to regulate mitochondrial fission, blocked senecionine - induced mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and apoptosis. More importantly, hepatocyte -specific Drp1 knockout mice were resistant to senecionine - induced liver injury due to decreased mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. In conclusion, our results uncovered a novel mechanism of Drp1 -mediated mitochondrial fragmentation in senecionine - induced liver injury. Targeting Drp1 -mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis may be a potential avenue to prevent and treat hepatotoxicity induced by PAs.",
  "27388786": "Examining the contribution of motor movement and language dominance to increased left lateralization during sign generation in native signers The neural systems supporting speech and sign processing are very similar, although not identical. In a previous fTCD study of hearing native signers (Gutierrez-Sigut, Daws, et al., 2015) we found stronger left lateralization for sign than speech. Given that this increased lateralization could not be explained by hand movement alone, the contribution of motor movement versus ' linguistic ' processes to the strength of hemispheric lateralization during sign production remains unclear. Here we directly contrast lateralization strength of covert versus overt signing during phonological and semantic fluency tasks. To address the possibility that hearing native signers ' elevated lateralization indices (LIs) were due to performing a task in their less dominant language, here we test deaf native signers, whose dominant language is British Sign Language (BSL). Signers were more strongly left lateralized for overt than covert sign generation. However, the strength of lateralization was not correlated with the amount of time producing movements of the right hand. Comparisons with previous data from hearing native English speakers suggest stronger laterality indices for sign than speech in both covert and overt tasks. This increased left lateralization may be driven by specific properties of sign production such as the increased use of self-monitoring mechanisms or the nature of phonological encoding of signs.",

Rarely it may occur in patients with autoimmune markers but no definable autoimmune disease (Primary-AIMF). We report the cases of two young women with SLE - associated AIMF (SLE - AIMF). The first patient was a young woman who had pancytopenia, massive splenomegaly and reticulin fibrosis in the marrow biopsy. The pancytopenia and splenomegaly resolved completely within weeks of treatment with corticosteroids. Repeat marrow biopsy showed marked regression of marrow fibrosis. The second patient was a young woman with fever, anasarca, bicytopenia and reticulin fibrosis in the marrow biopsy. Steroid therapy resulted in rapid clinical improvement and resolution of pancytopenia. A review of the literature revealed a total of 30 patients with SLE - AIMF reported to- date. Patients with SLE - AIMF are young women with SLE and blood cytopenia who are found to have increased bone marrow reticulin on marrow biopsy. Steroid therapy results in rapid hematological recovery and regression of marrow fibrosis. Whether AIMF is one of several hematological complications of SLE, or represents a unique and distinct subset of patients with SLE in not clear. Prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed to better define the prevalence and clinical spectrum of SLE - AIMF.",
  "27657150": "Comparison of Very Low Energy Diet Products Available in Australia and How to Tailor Them to Optimise Protein Content for Younger and Older Adult Men and Women Very low energy diets (VLED) are efficacious in inducing rapid weight loss but may not contain adequate macronutrients or micronutrients for individuals with varying nutritional requirements. Adequate protein intake during weight loss appears particularly important to help preserve fat free mass and control appetite, and low energy and carbohydrate content also contributes to appetite control. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the nutritional content (with a focus on protein), nutritional adequacy and cost of all commercially-available VLED brands in Australia. Nutritional content and cost were extracted and compared between brands and to the Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) or adequate intake (AI) of macronutrients and micronutrients for men and women aged 19-70 years or >70 years. There was wide variability in the nutritional content, nutritional adequacy and cost of VLED brands. Most notably, even brands with the highest daily protein content, based on consuming three products/day (KicStart™ and Optislim(®), ~60 g/day), only met estimated protein requirements of the smallest and youngest women for whom a VLED would be indicated. Considering multiple options to optimise protein content, we propose that adding pure powdered protein is the most suitable option because it minimizes additional energy, carbohydrate and cost of VLEDs.",
  "28122499": "Uridine stimulate laxative effect in the loperamide - induced constipation of SD rats through regulation of the mAChRs signaling pathway and mucin secretion Uridine (Urd), which has been reported as a major component of RNA, plays an important role in various biological process including neuroprotection, biochemical modulation and glycolysis, although its role in constipation has yet to be established. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the laxative effects of Urd on chronic constipation. The constipation phenotypes and their related mechanisms were investigated in the transverse colons of SD rats with loperamide (Lop)- induced constipation after treatment with 100 mg/kg of Urd. The number, weight and water contents of stools were significantly higher in the Lop + Urd treated group than the Lop + Vehicle treated group, while food intake and water consumption of the same group were maintained at a constant level. The thickness of the mucosa layer, muscle and flat luminal surface, as well as the number of goblet cells, paneth cells and lipid droplets were enhanced in the Lop + Urd treated group. Furthermore, the expression of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M2 and M3 (mAChR M2 and M3) at the transcriptional and translational level was recovered in the Lop + Urd treated group, while some markers such as Gα and inositol triphosphate (IP3) in their downstream signaling pathway were completely recovered by Urd treatment. Moreover, the ability for mucin secretion and the expression of membrane water channel (aquaporine 8, AQP8) were increased significantly in the Lop + Urd treated group compared with Lop + Vehicle treated group. Finally, the activity of Urd was confirmed in primary smooth muscle of rat intestine cells (pRISMC) based on Gα expression and IP3 concentration. The results of the present study provide the first strong evidence that Urd can be considered an important candidate for improving chronic constipation induced by Lop treatment in animal models.",

Since most dental materials are used in a moist environment, Portland cement has been developed for use in dentistry. The first generation material is mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), used in surgical procedures, thus in contact with blood. The aim of this study was to compare the setting of MTA in vitro and in vivo in contact with blood by subcutaneous implantation in rats. The tissue reaction to the material was also investigated. ProRoot MTA (Dentsply) was implanted in the subcutaneous tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats in opposite flanks and left in situ for 3 months. Furthermore the material was also stored in physiological solution in vitro. At the end of the incubation time, tissue histology and material characterization were performed. Surface assessment showed the formation of calcium carbonate for both environments. The bismuth was evident in the tissues thus showing heavy element contamination of the animal specimen. The tissue histology showed a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate associated with the MTA. MTA interacts with the host tissues and causes a chronic inflammatory reaction when implanted subcutaneously. Hydration in vivo proceeds similarly to the in vitro model with some differences particularly in the bismuth oxide leaching patterns.",
  "27449508": "Modulation of Interleukins in Sepsis - Associated Clotting Disorders: Interplay With Hemostatic Derangement Interleukins play a central role in the immune system and are involved in a variety of immunological, inflammatory, and infectious disease states including sepsis syndrome. Levels of interleukins may correlate with overall survival and may directly or indirectly affect some of the regulators of coagulation and fibrinolysis, thereby disrupting hemostasis and thrombosis. Our hypothesis is that in sepsis-associated coagulopathies (SACs), interleukins may be upregulated, leading to hemostatic imbalance by generating thrombogenic mediators. We profiled the levels of interleukins IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in addition to d-dimer (DD) in patients with SAC and in normal donors. We observed the highest increase in interleukins IL-6 (322-fold), IL-8 (48-fold), IL-10 (72-fold), and DD (18-fold). This suggests that interleukins such as IL-6 and IL-10 have a close association with coagulopathy and fibrinolytic dysregulation in sepsis and can be considered as candidates for potential therapeutic targets in SAC.",
  "27252099": "Comparison of Head Elevation Protocols Following Femoral Artery Sheath Removal After Coronary Angiography To compare 2 standard protocols for head elevation following removal of a femoral artery sheath after coronary angiography and their effects on bleeding complications and reported levels of back pain. One protocol involved flat supine bed rest; the other allowed progressive head elevation. A prospective comparative study of 80 adult patients undergoing coronary angiography via the femoral approach. The Numeric Rating Scale was used as the measure of reported pain. No bleeding complications occurred in either group. Both groups had very low mean pain scores. Repeated- measures analysis demonstrated that the experience of pain differed significantly over time by location (F5,70 = 3.864, P = .004), with a notable decrease in pain scores more than 1 hour after sheath removal at the location that used the progressive head elevation protocol. Patients ' satisfaction scores after discharge did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Patients with a history of chronic back pain had consistently higher pain scores, but those pain scores did not differ significantly by location (or protocol). It appears that using a progressive head - elevation protocol within the first 3 hours after diagnostic angiography is not associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications at the access site and warrants further exploration in the mitigation of back pain associated with prolonged supine bed rest.",

There are limited studies on epidemiology of swine flu in Indian context. This study aims to analyze clinical and epidemiological profile of suspected swine flu cases in central India. 171 cases were included in a hospital based, observational, descriptive study conducted from December 2014 to April 2015. Demographics, clinical presentation and outcome of positive and negative cases were compared. Data was analyzed using STATA software. Distribution by age, sex and residence was found similar (p > 0.05) in positive and negative cases. Cough (89%), fever (85%) and throat irritation (51%) were chief complaints (avg. duration = 4.9 days). History of travel, history of contact with swine flu cases (p = 0.002) and history of visiting crowded places (p = 0.098) was reported considerably in higher proportion in positive cases as compared to negative cases. There were 14 deaths and they occurred significantly in younger age among positive cases as compared to negatives (Mean ± SD: 34 ± 2.8 vs 47 ± 8.4 years). Case fatality ratio (CFR) in positive cases showing history of travel, contact with swine flu cases, requiring invasive ventilator support and >3 X-ray zones involvement were significantly higher.

  "27900133": "The relationships between rugby players' tackle training attitudes and behaviour and their match tackle attitudes and behaviour The tackle event in rugby is a technical and physical contest between opposing players. A player's ability to tolerate and contest during a tackle is a prerequisite for safe participation and success in rugby. Little is known about the relationship between tackle training and tackling in matches in rugby union. Therefore, we investigated the relationships between players' training attitudes and behaviour and their match attitudes and behaviour for tackling in rugby union. A questionnaire was designed to assess attitude (importance) and behaviours (frequency and quantity) among junior (under 19) players on a 5-point Likert Scale. Questionnaires were handed out to 220 players (10 schools) at a tournament and 75% (9 schools, n=164) were returned for analysis. Associations between training attitudes and behaviours were tested using the χ(2) test, Cramer's V and τ-b. The more time spent on emphasising proper technique to prevent injuries in training, the more important players rated 'own safety' (τ-b=0.21, moderate, z=3.1, p<0.01), 'going for the ball only' (τ-b=0.27, moderate, z=4.6, p<0.001) and 'staying on feet' (τ-b=0.23, moderate, z=3.6, p<0.001) in match play. The more time spent on emphasising proper technique to improve performance in training, the more important players rated actions 'going for ball only' (τ-b=0.23, moderate, z=3.7, p<0.001) and ' preventing the ball carrier from retaining position ' (τ-b=0.20, moderate, z=3.1, p<0.01) in match play. This is the first study to report on the relationships between players ' training attitudes and behaviour and their match attitudes and behaviour s for tackling in rugby union. The importance of tackle training to prevent injury, and the amount of time spent on technique to prevent injuries, was associated with behaviours that reduce the risk of injury in matches.",
  "27587390": "Amino Acids Regulate mTORC1 by an Obligate Two-step Mechanism The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) coordinates cell growth with its nutritional, hormonal, energy, and stress status. Amino acids are critical regulators of mTORC1 that permit other inputs to mTORC1 activity. However, the roles of individual amino acids and their interactions in mTORC1 activation are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that activation of mTORC1 by amino acids includes two discrete and separable steps: priming and activation. Sensitizing mTORC1 activation by priming amino acids is a prerequisite for subsequent stimulation of mTORC1 by activating amino acids. Priming is achieved by a group of amino acids that includes l-asparagine, l-glutamine, l-threonine, l-arginine, l-glycine, l-proline, l-serine, l-alanine, and l-glutamic acid. The group of activating amino acids is dominated by l-leucine but also includes l-methionine, l-isoleucine, and l-valine. l-Cysteine predominantly inhibits priming but not the activating step. Priming and activating steps differ in their requirements for amino acid concentration and duration of treatment. Priming and activating amino acids use mechanisms that are distinct both from each other and from growth factor signaling. Neither step requires intact tuberous sclerosis complex of proteins to activate mTORC1. Concerted action of priming and activating amino acids is required to localize mTORC1 to lysosomes and achieve its activation.",
  "28532359": "Visual Confidence Visual confidence refers to an observer's ability to judge the accuracy of her perceptual decisions. Even though confidence judgments have been recorded since the early days of psychophysics, only recently have they been recognized as essential for a deeper understanding of visual perception. The reluctance to study visual confidence may have come in part from obtaining convincing experimental evidence in favor of metacognitive abilities rather than just perceptual sensitivity. Some effort has thus been dedicated to offer different experimental paradigms to study visual confidence in humans and nonhuman animals. To understand the origins of confidence judgments, investigators have developed two competing frameworks. The approach based on signal decision theory is popular but fails to account for response times. In contrast, the approach based on accumulation of evidence models naturally includes the dynamics of perceptual decisions. These models can explain a range of results, including the apparently paradoxical dissociation between performance and confidence that is sometimes observed.",

However, the roles of apoliprotein (Apo) E (Apoe) and low-density lipoprotein (Ldl) receptor (Ldlr) in colorectal carcinogenesis have not yet been investigated. In this study, we examined the susceptibility of Apoe - deficient and Ldlr - deficient mice, which are genetic animal models of atherosclerosis to azoxymethane (AOM)/ dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- induced colorectal carcinogenesis. In Experiment 1, male Apoe - deficient (n = 20) and wild type (WT) mice (C57BL/6J, n = 21) were treated with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of AOM (10 mg/kg body weight) and then given 1.5% DSS in drinking water for seven days. They were maintained up to week 20 and sacrificed for the histopathological examination of colorectal tumors. The mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2), tumor necrosis factor (Tnf)-α interleukin (Il)-1β, and Il-6 was assayed in the colorectal mucosa. In Experiment 2, male Ldlr - deficient (n = 14) and WT mice (C57BL/6J, n = 10) were given a single i.p. injection of AOM (10 mg/kg body weight) and then given 2% DSS in drinking water for seven days. They were sacrificed at week 20 to evaluate their colorectum histopathologically. In Experiment 1, the multiplicity of CRCs was significantly higher in the Apoe - deficient mice (2.75 ± 1.48) than in the WT mice (0.62 ± 0.67). The serum lipoprotein levels in the Apoe - deficient mice were also significantly higher than in the WT mice. In Experiment 2, the incidence (29%) and multiplicity (0.50 ± 0.94) of CRCs in the Ldlr mice were significantly lower than in the WT mice (80% incidence and 3.10 ± 2.38 multiplicity). The mRNA expression of two inducible enzymes and certain pro-inflammatory cytokines in the colorectum of each genotype was greater than in the respective WT mice. The values in the Apoe - deficient mice were much greater than in the Ldlr mice. These findings suggest that Apoe - deficient mice showed increased susceptibility to inflammation - associated colorectal carcinogenesis due to their high reactivity to inflammatory stimuli.",
  "28416598": "EBV MicroRNA BART16 Suppresses Type I IFN Signaling Type I IFNs play critical roles in orchestrating the antiviral defense by inducing direct antiviral activities and shaping the adaptive immune response. Viruses have evolved numerous strategies to specifically interfere with IFN production or its downstream mediators, thereby allowing successful infection of the host to occur. The prototypic human gammaherpesvirus EBV, which is associated with infectious mononucleosis and malignant tumors, harbors many immune-evasion proteins that manipulate the adaptive and innate immune systems. In addition to proteins, the virus encodes >40 mature microRNAs for which the functions remain largely unknown. In this article, we identify EBV - encoded miR-BART16 as a novel viral immune-evasion factor that interferes with the type I IFN signaling pathway. miR-BART16 directly targets CREB-binding protein, a key transcriptional coactivator in IFN signaling, thereby inducing CREB-binding protein downregulation in EBV-transformed B cells and gastric carcinoma cells. miR-BART16 abrogates the production of IFN - stimulated genes in response to IFN-α stimulation and it inhibits the antiproliferative effect of IFN-α on latently infected BL cells. By obstructing the type I IFN - induced antiviral response, miR-BART16 provides a means to facilitate the establishment of latent EBV infection and enhance viral replication.",

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain FA102T formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the family Marinifilaceae and its closest relative was Marinifilum fragile JCM 15579T (93.2% sequence similarity). The DNA G+C content of the novel strain was 36.5 mol%. The predominant cellular fatty acids and respiratory quinone were iso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0 3-OH, and MK-7, respectively. On the basis of the phylogenetic, phenotypic and physiological data, strain FA102T represents a novel genus and species, for which the name Ancylomarina subtilis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Ancylomarina subtilis is FA102T (= KCTC 42257T = DSM 28825T = CICC 10902T). Furthermore, a new order named Marinilabiliales is proposed to accommodate three families previously classified in the order Bacteroidales. Marinilabiliales ord. nov. encompasses the families Marinilabiliaceae, Prolixibacteraceae and Marinifilaceae.",
  "28516341": "Fairness: the hidden challenge for competency-based postgraduate medical education programs Competency-based medical education systems allow institutions to individualize teaching practices to meet the needs of diverse learners. Yet, the focus on continuous improvement and individualization of curricula does not exempt programs from treating learners in a fair manner. When learners fail to meet key competencies and are placed on probation or dismissed from training programs, issues of fairness may form the basis of their legal claims. In a literature search, we found no in-depth examination of fairness. In this paper, we utilize a systems lens to examine fairness within postgraduate medical education contexts, focusing on educational opportunities, assessment practices, decision-making processes, fairness from a legal standpoint, and fairness in the context of the learning environment. While we provide examples of fairness issues within US training programs, concerns regarding fairness are relevant in any medical education system which utilizes a competency-based education framework. Assessment oversight committees and annual programmatic evaluations, while recommended, will not guarantee fairness within postgraduate medical education programs, but they can provide a window into 'hidden' threats to fairness, as everything from training experiences to assessment practices may be examined by these committees. One of the first steps programs can take is to recognize that threats to fairness may exist in any educational program, including their own, and begin conversations about how to address these issues.",
  "27573702": "Cerebral toxoplasmosis in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the neurological emergency department of a tertiary hospital Cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of space occupying brain lesion in patients with HIV/AIDS in Brazil. In the post-HAART era, it is responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study consists of a case series of 56 patients diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis whose clinical features, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid aspects were analyzed. Cerebral toxoplasmosis led to the diagnosis of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 27 (48.2%) of the patients, while 29 (51.2%) others already knew to be HIV seropositive. However, at the time of diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis, only 9 (16.6%) reported being under antiretroviral therapy and 5 (8.9%) were receiving primary prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis. Headache, strength deficit and fever were the most frequent signs and symptoms throughout the study. Fifty-three patients showed changes consistent with toxoplasmosis in CT or MRI. Thirty-four (60.7%) CSF samples were positive in the indirect haemagglutination test and for the reaction of Toxoplasma gondii IgG ELISA, while 31 (55.4%) were positive in the direct haemagglutination test. Fifty (89.3%) patients underwent first-line treatment for toxoplasmosis. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is still a very relevant neurological disease in individuals with AIDS admitted to neurology emergency departments. Early diagnosis and initiation of empiric treatment and antiretroviral therapy are important for good prognosis.",
  "27426713": "Development of Community Based Learning and Education system within Undergraduate Medical Curriculum of Patan Academy of Health Sciences In response to continuing health disparities between rural and urban population, Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS) was established in 2008. It aimed to produce physicians who would be able and willing to serve in the rural areas. In order to empower them with understanding and tools to address health issues of rural population, an innovative curriculum was developed. This paper aims to describe the community based learning and education (CBLE) system within the overall framework of PAHS undergraduate medical curriculum. A Medical School Steering Committee (MSSC) comprising of a group of committed medical educators led the curriculum development process. The committee reviewed different medical curricula, relevant literatures, and held a series of consultative meetings with the stakeholders and experts within and outside Nepal. This process resulted in defining the desirable attributes, terminal competencies of the graduates, and then the actual development of the entire curriculum including CBLE. Given the critical importance of population health, 25% of the curricular weightage was allocated to the Community Health Sciences (CHS). CBLE system was developed as the primary means of delivering CHS curriculum. The details of CBLE system was finalized for implementation with the first cohort of medical students commencing their studies from June 2010. The CBLE, a key educational strategy of PAHS curriculum, is envisaged to improve retention and performance of PAHS graduates and, thereby, health status of rural population. However, whether or not that goal will be achieved needs to be verified after the graduates join the health system.",

To evaluate the effects of Transcendental Meditation (TM) on trauma symptoms in male inmates. One hundred eighty-one inmates with a moderate - to high-risk criminal profile were randomly assigned to either the TM program or to a usual care control group. The Trauma Symptom Checklist and the Perceived Stress Scale were administered at baseline and four-month posttest. Significant reductions in total trauma symptoms, anxiety, depression, dissociation, and sleep disturbance subscales, and perceived stress in the TM group were found compared with controls (all p values < 0.001). The high - trauma subgroup analysis further showed a higher magnitude of effects in the TM group compared with controls on all outcomes, with Cohen effect sizes ranging from 0.67 to 0.89. Results are consistent with those of prior studies of the TM program in other populations and its effects on trauma symptoms and perceived stress.",
  "27473429": "Parallel-processing continuous-flow device for optimization - free polymerase chain reaction A parallel-processing four-station polymerase chain reaction (PCR) device has been developed, which performs continuous-flow PCR without optimization of the annealing temperature. Since the annealing temperature of each station can be controlled independently, the device covers an annealing temperature range of 50-68 °C, which is wide enough to perform PCR for any DNA fragment regardless of its optimum annealing condition. This arrangement lets us continuously obtain an amplified amount of a DNA fragment at least from one of the stations. The device consists of four identical cylindrical stations (diameter 20 mm, height 55 mm). A polytetrafluoroethylene capillary reactor (length 2 m, I.D. 100 μm, O.D. 400 μm) is wound helically up around each station. The whole assembly is designed to minimize the number of heating blocks (for providing temperatures of denaturation, annealing, and extension) to be seven and to shape a compact cube (height 55 mm, base 60 mm × 60 mm). The reproducibility for continuous-flow PCR is reasonably high (run -to- run and station -to- station relative standard deviation of their amplification is lower than 6 % and about 4 %, respectively). Performance on the optimization - free DNA amplification has been evaluated with four DNA samples with different annealing conditions and product sizes (323, 608, 828, and 1101 bp), which has demonstrated that in all cases, PCR is successful at least on one station. In addition, three DNA fragment s with different lengths (323, 1101, and 2836 bp) have been successfully amplified in a segmented - flow mode without the carry-over contamination between segments. This result suggests that this device could serve as the PCR module of a continuous-flow high-throughput on-line total DNA analysis system integrating all necessary modules from cell lysis / DNA extraction to PCR product analysis.",
  "28055142": "Executive functions deficits impair extinction of generalization of fear of movement-related pain Generalization of fear of movement-related pain across novel but similar movements can lead to fear responses to movements that are actually not associated with pain. The peak-shift effect describes a phenomenon whereby particular novel movements elicit even greater fear responses than the original pain-provoking movement (CS+), because they represent a more extreme version of the CS+. There is great variance in the propensity to generalize as well as the speed of extinction learning when these novel movements are not followed by pain. It can be argued that this variance may be associated with executive function capacity, as individuals may be unable to intentionally inhibit fear responses. This study examined whether executive function capacity contributes to generalization and extinction of generalization as well as peak-shift of conditioned fear of movement-related pain and expectancy. Healthy participants performed a proprioceptive fear conditioning task. Executive function tests assessing updating, switching, and inhibition were used to predict changes in (extinction of) fear of movement-related pain and pain expectancy generalization. Low inhibitory capacity was associated with slower extinction of generalized fear of movement-related pain and pain expectancy. Evidence was found in favor of an area-shift, rather than a peak-shift effect, which implies that the peak conditioned fear response extended to, but did not shift to a novel stimulus. Participants with low inhibitory capacity may have difficulties withholding fear responses, leading to a slower decrease of generalized fear over time. The findings may be relevant to inform treatments. Low inhibitory capacity is not associated with slower generalization, but extinction of fear generalization. Fear elicited by a novel safe movement, situated outside the CS+/- continuum on the CS+ side, can be as strong as to the original stimulus predicting the pain-onset.",

This study aimed to increase the proportion of toddlers screened for ASD and improve physicians ' self-efficacy in providing care to children with ASD. Twenty-six Utah primary care practices participated in a 3 to 6 month learning collaborative (LC) to improve identification and ongoing care of children with ASD. Monthly chart audits assessed whether an ASD screening tool was administered at 18- and 24- month visits. Physicians completed pre-LC and post-LC surveys to assess changes in self-efficacy in providing care and changes in perceived barriers to implementation of screening and caring for children with ASD. Before the LC, 15% of 18- and 24- month visits had documented ASD screening, compared with 91% during the last month of the LC (P < .001). This rate of ASD screening was sustained 4 years after the LC by most practices. Compared with survey responses before the LC, physicians reported significant improvement in their ability to care for children with ASD and decreases in their perceived barriers to screening and caring for children with ASD. The LC was effective in increasing and sustaining recommended ASD screening of toddlers and improving physicians ' perceived self-efficacy in caring for children with ASD. Improving primary care screening, skills, and knowledge may improve the timing of diagnosis, initiation of treatment, quality of care, and outcomes for children with ASD.",
  "28298837": "A study of acute muscle dysfunction with particular reference to dengue myopathy Acute myopathy is a common cause of acute motor quadriparesis which has various etiologies with different courses of illness and prognosis depending on the cause. Understanding this diversity helps us in proper approach toward diagnosis, predicting the prognosis, and possible complications and in improving the treatments that are being provided. This study was planned to study the clinical, electrophysiological, and etiological profile of patients presenting with acute myopathy. We also studied how dengue -related acute myopathy differs from other causes and also difference between myopathy due to myositis and hypokalemia in cases of dengue. This was a prospective, observational study involving all clinically suspected cases of acute myopathy of not more than 4 weeks duration with raised serum creatine kinase (CK) level. They were subjected to detailed clinical evaluation along with hematological, biochemical, microbiological, and electrophysiological studies and followed-up for outcome at 1 and 3 months. Muscle biopsy and histopathological examination were done in selected patients after taking informed consent. Statistical analysis was performed by appropriate methods using SPSS version 16.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). We evaluated thirty patients of acute myopathy with raised CK level. Seventeen patients had fever, 11 had myalgia, and 5 had skin lesions. All presented with symmetric weakness, 17 (56.7%) patients having predominantly proximal weakness, neck or truncal weakness in 6 (20%), hyporeflexia in 12 (40%), with mean Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score of 46.67 ± 6.0. Eight (mean modified Barthel index [MBI] at presentation - 15 ± 3.7) patients had poor functional status according to MBI and 15 according to modified Rankin scale (MRS) (mean MRS score - 2.5 ± 1.2). Etiology was dengue viral infection in 14 patients; hypokalemia due to various causes other than dengue in 8; pyomyositis in 3; dermatomyositis, polymyositis, thyrotoxicosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and unknown etiology in one each. Only eight patients had abnormal electrophysiology and seven among nine biopsies done were abnormal. At 1 month, 24 (80.0%) and 23 (76.7%) patients had achieved normal MBI and MRS scores with 28 (93.3) and 27 (90%) patients, respectively, at 3 months. Dengue with hypokalemia had less myalgia, more of hyporeflexia, and lower serum CK compared to those without hypokalemia. Dengue infection and hypokalemia due to various causes are the most common causes of acute myopathy and are associated with rapid and complete recovery within 1 month. Shorter duration of illness, higher MRC sum score, better disability status at presentation, lower serum CK correlate with better outcome. Biopsy was decisive in <20% cases; hence, it is not primary investigation in acute myopathy.",
  "28102508": "Simvastatin Promotes Hematoma Absorption and Reduces Hydrocephalus Following Intraventricular Hemorrhage in Part by Upregulating CD36 We previously found that hematoma worsens hydrocephalus after intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) via increasing iron deposition and aggravating ependymal cilia injury; therefore, promoting hematoma absorption may be a promising strategy for IVH. Recently, some investigations imply that simvastatin has the ability of accelerating hematoma absorption. Thus, this study was designed to examine the efficacy of simvastatin for IVH in rats. Intracerebral hemorrhage with ventricular extension was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats after autologous blood injection. Simvastatin or vehicle was administered orally at 1 day after IVH and then daily for 1 week. MRI studies were performed to measure the volumes of intracranial hematoma and lateral ventricle at days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after IVH. Motor and neurocognitive functions were assessed at days 1 to 7 and 23 to 28, respectively. Iron deposition, iron -related protein expression, ependymal damage, and histology were detected at day 28. Expression of CD36 scavenger receptor (facilitating phagocytosis) was examined at day 3 after IVH using western blotting and immunofluorescence. Simvastatin significantly increased hematoma absorption ratio, reduced ventricular volume, and attenuated neurological dysfunction post- IVH. In addition, less iron accumulation and more cilia survival was observed in the simvastatin group when compared with the control. What's more, higher expression of CD36 was detected around the hematoma after simvastatin administration. Simvastatin significantly enhanced brain hematoma absorption, alleviated hydrocephalus, and improved neurological recovery after experimental IVH, which may in part by upregulating CD36 expression. Our data suggest that early simvastatin use may be a novel therapy for IVH patients.",

The results showed that the production of reactive oxygen species increased in a concentration -dependent manner after exposure to PFOS for 96 h. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity was elevated after exposure to the lower concentrations and then decreased with higher concentrations. Malondialdehyde content was significantly higher than that of controls at the higher PFOS concentrations. Cell membrane permeability increased. These results indicate that PFOS exposure leads to oxidative damage in C. vulgaris. At these concentrations, chlorophyll and the structure of chloroplasts were destroyed.",

By searching multiple databases from 1990 to March 2016, all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the effect of trastuzumab - combined chemotherapy (TC) versus chemotherapy alone (CT) in gastric cancer would be included. Five RCTs with a total of 875 patients were included. Trastuzumab can improve the overall survival (OS) rate, progression-free survival (PFS), one-year survival rate, two-year survival rate and overall response rate (ORR) of patients with AGC. There were no difference between the two arms in terms of grade 3 / 4 adverse effects, such as vomiting, nausea, neutropenia, thrombocytopaenia and anemia. Diarrhea increased in TC group. Trastuzumab can significantly improve the survival rate, PFS, ORR of patients with AGC. It is safe and feasible and can be tolerated. It needs further prospective multinational multicenter RCTs with large samples to define the clinical benefits of trastuzumab.",

Fourteen healthy volunteers were segregated into control and ONS groups. Volunteers in the ONS group ingested 250 ml of Arginaid Water (Nestle Japan, Tokyo, Japan) in the evening before the experiment and at 7:00 am on the day of the experiment. Volunteers in the control group fasted after dinner and drank only water until 7:00 am on the day of the experiment. In both groups, blood was collected at 9:00 am. The serum total oxidant levels and antioxidant capacity were assessed by d-ROMs (derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites) test and BAP (biological antioxidant potential) test, respectively. In the ONS group, the serum d-ROMs level was significantly lower than in the control group (297 ± 43 and 327 ± 41 U.CARR, respectively, p = 0.018), while the serum BAP level was significantly higher than the control group (2410 ± 432 and 1979 ± 397 µmol/l, respectively, p = 0.005). The OXY level of Arginaid Water was much higher than preOp drink (Nutricia, Ireland). In conclusion, our study showed that an ONS with arginine loading could decrease oxidative stress and increase antioxidant capacity in healthy volunteers.",
  "27707812": "Spontaneous activity is correlated with coding density in primary auditory cortex Sensory neurons across sensory modalities and specific processing areas have diverse levels of spontaneous firing rates (SFRs) in the absence of sensory stimuli. However, the functional significance of this spontaneous activity is not well-understood. Previous studies in the auditory system have demonstrated that different levels of spontaneous activity are correlated with a variety of physiological and anatomic properties, suggesting that neurons with differing SFRs make unique contributions to the encoding of auditory stimuli. Additionally, altered SFRs are a correlate of tinnitus, arising in several auditory areas after exposure to ototoxic substances and noise trauma. In this study, we recorded single-unit activity from primary auditory cortex of awake marmoset monkeys while delivering wide-band random-spectrum stimuli and white Gaussian noise (WGN) to examine any divergences in stimulus encoding properties across SFR classes. We found that higher levels of spontaneous activity were associated with both higher levels of activation relative to suppression across a variety of wide-band stimuli and higher driven rates in response to WGN. Moreover, response latencies to WGN were negatively correlated with the level of activation in response to both stimulus types. These findings are consistent with a novel view of the role spontaneous spiking may play during normal stimulus processing in primary auditory cortex and how it may malfunction in cases of tinnitus.",
  "26316050": "Prevascularized silicon membranes for the enhancement of transport to implanted medical devices Recent advances in drug delivery and sensing devices for in situ applications are limited by the diffusion -limiting foreign body response of fibrous encapsulation. In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  "28192066": "Performance of Debaryomyces hansenii as a Diet for Rotifers for Feeding Zebrafish Larvae The zebrafish larval stage is a critical moment due to high mortality rates associated with inadequate supplies of nutritional requirements. Larval feeding has important challenges associated with such factors as small mouth gape (≈100 μm), the low activity of digestive enzymes, and the intake of live food. A common zebrafish live food at the onset of exogenous feeding is rotifers, mainly Brachionus plicatilis. These rotifers should be fed with other microorganisms such as microalgae or yeast, mostly from the Saccharomyces genus. In the laboratory, the culture of microalgae is more expensive than the culture of yeast. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of Debaryomyces hansenii as a diet for rotifers in comparison to a microalgae -based diet (Rotigrow(®)). To achieve this aim, we assessed the rotifer total protein content, the rotifers fatty acid profile, zebrafish larval growth performance, the expression of key growth, and endocrine appetite regulation genes. The total protein and fatty acids content were similar in both rotifer cultures, averaging 35% of dry matter (DM) and 18% of DM, respectively. Interestingly, the fatty acids profile showed differences between the two rotifer cultures: omega-3 fatty acids were only observed in the Microalgae / rotifer, whereas, omega-6 fatty acids presented similar levels in both rotifer cultures. No differences were observed in the larval body length distribution or mortalities between the rotifer cultures. However, gh, igf-1, and cck gene expression showed significantly higher upregulation in zebrafish fed the Microalgae / rotifer diet compared with those fed the Debaryomyces / rotifer diet. In conclusion, D. hansenii could be an alternative diet for rotifer used as a live food in zebrafish larvae at the onset of exogenous feeding. The gene responses observed in this work open up the opportunity to study the effect of omega-3 supply on growth regulation in zebrafish.",

A meta-analysis was performed to assess the prognostic significance of GLUT-1 in OSCC. Electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies. The last search was updated on July 2016. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled to evaluate the relationship between GLUT-1 and clinical features and hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI were combined to measure the effect of GLUT-1 on overall survival (OS). P value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. A total of 13 studies with 1301 subjects were included for meta-analysis. The pooled data showed that high GLUT-1 expression was associated with advanced tumor stages (n = 7, OR = 2.99, 95% CI: 2.01-4.46, P < 0.001), higher tumor grade (n = 5, OR = 3.34, 95% CI: 1.12-9.94, P = 0.031), tumor size (n = 5, OR = 3.36, 95% CI: 2.04-5.51, P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (n = 5, OR = 3.15, 95% CI: 1.89-5.25, P < 0.001), tobacco use (n = 3, OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.18-4.01, P = 0.013), and distant metastasis (n = 2, OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.19-7.9, P = 0.02). Furthermore, increased GLUT-1 expression was also correlated with shorter OS (n = 8, HR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.51-2.33, P < 0.001). No significant publication bias was detected in this meta-analysis. GLUT-1 overexpression was in connection with aggressive clinical features and worse OS in OSCC. However, further studies are still needed to verify whether GLUT-1 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for OSCC.",
  "28533814": "Teenage Mothers Today: What We Know and How It Matters Over the past two decades, births to U.S. teenagers have fallen and no longer follow overall fertility patterns. Yet the unique challenges faced by teenage mothers and their families justify continued research. Across disciplines, newer work has furthered our understanding of teenage motherhood today. In this article, I highlight four areas of progress: processes of selection into teenage motherhood, the broader consequences of teenage childbearing beyond the socioeconomic realm, heterogeneity of effects, and the application of life course principles. Emerging societal trends such as complex family structures, a stalled recovery from the recession for families of low socioeconomic status, and a rapidly evolving political environment for reproductive health care continue to challenge the lives of teenage mothers. Given that the consequences for teenagers of becoming mothers may change, continued research is needed. Shifts in policy to favor supporting teenage mothers and addressing the causes of both teenage pregnancy and social disadvantage may help improve the lives of these mothers and their families.",
  "28278087": "Laccase - immobilized dendritic nanofibrous membranes as a novel approach towards the removal of bisphenol A Laccase enzymes from Rhus vernificera were covalently bound on hyperbranched polyethyleneimine / polyethersulfone (HPEI / PES) electrospun nanofibrous membranes and used for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA) from water. The laccase enzyme was anchored on the dendritic membranes through the abundant peripheral amine groups on the HPEI using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker. The membranes were characterized with attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). Furthermore, contact-angle analyses, pure water flux measurements and rejection analyses were carried out. CLEM showed that the enzymes were uniformly dispersed on the nanofibres while SEM analysis revealed that the nanofibres had an average diameter of 354 ± 37 nm. EDS showed the presence of Cu, which is the active entity in laccase enzymes. The laccase -modified membranes were hydrophilic (50°-53° contact angle) and exhibited high BPA rejection of 89.6% as compared to the 52.4% demonstrated by pristine PES. The laccase -modified membranes also maintained a constant permeate flux (7.07 ± 5.54 L/m(2) h) throughout the filtration process. Recyclability studies indicated that the membranes still maintained a high BPA removal of up to 79% even after four filtration cycles.",
  "28518216": "Queen presence mediates the relationship between collective behavior and disease susceptibility in ant colonies The success of social living can be explained, in part, by a group's ability to execute collective behaviors unachievable by solitary individuals. However, groups vary in their ability to execute these complex behaviors, often because they vary in their phenotypic composition. Group membership changes over time due to mortality or emigration, potentially leaving groups vulnerable to ecological challenges in times of flux. In some societies, the loss of important individuals (e.g., leaders, elites, queens) may have an especially detrimental effect on groups' ability to deal with these challenges. Here, we test whether the removal of queens in colonies of the acorn ant Temnothorax curvispinosus alters their ability to execute important collective behaviors and survive outbreaks of a generalist entomopathogen. We employed a split-colony design where one half of a colony was maintained with its queen, while the other half was separated from the queen. We then tested these subcolonies' performance in a series of collective behavior assays and finally exposed colonies to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii by exposing two individuals from the colony and then sealing them back into the nest. We found that queenright subcolonies outperformed their queenless counterparts in nearly all collective behaviors. Queenless subcolonies were also more vulnerable to mortality from disease. However, queenless groups that displayed more interactions with brood experienced greater survivorship, a trend not present in queenright subcolonies. Queenless subcolonies that engage in more brood interactions may have had more resources available to cope with two physiological challenges (ovarian development after queen loss and immune activation after pathogen exposure). Our results indicate that queen presence can play an integral role in colony behavior, survivorship, and their relationship. They also suggest that interactions between workers and brood are integral to colonies survival. Overall, a social group's history of social reorganization may have strong consequences on their collective behaviors and their vulnerability to disease outbreaks.

Moreover, they exhibited high tolerance to various external conditions, such as storage time, pH value, and ionic strength. The rapid detection of Hg (II) by one-step operation within 1 min and the good linear correlation between I0/I and Hg (II) concentration in the range of 10-100 nM made the nitrogen-doped CQDs a promising nanoprobe for Hg (II) detection. The detection limit of the nitrogen-doped CQDs is about 7.7 nM. Such a nanoprobe has been successfully applied for the analysis of Hg (II) in natural water samples, demonstrating excellent practical feasibility.",
  "28414203": "Self - assembled nanocomplex between polymerized phenylboronic acid and doxorubicin for efficient tumor - targeted chemotherapy Since the discovery that nano-scaled particulates can easily be incorporated into tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, such nanostructures have been exploited as therapeutic small molecule delivery systems. However, the convoluted synthetic process of conventional nanostructures has impeded their feasibility and reproducibility in clinical applications. Herein, we report an easily prepared formulation of self - assembled nanostructures for systemic delivery of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). Phenylboronic acid (PBA) was grafted onto the polymeric backbone of poly(maleic anhydride). pPBA-DOX nanocomplexes were prepared by simple mixing, on the basis of the strong interaction between the 1,3-diol of DOX and the PBA moiety on pPBA. Three nanocomplexes (1, 2, 4) were designed on the basis of [PBA]:[DOX] molar ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1, respectively, to investigate the function of the residual PBA moiety as a targeting ligand. An acid-labile drug release profile was observed, owing to the intrinsic properties of the phenylboronic ester. Moreover, the tumor - targeting ability of the nanocomplexes was demonstrated, both in vitro by confocal microscopy and in vivo by fluorescence imaging, to be driven by an inherent property of the residual PBA. Ligand competition assays with free PBA pre-treatment demonstrated the targeting effect of the residual PBA from the nanocomplexes 2 and 4. Finally, the nanocomplexes 2 and 4, compared with the free DOX, exhibited significantly greater anti-cancer effects in vitro and even in vivo. Our pPBA-DOX nanocomplex enables a new paradigm for self - assembled nanostructures with potential biomedical applications.",
  "27871172": "LIN-23, an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Component, Is Required for the Repression of CDC-25.2 Activity during Intestinal Development in Caenorhabditis elegans Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) utilizes two different cell-cycle modes, binucleations during the L1 larval stage and endoreduplications at four larval moltings, for its postembryonic intestinal development. Previous genetic studies indicated that CDC-25.2 is specifically required for binucleations at the L1 larval stage and is repressed before endoreduplications. Furthermore, LIN-23, the C. elegans β-TrCP ortholog, appears to function as a repressor of CDC-25.2 to prevent excess intestinal divisions. We previously reported that intestinal hyperplasia in lin-23 (e1883) mutants was effectively suppressed by the RNAi depletion of cdc-25.2. Nevertheless, LIN-23 targeting CDC-25.2 for ubiquitination as a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase has not yet been tested. In this study, LIN-23 is shown to be the major E3 ubiquitin ligase component, recognizing CDC-25.2 to repress their activities for proper transition of cell-cycle modes during the C. elegans postembryonic intestinal development. In addition, for the first time that LIN-23 physically interacts with both CDC-25.1 and CDC-25.2 and facilitates ubiquitination for timely regulation of their activities during the intestinal development.",

The aim of the study was to conduct a scoping review of studies into the application of or attitudes towards ehealth amongst allied health professionals conducted in Australia. Studies meeting inclusion criteria published from January 2004 to June 2015 were reviewed. Professions included were audiology, dietetics, exercise physiology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, podiatry, social work, and speech pathology. Terms for these professions and forms of ehealth were combined in databases of CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane Library, PsycINFO (1806 - Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid) and AMED (Ovid). Forty-four studies meeting inclusion criteria were summarised. They were either trials of aspects of ehealth service delivery, or clinician and/or client use of and attitudes towards ehealth. Trials of ehealth were largely from two research groups located at the Universities of Sydney and Queensland; most involved speech pathology and physiotherapy. Assessments through ehealth and intervention outcomes through ehealth were comparable with face-to-face delivery. Clinicians used ICT mostly for managing their work and for professional development, but were reticent about its use in service delivery, which contrasted with the more positive attitudes and experiences of clients. The potential of ehealth to address allied health needs of Australians living in rural and remote Australia appears unrealised. Clinicians may need to embrace ehealth as a means to radicalise practice, rather than replicate existing practices through a different mode of delivery.",

Five electronic publication databases were searched to define, describe, or categorize PHI and discuss tropical cyclone, flood, storm, tornado, and tsunami-related disasters and their impact on PHI. The data were analyzed through aggregation of individual articles to create an overall data description. The data were grouped into PHI themes, which were then prioritized on the basis of degree of interdependency. Sixty-seven relevant articles were identified. PHI was categorized into 13 themes with a total of 158 descriptors. The highest priority PHI identified was workforce. This was followed by water, sanitation, equipment, communication, physical structure, power, governance, prevention, supplies, service, transport, and surveillance. This review identified workforce as the most important of the 13 thematic areas related to PHI and disasters. If its functionality fails, workforce has the greatest impact on the performance of health services. If addressed post-disaster, the remaining forms of PHI will then be progressively addressed. These findings are a step toward providing an evidence base to inform PHI priorities in the disaster setting. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2016;10:598-610).",
  "27838149": "Radiosensitization of non-small-cell lung cancer cells and xenografts by the interactive effects of pemetrexed and methoxyamine The anti-folate pemetrexed is a radiosensitizer. In pre-clinical models, pemetrexed is more effective along with the base-excision-repair inhibitor methoxyamine. We tested whether methoxyamine enhances pemetrexed -mediated radiosensitization of lung adenocarcinoma cells and xenografts. A549 and H1299 cells were evaluated for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry, radiosensitization by clonogenic assay, and DNA repair by neutral comet assay and repair protein activation. H460 cells were included in some studies. Xenografts in nude mice received drug (s) and/or radiation, and tumor growth was monitored by caliper and in vivo toxicity by animal weight. Exposure to pemetrexed / methoxyamine for 24 (H1299, H460) or 48 (A549)hours before irradiation resulted in accumulation of cells near the radiosensitive G1/S border; dose - enhancement factors of 1.62±0.19, 1.97±0.25, and 1.67±0.30, respectively; reduction of mean inactivation dose by 32%, 30%, and 46%, respectively; and significant reductions of SF2 and SF4 (p<0.05). Radiosensitization was associated with rapid DNA double-strand-break rejoining and increased levels of DNA-PKcs. Both tumor-growth rate and tumor-growth delay were significantly improved by adding methoxyamine to pemetrexed pre-irradiation (p<0.0001); no mice lost weight during treatment. Addition of methoxyamine to pemetrexed and fractionated radiotherapy may improve outcome for patients with locally advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.",
  "27528862": "A proteomic evaluation of urinary changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass The urinary proteome of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may provide important insights into systemic and renal changes associated with the procedure. Such information may ultimately provide a basis to differentiate changes or properties associated with the development of acute kidney injury. While mass spectrometry (MS) analysis offers the potential for in-depth compositional analysis it is often limited in coverage and relative quantitation capacity. The aim of this study was to develop a process flow for the preparation and comparison of the intraoperative urinary proteome. Urines were collected from patients at the start of CPB and 1-h into CPB. Pooled samples (n = 5) from each time point were processed using a modified Filter Assisted Sample Preparation protocol. The resulting peptides were analyzed by 2D-LC-MS / MS and by 1D-LC-MS / MS SWATH (Sequential Window acquisition of All Theoretical fragment ion spectra). The 2D-LC-MS / MS analysis identified 1324 proteins in the two pools, of which 744 were quantifiable. The SWATH approach provided quantitation for 730 proteins, 552 of which overlapped with the common population from the 2D-IDA results. Intensity correlation filtering between the two methods gave 475 proteins for biological interpretation. Proteins displaying greater than threefold changes (>log2 1.59) at 1-hour CPB relative to the initiation of CPB (26 down-regulated and 22 up-regulated) were selected for further analysis. Up-regulated proteins were enriched in GO terms related to humoral immune response, predominantly innate immunity (C4b, lactotransferrin, protein S100-A8, cathelicidin, myeloperoxidase) and extracellular matrix reorganization (e.g. MMP-9). This study describes a scheme for processing urine from patients undergoing CPB for mass spectrometry -based analysis. The introduction of SWATH into the workflow offers a sample and instrument sparing approach to obtaining consistent in-depth sample analysis. The design of the methodology is such that it can be readily applied to large numbers of clinical samples with the potential for automation. The results also suggest that activation of the innate immune responses occur during cardiac bypass surgery.",

Even if the size of the nanoclusters is between 60 and 500 nm, due to their highly porous \"cauliflower\"-like structure, the porous silicon nanoparticles are composed of interconnected nanocrystals having around 2.5 nm in size and showing strong visible luminescence in the orange - red spectral region (centred at 600-700 nm). Hydrophilic behaviour and good solubility of the nanoclusters in water and water - based solutions were obtained by adding hydrogen peroxide into the etching solution during preparation and 16 min long after-bath in hydrogen peroxide. By simple filtration of the solutions with syringe filters, we have extracted smaller nanoclusters with sizes of approx. 60-70 nm; however, these nanoclusters in water and PBS solution (pH neutral) are prone to agglomeration, as was confirmed by zeta potential measurements. When the samples were left at ambient conditions for several weeks, the typical nanocluster size increased to approx. 330-400 nm and then remained stable. However, both freshly filtered and aged samples (with agglomerated porous silicon nanoparticles) of porous silicon in water and PBS solutions can be further used for biological studies or as luminescent markers in living cells.",
  "27736955": "Crystal Structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ECM4, a Xi-Class Glutathione Transferase that Reacts with Glutathionyl-(hydro)quinones Glutathionyl-hydroquinone reductases (GHRs) belong to the recently characterized Xi-class of glutathione transferases (GSTXs) according to unique structural properties and are present in all but animal kingdoms. The GHR ScECM4 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied since 1997 when it was found to be potentially involved in cell-wall biosynthesis. Up to now and in spite of biological studies made on this enzyme, its physiological role remains challenging. The work here reports its crystallographic study. In addition to exhibiting the general GSTX structural features, ScECM4 shows extensions including a huge loop which contributes to the quaternary assembly. These structural extensions are probably specific to Saccharomycetaceae. Soaking of ScECM4 crystals with GS-menadione results in a structure where glutathione forms a mixed disulfide bond with the cysteine 46. Solution studies confirm that ScECM4 has reductase activity for GS-menadione in presence of glutathione. Moreover, the high resolution structures allowed us to propose new roles of conserved residues of the active site to assist the cysteine 46 during the catalytic act.",

The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences of families receiving a nurse led pilot hospice at home programme and the experiences of healthcare professionals delivering and engaging with the programme. An exploratory, qualitative study was conducted, including telephone interviews with parents and focus groups and individual interviews with healthcare professionals. All parents of families who received the programme of care between June 2014 and September 2015 and healthcare professionals delivering and engaging with the programme were invited to participate. Seven parents participated in telephone interviews. Four focus groups took place, two with external stakeholders (18 participants in total), one with in-patient hospice staff (13 participants) and one with the hospice at home team (8 participants). Two additional interviews took place with individual stakeholders who were unable to attend a scheduled focus group. Themes from interviews with parents focused on the value of having consistent and expert care. The findings from healthcare professionals centred on communication within and across services, education and training and lone working. The pilot hospice at home programme was welcomed by all those who took part in the study. The programme may be improved by enhanced clarification of roles, enhanced access to multi-disciplinary services, greater communication across services and improved information provision to families.",

However, the cytotoxic mechanism of BRC remains unknown. Slices for immunohistochemical pathology were randomly selected from 37 paraffin-embedded prolactinoma tissue sections. LC3 was detected by immunohistochemistry. GH3 and MMQ cells were treated by BRC and/or rapamycin (RAPA). Cell viability and the cell cycle were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measured prolactin secretion. Protein expression was detected by Western blot or immunofluorescence. LC3 was significantly expressed in prolactinoma in which patients were treated exclusively with BRC. LC3 expression was negative in normal tissues and prolactinoma in which patients were not treated with BRC. Treatment with 60 μM BRC for 24 hours induced cell death in MMQ cells by up to 50%. However, 110 μM BRC was required to produce a similar effect in GH3 cells. The cell cycle was arrested at the G0 - G1 phase and S phase. As the concentration and time increased, the conversion ratio of LC3-I to LC3-II increased and prolactin secretion decreased. In addition, Bcl-2 and BAX expression was decreased. The cell viability, prolactin level, and G0-G1 cells are similar in MMQ cells treated with RAPA and a low concentration of BRC and MMQ cells treated with a high concentration of BRC. Compared with the effects of a high concentration of BRC, treatment with RAPA and a low concentration of BRC effectively increase the conversion rate of LC3-I to LC3-II. BRC - treated pituitary adenoma cells mainly underwent autophagic cell death rather than apoptosis.",
  "28377051": "Chlamydia pneumoniae infection promotes vascular endothelial cell angiogenesis through an IQGAP1 -related signaling pathway Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection plays a potential role in angiogenesis. However, it is still an enigma how C. pneumoniae is involved in this process. Therefore, we investigated the effect of C. pneumoniae infection on angiogenesis, and then explored the roles of IQGAP1 -related signaling in C. pneumoniae infection - induced angiogenesis. C. pneumoniae infection significantly enhanced angiogenesis as assessed by the tube formation assay possibly by inducing vascular endothelial cell (VEC) migration in the wound healing and Transwell migration assays. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation, Western blot and tube formation assay results showed that the phosphorylation of both IQGAP1 and N-WASP was required for the angiogenesis induced by C. pneumoniae infection. Our co-immunoprecipitation study revealed that IQGAP1 physically associated with N-WASP after C. pneumoniae infection of VECs. Actin polymerization assay further showed that in C. pneumoniae - infected VECs, both IQGAP1 and N-WASP were recruited to filamentous actin, and shared some common compartments localized at the leading edge of lamellipodia, which was impaired after the depletion of IQGAP1 by using the small interference RNA. Moreover, the knockdown of IQGAP1 also significantly decreased N-WASP phosphorylation at Tyr256 induced by C. pneumoniae infection. We conclude that C. pneumoniae infection promotes VEC migration and angiogenesis presumably through the IQGAP1 -related signaling pathway.",

However, existing methods for protein subchloroplast localization often ignore the information from these unlabeled proteins. This paper proposes a multi-label predictor based on ensemble linear neighborhood propagation (LNP), namely, LNP-Chlo, which leverages hybrid sequence-based feature information from both labeled and unlabeled proteins for predicting localization of both single- and multi-label chloroplast proteins. Experimental results on a stringent benchmark dataset and a novel independent dataset suggest that LNP-Chlo performs at least 6% (absolute) better than state-of-the-art predictors. This paper also demonstrates that ensemble LNP significantly outperforms LNP based on individual features.

Single-phase and Janus hydrogel microparticles were both generated using a centrifugal microfluidic chip. For glucose sensing, concanavalin A and fluorescein labeled dextran used for competitive binding assay were encapsulated in alginate microparticles, and the fluorescence of the microparticles was positively correlated with glucose concentration. For cholesterol sensing, the microparticles embedded with γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were used as catalyst for the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine by H2O2, an enzymatic hydrolysis product of cholesterol. And the color transition was more sensitive in the microparticles than in solutions, indicating the microparticles are more applicable for visualized determination. Furthermore, Janus microparticles were employed for multitarget sensing in the two hemespheres, and glucose and cholesterol were detected within the same microparticles without obvious interference. Besides, the particles could be manipulated by an external magnetic field. The glucose and cholesterol levels were measured in human serum utilizing the microparticles, which confirmed the potential application of the microparticles in real sample detection.",
  "28263181": "The cancer Warburg effect may be a testable example of the minimum entropy production rate principle Cancer cells consume more glucose by glycolytic fermentation to lactate than by respiration, a characteristic known as the Warburg effect. In contrast with the 34 moles of ATP produced by respiration, fermentation produces two moles of ATP per mole of glucose consumed, which poses a puzzle on the function of the Warburg effect. Productions of free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) per mole linearly vary with the fraction (x) of glucose consumed by fermentation that is frequently estimated around 0.9. Hence, calculation shows that, in respect to pure respiration, the predominant fermentative metabolism decreases around 10% the production of entropy per mole of glucose consumed in cancer cells. We hypothesize that increased fermentation could allow cancer cells to accomplish the Prigogine theorem of the trend to minimize the rate of production of entropy. According the theorem, open cellular systems near the steady state could evolve to minimize the rates of entropy production that may be reached by modified replicating cells producing entropy at low rate. Remarkably, at CO2 concentrations above 930 ppm, glucose respiration produces less entropy than fermentation, which suggests experimental tests to validate the hypothesis of minimization of the rate of entropy production through the Warburg effect.",
  "27832159": "A Novel Selective Inhibitor of Delta-5 Desaturase Lowers Insulin Resistance and Reduces Body Weight in Diet -Induced Obese C57BL/6J Mice Obesity is now recognized as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and is called as metabolic inflammation. Delta-5 desaturase (D5D) is an enzyme that metabolizes dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA) to arachidonic acid (AA). Thus, D5D inhibition increases DGLA (precursor to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids) while decreasing AA (precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids), and could result in synergistic improvement in the low-grade inflammatory state. Here, we demonstrate reduced insulin resistance and the anti-obesity effect of a D5D selective inhibitor (compound-326), an orally active small-molecule, in a high-fat diet -induced obese (DIO) mouse model. In vivo D5D inhibition was confirmed by determining changes in blood AA / DGLA profiles. In DIO mice, chronic treatment with compound-326 lowered insulin resistance and caused body weight loss without significant impact on cumulative calorie intake. Decreased macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue was expected from mRNA analysis. Increased daily energy expenditure was also observed following administration of compound-326, in line with sustained body weight loss. These data indicate that the novel D5D selective inhibitor, compound-326, will be a new class of drug for the treatment of obese and diabetic patients.",
  "27454379": "How Can We Estimate Sepsis Incidence and Mortality? Sepsis is one of the oldest and complex syndromes in medicine that has been in debate for over two millennia. Valid and comparable data on the population burden of sepsis constitute an essential resource for guiding health policy and resource allocation. Despite current epidemiological data suggesting that the global burden of sepsis is huge, the knowledge of its incidence, prevalence, mortality, and case-fatality rates is subject to several flaws. The objective of this narrative review is to assess how sepsis incidence and mortality can be estimated, providing examples on how it has been done so far in medical literature and discussing its possible biases. Results of recent studies suggest that sepsis incidence rates are increasing consistently during the last decades. Although estimates might be biased, this probably reflects a real increase in incidence over time. Nevertheless, case fatality rates have decreased, which is a probable reflex of advances in critical care provision to this very sick population at high risk of death. This conclusion can only be drawn with a reasonable degree of certainty for high-income countries. Conversely, adequately designed studies from middle - and low-income countries are urgently needed. In these countries, sepsis incidence and case-fatality rates could be disproportionally higher due to health care provision constraints and ineffective preventive measures.",

This randomized crossover trial took place at three tertiary care hospitals and a seniors' center. Participants were aged ≥55 years without significant physical limitations (frailty score ≤3/7). They completed two 5-minute CPR sessions (using 30:2 and CCC) on manikins; sessions were separated by a rest period. We used concealed block randomization to determine CPR method order. Metronome feedback maintained a compression rate of 100/minute. We measured heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and Borg Exertion Scale. CPR quality measures included total number of compressions and number of adequate compressions (depth ≥5 cm). Sixty-three participants were enrolled: mean age 70.8 years, female 66.7%, past CPR training 60.3%. Bystander fatigue was similar between CPR methods: mean difference in HR -0.59 (95% CI -3.51-2.33), MAP 1.64 (95% CI -0.23-3.50), and Borg 0.46 (95% CI 0.07-0.84). Compared to 30:2, participants using CCC performed more chest compressions (480.0 v. 376.3, mean difference 107.7; p<0.0001) and more adequate chest compressions (381.5 v. 324.9, mean difference. 62.0; p=0.0001), although good compressions/minute declined significantly faster with the CCC method (p=0.0002). CPR quality decreased significantly faster when performing CCC compared to 30:2. However, performing CCC produced more adequate compressions overall with a similar level of fatigue compared to the 30:2 method.",
  "27446916": "Personalized Medicine Approaches in Prostate Cancer Employing Patient Derived 3D Organoids and Humanized Mice Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer death in Western men. Despite its prevalence, PCa has proven very difficult to propagate in vitro. PCa represents a complex organ-like multicellular structure maintained by the dynamic interaction of tumoral cells with parenchymal stroma, endothelial and immune cells, and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The lack of PCa models that recapitulate this intricate system has hampered progress toward understanding disease progression and lackluster therapeutic responses. Tissue slices, monolayer cultures and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) fail to mimic the complexities of the PCa microenvironment or reproduce the diverse mechanisms of therapy resistance. Moreover, patient derived xenografts (PDXs) are expensive, time consuming, difficult to establish for prostate cancer, lack immune cell-tumor regulation, and often tumors undergo selective engraftments. Here, we describe an interdisciplinary approach using primary PCa and tumor initiating cells (TICs), three-dimensional (3D) tissue engineering, genetic and morphometric profiling, and humanized mice to generate patient - derived organoids for examining personalized therapeutic responses in vitro and in mice co-engrafted with a human immune system (HIS), employing adaptive T-cell- and chimeric antigen receptor- (CAR) immunotherapy.

The literature on straight configuration saphenous vein transposition to the popliteal artery is scarce. Here we present two cases of straight configuration saphenous vein transposition to the popliteal artery for vascular access, the surgical technique and respective follow-up. Two young men, aged 29 and 36 years, were chosen for lower-limb vascular access for hemodialysis. The first patient was paraplegic since birth. He used his arms to move so upper extremity vascular access was avoided. The second patient presented with an infected upper extremity arteriovenous graft (AVG) and after multiple closed AVFs he had no more available arm veins. Both patients received autologous lower extremity straight configuration saphenous vein transpositions to the popliteal artery under spinal anesthesia in May and October 2012, respectively. Cannulation of the fistula was allowed after one month. There were no early complications. Slight swelling on the leg appeared in one of the patients. Both fistulas were still functional after 36 and 32 months, respectively. The straight configuration saphenous vein transposition to popliteal artery is simple to perform, offers a long and straight segment for cannulation and may be a suitable autologous vascular access in selected patients.",

Data relevant for the medical care of patients with PPP are scarce. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the disease burden, clinical characteristics, and comorbidity of PPP patients in Germany. PPP patients were examined in a crosssectional study at seven specialized psoriasis centers in Germany. Of the 172 included patients with PPP, 79.1% were female and 69.8% were smokers .In addition, 25.0% suffered from psoriasis vulgaris, 28.2% had documented psoriatic arthritis, and 30.2% had a family history of psoriasis. In 77 patients the mean Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was 12.2 ± 7.7 (mean ± SD). The mean Psoriasis Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) was 12.6 ± 8.6. Mean body mass index was above average at 27.1 ± 5.5. The PPP patients had previously received an average of 2.6 ± 2.1 different anti-psoriatic systemic drugs or UV-therapies. The systemic drugs that had been used most frequently were corticosteroids in 40.1% of patients, followed by acitretin (37.8%), and methotrexate (27.9%). The PPPASI was 13.4 ± 8.9 in patients without current systemic therapy and 10.4 ± 7.9 in patients with systemic therapy. Many PPP patients had a concomitant diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris and/or psoriatic arthritis or had a family history of psoriasis. Despite the fact that many of the patients were using anti-psoriatic therapies, there was still a high burden of disease within this PPP cohort. This insufficient control of symptoms demonstrates the urgent need for new PPP treatments.",

Fyn plays a critical role in neuronal migration, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we reported that suppression of Fyn expression in mouse cerebral cortex led to migration defects of both early-born and late-born neurons. Morphological analysis showed that loss of Fyn function impaired multipolar - bipolar transition of newly generated neurons and neurite formation in the early phase of migration. Moreover, Fyn inhibition increased the length of leading process and decreased the branching number of the migrating cortical neurons. Together, these results indicate that Fyn controls neuronal migration by regulating the cytoskeletal dynamics and multipolar - bipolar transition of newly generated neurons during cortical development.",

Method A total of 152 women were analyzed. The instruments used were the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ [Area 4]) to check the level of physical activity, and the Diagnostic Form to obtain sociodemographic data and presence of urinary incontinence. To calculate the conicity index, waist to height ratio and fat percentage, body mass, height and waist circumference were measured. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used. Cutoff points, sensitivity (S) and specificity (SP) were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A 5% significance level was adopted. Results The prevalence of urinary incontinence was of 32.2%. The cutoff point with better sensitivity and specificity for the conicity index was 1.23 (S = 87.8; SP = 35.9); for the waist to height ratio, it was 0.57 (S = 79.6; SP = 45.6); and for the fat percentage, it was 39.71 (S = 89.8; SP = 42.7). The area under the ROC curve was 0.666 for the conicity index, 0.653 for the waist to height ratio, and 0.660 for the fat percentage. Conclusions The cutoff points for the anthropometric measurements conicity index, waist to height ratio and fat percentage indicate that these measures can be used to predict urinary incontinence in physically active older women. Furthermore, fat percentage seemed to be the best measure for this population.",
  "27821673": "Effect of Core Stability Training on Trunk Function, Standing Balance, and Mobility in Stroke Patients Trunk function is important for standing balance, mobility, and functional outcome after stroke, but few studies have evaluated the effects of exercises aimed at improving core stability in stroke patients. To investigate the effectiveness of core stability training on trunk function, standing balance, and mobility in stroke patients. An assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial was undertaken in a stroke rehabilitation ward, with 32 participants randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group (n = 16 each). The experimental group received 400 minutes of core stability training in place of conventional programs within total training time, while the control group received only conventional programs. Primary outcome measures were evaluated using the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), which reflects trunk function. Secondary outcome measures were evaluated by pelvic tilt active range of motion in the sagittal plane, the Balance Evaluation Systems Test-brief version (Brief-BESTest), Functional Reach test, Timed Up-and-Go test (TUG), and Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC). A general linear repeated-measures model was used to analyze the results. A treatment effect was found for the experimental group on the dynamic balance subscale and total score of the TIS (P = .002 and P < .001, respectively), pelvic tilt active range of motion (P < .001), Brief-BESTest (P < .001), TUG (P = .008), and FAC (P = .022). Core stability training has beneficial effects on trunk function, standing balance, and mobility in stroke patients. Our findings might provide support for introducing core stability training in stroke rehabilitation.",
  "27412144": "Nonstenotic carotid plaque on CT angiography in patients with cryptogenic stroke To determine whether large (≥3 mm thick) but nonstenotic (<50%) carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque predominantly occurs ipsilateral rather than contralateral to cryptogenic stroke. This was a cross-sectional observational study. Using a stroke registry, we identified consecutive patients with anterior circulation embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Using CT angiography, we measured carotid plaque size (thickness, mm) and carotid artery stenosis (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method) for each patient. We dichotomized plaque size at several predefined thresholds and calculated the frequency of plaque size above each threshold ipsilateral vs contralateral to stroke. We included 85 patients with ESUS. Plaque with thickness ≥5 mm was present ipsilateral to stroke in 11% of patients, and contralateral in 1% (9/85 vs 1/85; p = 0.008). Plaque with thickness ≥4 mm was present ipsilateral to stroke in 19% of patients, and contralateral in 5% (16/85 vs 4/85; p = 0.002). Plaque with thickness ≥3 mm was present ipsilateral to stroke in 35% of patients, and contralateral in 15% (30/85 vs 13/85; p = 0.001). There was no difference in percentage stenosis ipsilateral vs contralateral to stroke (p = 0.98), and weak correlation between plaque size and stenosis (R(2) = 0.26, p < 0.001). Large but nonstenotic carotid artery plaque is considerably more common ipsilateral than contralateral to cryptogenic stroke, suggesting that nonstenotic plaque is an underrecognized cause of stroke. We measured plaque size using CT angiography, a method that could be easily implemented in clinical practice.",

MCT was administered to BALB/c Slc-nu/nu mice, and PH was induced in mice 4 weeks later. Fresh hUCB - MNCs harvested from a human donor after her delivery were injected intravenously into those PH mice. The medial thickness of pulmonary arterioles, ratio of right ventricular to septum plus left ventricular weight (RV / S + LV), and ratio of acceleration time to ejection time of pulmonary blood flow waveform (AT / ET) were determined 4 weeks after hUCB - MNC transplantation. To reveal the incorporation into the lung, CMTMR - labeled hUCB - MNCs were observed in the lung by fluorescent microscopy. DiR-labeled hUCB - MNCs were detected in the lung and other organs by bioluminescence images. Medial thickness, RV / S + LV and AT / ET were significantly improved 4 weeks after hUCB - MNC transplantation compared with those in mice without hUCB - MNC transplantation. CMTMR - positive hUCB - MNCs were observed in the lung 3 hours after transplantation. Bioluminescence signals were detected more strongly in the lung than in other organs for 24 hours after transplantation. The results indicate that hUCB - MNCs are incorporated into the lung early after hUCB - MNC transplantation and improve MCT - induced PH. J. Med. Invest. 64: 43-49, February, 2017.",
  "27418869": "Dental Students ' Educational Environment and Perceived Stress: The University of Malaya Experience An equitable and positive learning environment fosters deep self-directed learning in students and, consequently, good practice in their profession. Although demotivating weaknesses may lead to repeated day-to-day stress with a cascade of deleterious consequences at both personal and professional levels, a possible relationship between these parameters has not been reported. This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between students ' perceptions of their educational environment and their stress levels. Sixty-one first year students at the Dental Faculty, University of Malaya, Malaysia participated. The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) was used to determine educational environment while self-rated perceived stress level was measured by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). Most students (62.39%) showed positive perceptions for the total and five domains of DREEM. The highest percentage was observed for \" Students perception of learning \" (64.04%) while the lowest was for \" Students ' social self- perception \" (60.32%). At the same time, 61% of students showed high perceived stress levels. However, this was not associated with their DREEM scores. Although a positive perception of their educational environment was found, minor corrective measures need to be implemented. Furthermore, longitudinal studies on an annual basis would provide useful input for strategic planning purposes.",
  "27297967": "Arsenic Triglutathione [As(GS)3] Transport by Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 (MRP1 / ABCC1) Is Selectively Modified by Phosphorylation of Tyr920/Ser921 and Glycosylation of Asn19/Asn23 The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1 / ABCC1) is responsible for the cellular export of a chemically diverse array of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Arsenic, a human carcinogen, is a high-affinity MRP1 substrate as arsenic triglutathione [As(GS)3]. In this study, marked differences in As(GS)3 transport kinetics were observed between MRP1 -enriched membrane vesicles prepared from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) (Km 3.8 µM and Vmax 307 pmol/mg per minute) and HeLa (Km 0.32 µM and Vmax 42 pmol/mg per minute) cells. Mutant MRP1 lacking N-linked glycosylation [Asn19/23/1006Gln; sugar-free (SF)-MRP1] expressed in either HEK293 or HeLa cells had low Km and Vmax values for As(GS)3, similar to HeLa wild-type (WT) MRP1. When prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, both WT- and SF-MRP1 -enriched membrane vesicles had a high Km value for As(GS)3 (3-6 µM), regardless of the cell line. Kinetic parameters of As(GS)3 for HEK - Asn19/23Gln-MRP1 were similar to those of HeLa / HEK - SF-MRP1 and HeLa-WT - MRP1, whereas those of single glycosylation mutants were like those of HEK-WT -MRP1. Mutation of 19 potential MRP1 phosphorylation sites revealed that HEK - Tyr920Phe/Ser921Ala-MRP1 transported As(GS)3 like HeLa-WT - MRP1, whereas individual HEK - Tyr920Phe- and - Ser921Ala-MRP1 mutants were similar to HEK-WT - MRP1. Together, these results suggest that Asn19/Asn23 glycosylation and Tyr920/Ser921 phosphorylation are responsible for altering the kinetics of MRP1 -mediated As(GS)3 transport. The kinetics of As(GS)3 transport by HEK - Asn19/23Gln/Tyr920Glu/Ser921Glu were similar to HEK-WT - MRP1, indicating that the phosphorylation -mimicking substitutions abrogated the influence of Asn19/23Gln glycosylation. Overall, these data suggest that cross-talk between MRP1 glycosylation and phosphorylation occurs and that phosphorylation of Tyr920 and Ser921 can switch MRP1 to a lower-affinity, higher-capacity As(GS)3 transporter, allowing arsenic detoxification over a broad concentration range.",
  "27965563": "Functional Connectivity Reveals Which Language the \" Control Regions \" Control during Bilingual Production Bilingual studies have revealed critical roles for the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the left caudate nucleus (Lcaudate) in controlling language processing, but how these regions manage activation of a bilingual 's two language s remains an open question. We addressed this question by identifying the functional connectivity (FC) of these control regions during a picture - naming task by bimodal bilinguals who were fluent in both a spoken and a signed language. To quantify language control processes, we measured the FC of the dACC and Lcaudate with a region specific to each language modality: left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG) for speech and left pre/postcentral gyrus (LPCG) for sign. Picture - naming occurred in either a single - or dual - language context. The results showed that in a single - language context, the dACC exhibited increased FC with the target language region, but not with the non-target language region. During the dual - language context when both languages were alternately the target language, the dACC showed strong FC to the LPCG, the region specific to the less proficien t (signed) language. By contrast, the Lcaudate revealed a strong connectivity to the LPCG in the single - language context and to the LSTG (the region specific to spoken language) in the dual - language context. Our findings suggest that the dACC monitors and supports the processing of the target language, and that the Lcaudate controls the selection of the less accessible language. The results support the hypothesis that language control processes adapt to task demands that vary due to different interactional contexts.",
  "28181679": "Mechanism of motor coordination of masseter and temporalis muscles for increased masticatory efficiency in mice The demand for the use of mice as animal models for elucidating the pathophysiologies and pathogeneses of oral motor disorders has been increasing in recent years, as more and more kinds of genetically modified mice that express functional disorders of the stomatognathic system become available. However, the fundamental characteristics of mouse jaw movements during mastication have yet to be fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of the masseter and temporalis muscles, and the mechanisms of motor coordination of these muscles for increasing masticatory efficiency in the closing phase in mice. Twenty-two male Jcl: ICR mice were divided into control (n = 8), masseter-hypofunction (n = 7) and temporalis - hypofunction groups (n = 7). Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT⁄A) was used to induce muscle hypofunction. The masticatory movement path in the horizontal direction during the occlusal phase became unstable after BoNT⁄A injection into the masseter muscle. BoNT⁄A injection into the temporalis muscle decreased antero-posterior excursion of the late-closing phase corresponding to the power phase of the chewing cycle. These results suggest that the masseter plays an important role in stabilizing the grinding path, where the food bolus is ground by sliding the posterior teeth from back to front during the occlusal phase. The temporalis plays a major role in retracting the mandible more posteriorly in the early phase of closing, extending the grinding path. Masticatory efficiency is thus increased based on the coordination of activities by the masseter and temporalis muscles.",
  "27784873": "ATP release from bladder urothelium and serosa in a rat model of partial bladder outlet obstruction Overactive bladder is one of the major health problem especially in elderly people. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is released from urinary bladder cells and acts as a smooth muscle contraction and sensory signal in micturition but little is known about the role of ATP release in the pathophysiology of overactive bladder. To assess the relationship between ATP and overactive bladder, we used a partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO) model in rats. The bladder caused several changes by pBOO: An increase in bladder weight, hypertrophy of sub-urothelium and sub-serosal area, and frequent non - voiding bladder contraction during urine storage. Basal ATP release from urothelium and serosa of pBOO rats was significantly higher than that of normal rats. Distention induced ATP release from urothelium of normal and pBOO rats had no significant change. However, distention - induced ATP release from serosa of pBOO rats was higher than that of normal. These findings may identify ATP especially released from serosa as one of causes of non - voiding contractions and overactive bladder symptoms.",
  "28356547": "Mechanisms of iPS cell generation and beyond The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) achieved by overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, transformed our classical views of the cellular epigenetic landscape and delivered a new concept for cell and tissue engineering. In addition to iPSCs, several other cell types have also been generated by master transcription factor (TF)-mediated transdifferentiation. However, the critical molecular mechanisms amongst diverse cellular identity changes are not well understood. Through the investigation of reprogramming mechanisms, we recently revealed that over-expression of constitutive active Smad3 boosted not only iPSC generation, but also 3 other master TF -mediated conversions, from B cells to macrophages, myoblasts to adipocytes, and human fibroblasts to neurons. This demonstrated that there were common mechanisms underlying different master TF -mediated cell conversions. To illuminate such mechanisms further, we have recently performed CRISPR/Cas9 -mediated genome-wide knockout screening during reprogramming with a lentiviral gRNA library containing 90,000 gRNAs. This screening provided us with ~15 novel reprogramming roadblock genes as well as ~20 candidate genes essential for the reprogramming process but not for ES cell self-renewa l. This data set will be a valuable resource to further understand how overexpression of master TFs alters cellular identity, and to achieve more faithful, efficient cell conversions for regenerative medicine .(Presented at the 1934th Meeting, March 17, 2017).",

However, little is known about the pathophysiological alterations of corpus cavernosum in sickle cell disease. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the functional and molecular alterations of sympathetic machinery and nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling pathway in Townes transgenic sickle cell disease mice. Concentration-response curves to contractile (phenylephrine) and relaxant agents (acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside) were obtained in corpus cavernosum strips from sickle and C57BL/6 (control) mice. Neurogenic contractions and nitrergic relaxations were obtained using electrical-field stimulation. Measurements of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) and α1A-, α1B- and α1D-adrenoceptor mRNA expressions and reactive-oxygen species were performed. Tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylated at Ser-31 and total tyrosine hydroxylase protein expressions in cavernosal tissues were also measured. The neurogenic contractions were higher in the sickle cell disease group, in association with elevated tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylated at Ser-31 and total tyrosine hydroxylase protein expression, as well as increased tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression. Likewise, phenylephrine - induced contractions were greater in the sickle mice, whereas α1A-, α1B- and α1D-adrenoceptor mRNA expression remained unchanged. Cavernosal relaxations to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and EFS were higher in sickle mice, accompanied by decreased eNOS and nNOS, along with lower PDE5 mRNA expression. An increase of about 40% in reactive-oxygen species generation in corpus cavernosum from sickle mice was also detected. Our study shows that decreased nitric oxide bioavailability in erectile tissue due to increased oxidative stress leads to both sympathetic hyperactivity and dysregulation of nitric oxide signaling in corpus cavernosum from Townes sickle mice.",

After transfer between farms, high mortality was observed in fish, associated with back arching, abnormal swimming, and ulcerative skin lesions. Necropsy of moribund individuals revealed hemorrhagic ascites and petechial hemorrhages in the coelomic peritoneum and serosa of internal organs. Acipenserid herpesvirus 2 (AciHV-2) was isolated from external tissue samples, then identified and genotyped by sequencing of the terminase and polymerase genes. In addition, Streptococcus iniae was recovered from internal organs of affected fish. Histologic changes were limited to interstitial hematopoietic areas of the kidney and consisted of small foci of necrosis accompanied by fibrin deposition, minimal inflammatory response, and small numbers of bacterial cocci compatible with streptococci. Identity was confirmed by partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA, rpoB, and gyrB genes. Genetic fingerprinting demonstrated a genetic profile distinct from S. iniae isolates recovered from previous outbreaks in wild and cultured fish in North America, South America, and the Caribbean. Although the isolates were resistant to white sturgeon complement in serum killing assays, in vivo challenges failed to fulfill Koch's postulates. However, the clinical presentation, coupled with consistent recovery of S. iniae and AciHV-2 from moribund fish, suggests viral and bacterial co-infection were the proximate cause of death. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of AciHV-2 and S. iniae co-infection in cultured white sturgeon.",
  "27988278": "Right Ventricular Response During Exercise in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Right ventricular (RV) pump function is of essential clinical and prognostic importance in a variety of heart and lung diseases. While the evaluation of RV performance at rest has been implemented in the clinical setting, it is unknown whether this assessment during exercise may provide additional benefit. With this aim, we evaluated the exercise - induced pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) increase during exercise in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an expression of RV contractile reserve. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with synchronic echocardiography was performed in 81 patients. Patients were classified into two groups according to an exercise - induced PASP increase above 30mmHg (High PSAP) or below 30mmHg (Low PSAP) during maximal exercise. Patients were then followed for three years. Sixteen patients (20%) had low PSAP and 65 (80%) showed high PSAP. These were not significant clinical and functional differences. Low PSAP was associated with a significantly lower peak VO2 (mean (SD), 35 (2) % predicted) compared to high PSAP response (peak VO2 45 (3) % predicted), p=0.045. Factors associated with mortality were age and exercise - induced PASP. Seventeen patients died during the three years of follow-up (7 (39%) in the low PSAP group and only 10 (1%) in the high PSAP group, p=0.041). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with a synchronic echocardiography may be a useful tool for the assessment of RV contractile reserve in severe COPD patients. Exercise - induced PSAP emerges as a possible prognostic factor in these patients.",

There is, however, limited research providing a comprehensive MSK pain profile of an obese cohort. This retrospective study utilized a patient database at a national weight management service (WMS). Following ethical approval, anonymized patient data were statistically analyzed to develop a pain profile, investigate relationships between pain, sleep, and function, and explore variables associated with having low back pain (LBP) and knee pain. Overall, 915 individuals attended the WMS from January 2011 to September 2015 [male, 35% (n=318; CI =32-38); female, 65% (n=597; CI =62-68); mean age 44.6]. Mean BMI was 50.7 kg/m2 [Class III obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m2), 92% (n=835; CI =91-94)]. Approximately 91% reported MSK pain: LBP, 69% (n=539; CI =65- 72) [mean NRS 7.4]; knee pain, 58% (n=447; CI =55-61) [mean NRS 6.8]. Class III obese and multi-site pain patients had lower QoL and physical activity levels, reduced sleep, and poorer physical function than less obese patients and those without pain (p<0.05). Relationships were found between demographic, pain, self-report, psychological, and functional measures (p<0.05). Patients who slept fewer hours and had poorer functional outcomes were more likely to have LBP; patients who were divorced, had lower QoL, and more frequent nocturia were more likely to have knee pain (p<0.05). Multi-site MSK pain is prevalent and severe in obese patients and is negatively associated with most self-report and functional outcomes. This high prevalence suggests pain management strategies must be considered when treating obesity.",

We present pulsed double electron-electron resonance measurements of two key fibril - forming regions of tau, PHF6 and PHF6*, in transient as aggregation happens. By monitoring the end-to-end distance distribution of these segments as a function of aggregation time, we show that the PHF6((*)) regions dramatically extend to distances commensurate with extended β-strand structures within the earliest stages of aggregation, well before fibril formation.

  "27995510": "Mechanisms of Global Cerebral Edema Formation in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage A growing body of clinical literature emphasizes the impact of cerebral edema in early brain injury following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Aneurysm rupture itself initiates global cerebral edema in up to two thirds of cases. Although cerebral edema is not a universal feature of aSAH, it portends a poor clinical course, with quantitative analysis revealing a direct correlation between cerebral edema and poor outcome, including mortality and cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, global cerebral edema has been linked to global ischemia at the time of aneurysm rupture, dysfunction of autoregulation, blood breakdown products, neuroinflammation, and hyponatremia / endocrine abnormalities. At a molecular level, several culprits have been identified, including aquaporin-4, matrix metalloproteinase-9, SUR1 - TRPM4 cation channels, vascular endothelial growth factor, bradykinin, and others. Here, we review these cellular and molecular mechanisms of global cerebral edema formation in aSAH. Given the importance of edema to the outcome of patients with aSAH and its status as a highly modifiable pathological process, a better understanding of cerebral edema in aSAH promises to hasten the development of medical therapies to improve outcomes in this frequently devastating disease.",

Endothelial cells can use a number of different pathways to cause angiogenesis and each step in these pathways can be targeted. The use of multi targeted drugs is gaining much importance in this scenario. Our previous results have shown the anti angiogenic effect of Chebulagic acid - a benzopyran tannin present in the fruits of Terminalia chebula. The present study was designed to examine the molecular mechanism of the anti angiogenic effect of chebulagic acid. Results of our investigations using molecular docking studies and HUVECs in culture suggested that Chebulagic acid inhibited GSK-3β dependent β-catenin phosphorylation, an important mediator of VE-cadherin / β-catenin signaling and VEGFR2 phosphorylation which is an important step involved in VEGF signaling. Chebulagic acid inhibits angiogenesis by blocking both VEGF / VEGFR2 and cell-cell contact dependent downstream signaling pathway.",
  "27787956": "Relative importance of climate and mountain pine beetle outbreaks on the occurrence of large wildfires in the western USA Extensive outbreaks of bark beetles have killed trees across millions of hectares of forests and woodlands in western North America. These outbreaks have led to spirited scientific, public, and policy debates about consequential increases in fire risk, especially in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where homes and communities are at particular risk from wildfires. At the same time, large wildfires have become more frequent across this region. Widespread expectations that outbreaks increase extent, severity, and/or frequency of wildfires are based partly on visible and dramatic changes in foliar moisture content and other fuel properties following outbreaks, as well as associated modeling projections. A competing explanation is that increasing wildfires are driven primarily by climatic extremes, which are becoming more common with climate change. However, the relative importance of bark beetle outbreaks vs. climate on fire occurrence has not been empirically examined across very large areas and remains poorly understood. The most extensive outbreaks of tree - killing insects across the western United States have been of mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae), which have killed trees over >650,000 km(2), mostly in forests dominated by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). We show that outbreaks of MPB in lodgepole pine forests of the western United States have been less important than climatic variability for the occurrence of large fires over the past 29 years. In lodgepole pine forests in general, as well as those in the WUI, occurrence of large fires was determined primarily by current and antecedent high temperatures and low precipitation but was unaffected by preceding outbreaks. Trends of increasing co-occurrence of wildfires and outbreaks are due to a common climatic driver rather than interactions between these disturbances. Reducing wildfire risk hinges on addressing the underlying climatic drivers rather than treating beetle -affected forests.",

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of crown fracture in the primary dentition over a 1-year follow-up period, identify risk factors, and test the hypothesis that children with previous crown fracture are more prone to experience further cases of crown fracture independently of other risk factors. This study was developed in two phases: cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal study. The cross-sectional study was carried out 261 preschool children. The prospective longitudinal study was carried out 194 children allocated to two groups: exposed group (children with prior exposure to crown fracture) and non - exposed group (children without prior exposure). On both occasions, children were examined for the diagnosis of crown fracture and evaluation of lip coverage and overjet. The parents were interviewed with regard to the socioeconomic indicators. New cases of crown fracture were identified based on the comparison of the two examinations. Data analysis involved Pearson's chi-square test, McNemar's test, and Poisson regression with robust variance. Among the 261 children who participated in the cross-sectional study, 194 were re-examined (65 in the exposed group and 129 in the non - exposed group). The overall incidence of crown fracture was 55.7% (n = 108). The difference in percentage of increased risk of crown fracture in exposed and non - exposed groups was 13.4%. A greater incidence of crown fracture was found in the exposed group (64.6%; P < 0,001). The children exposed (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.01-1.67) had a greater risk of developing new cases of crown fracture in comparison with the non - exposed group. The incidence of crown fracture was high and children with previous crown fracture had a greater risk of suffering new cases of crown fracture during the 1-year follow-up period.",

To determine current treatment options of chronic low back pain (LBP) as defined by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to compare effectiveness of those treatments using a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC). It is important to provide an evidence-based assessment of the treatment options that exist for LBP. A systematic search of RCTs was conducted in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library from 1990 to 2014. From the selected studies, we extracted preoperative and postoperative ODI and VAS back pain scores, additional surgeries, and complications. Standard and network meta-analytic techniques were used. Twelve RCTs were included in the analysis: 5 total disk replacement (TDR) versus fusion; 1 TDR versus exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); 5 fusion versus exercise and CBT; and 1 fusion versus physical therapy (PT). On the basis of MTC, with respect to ODI change scores, the pooled mean difference favoring fusion over exercise and CBT was 2.0 points (95% CI, -1.2 to 4.8). The pooled mean difference favoring TDR over exercise and CBT was 6.4 points (95% CI, 3.2-9.3). The pooled mean difference favoring fusion over PT was 8.8 points (95% CI, 4.1-13.6). The pooled mean differences favoring TDR over fusion was 4.4 points (95% CI, 2.37-6.63). For PT versus structured exercise with CBT, the pooled mean difference favoring exercise with CBT over PT was 6.8 points (95% CI, 1.5-12.8). For TDR versus PT, the pooled mean difference favoring TDR over PT was 13.2 points (95% CI, 8.0-18.4). Additional surgery rates were similar between treatment options. All 4 treatments provided some benefit to patients with chronic LBP. According to the MTC analysis, TDR may be the most effective treatment and PT the least effective treatment for chronic LBP.

CAMHS transitions are often poorly managed with negative outcomes for young people. Better preparation may improve outcomes and experience. This study aimed to co-produce, with young people who had transitioned or were facing transition from CAMHS, a CAMHS Transition Preparation Programme (TPP), deliverable in routine NHS settings. Eighteen young people, aged 17-22, from three UK National Health Service (NHS) mental health foundation trusts participated in creative, participatory research workshops. Seven parents completed short questionnaires. Thirty clinical staff from two trusts took part in workshops to ensure deliverability of young people's ideas. Young people were offered co-research opportunities. Most young people felt anxious, fearful and uncertain on leaving CAMHS and perceived mental health services as uncaring. Participants outlined transition procedures and drafted a range of preparation activities, centred around dedicated Transition Peer Support and a transition booklet, which should be offered to all CAMHS leavers, irrespective of discharge or transfer to an adult service. Preparation should aim to build confidence to help young people take responsibility for themselves and flourish in the adult world: coping or getting through it was not enough. Some clinicians also felt anxious at transition and recognised the potential impact on young people of poor communication and lack of understanding between services. Parents would appreciate help to support their offspring during the transition period. Clinicians cited lack of funding and inflexible NHS procedures and policies as potential barriers to the implementation of young people's ideas. Nine young people took up co-research opportunities. Mental health services underestimate the anxiety of CAMHS leavers. Young people have clear ideas about the preparation they require to leave CAMHS with the confidence to take responsibility for their own health care. Close collaboration of NHS staff and researchers facilitates the implementation of research findings.",
  "27744641": "Somatosensory regulation of serotonin release in the central nucleus of the amygdala is mediated via corticotropin releasing factor and gamma-aminobutyric acid in the dorsal raphe nucleus Noxious cutaneous stimulation increases, whereas innocuous cutaneous stimulation decreases serotonin (5-HT) release in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in anesthetized rats. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptors and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) to those responses. Release of 5-HT in the CeA was monitored by microdialysis before and after 10- min stimulation by pinching or stroking. Increased 5-HT release in the CeA in response to pinching was abolished by CRF2 receptor antagonism in the DRN. Decreased 5-HT release in the CeA in response to stroking was abolished by either CRF1 receptor antagonism or GABAA receptor antagonism in the DRN. These results suggest that opposite responses of 5-HT release in the CeA to noxious versus innocuous stimulation of the skin are due to separate contributions of CRF2, CRF1 and GABAA receptors in the DRN.",
  "27544926": "Folate - conjugated gene - carrying microbubbles with focused ultrasound for concurrent blood-brain barrier opening and local gene delivery Previous studies have demonstrated that circulating DNA - encapsulated microbubbles (MBs) combined with focused ultrasound (FUS) can be used for local blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening and gene delivery. However, few studies focused on how to increase the efficiency of gene delivery to brain tumors after the released gene penetrating the BBB. Here, we proposed the use of folate - conjugated DNA - loaded cationic MBs (FCMBs). When combined with FUS as a trigger for BBB opening, FCMBs were converted into nanometer - sized vesicles that were transported to the brain parenchyma. The FCMBs can selectively aggregate around tumor cells that overexpressed the folate receptor, thus enhancing gene delivery via folate - stimulated endocytosis. Our results confirmed that FCMBs can carry DNA on the surface of the MB shell and have good targeting ability on C6 glioma cells. In addition, the optimized FUS parameters for FCMBs - enhanced gene delivery were confirmed by cell experiments (center frequency = 1 MHz; acoustic pressure = 700 kPa; pulse repetition frequency = 5 Hz; cycle number = 10000; exposure time = 1 min; FCMBs concentration = 4 × 10(7) MB/mL). In vivo data also indicated that FCMBs show better gene transfection efficiency than MBs without folate conjugation and the traditional approach of directly injecting the gene. This study described our novel development of multifunctional MBs for FUS - triggered gene delivery / therapy.",

To inform future interventions by identifying successful strategies of family carers with relatives with dementia and agitation living at home. Qualitative in-depth individual interviews were performed with 18 family carers. We used thematic analysis to identify emerging themes. Carers described initial surprise and then acceptance that agitation is a dementia symptom and learned to respond flexibly. Their strategies encompassed: prevention of agitation by familiar routine; reduction of agitation by addressing underlying causes and using distraction; prevention of escalation by risk enablement, not arguing; and control of their emotional responses by ensuring their relative's safety then walking away, carving out some time for themselves and using family and services for emotional and practical help. These strategies can be manualised and tested in future randomised controlled trials for clinical effectiveness in reducing agitation in people with dementia living at home.

  "27444636": "Overnight switching from oxcarbazepine to eslicarbazepine acetate: an observational study There are clinical situations where it might be appropriate to switch patients from immediate-release oxcarbazepine (OXC) to eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL). We investigated the effects of transitioning patients overnight from OXC to ESL. A retrospective, single-center study was conducted in which patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy on a stable dose of immediate-release OXC for at least 4 weeks were switched overnight to ESL. Patients were switched because they experienced persistent seizures with OXC but were unable to tolerate increased OXC dosing due to adverse events. Tolerability was assessed using the Adverse Events Profile (AEP), quality of life was assessed using the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory 10 (QOLIE-10), and alertness was assessed as reaction time using a subtest of the Test Battery for Attention Performance version 2.3. Assessments were performed immediately prior to and 5 days after switching from OXC to ESL (days 0 and 5, respectively). The analysis included 21 patients (12 women, 9 men; mean age 36 years). After switching from OXC to ESL, there were significant improvements in mean scores for AEP (P<.001), QOLIE-10 (P=.001), and alertness (P<.05). Adverse Events Profile total scores improved for 21/21 (100.0%) patients, QOLIE-10 total scores improved for 17/21 (81.0%) patients, and alertness scores improved for 16/21 (76.2%) patients. In this short-term, single-center study, an overnight switch from twice-daily OXC to once-daily ESL in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsies resulted in improvements in side effects, quality of life, and alertness.",
  "27931296": "Intravenous and subcutaneous immunoglobulin G replacement therapy Human polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) for therapeutic use has been available for decades. This drug was developed for treatment of antibody deficiency (replacement therapy), although its use has expanded into many anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory applications in recent years. This review focuses on IgG prescribing for replacement therapy. IgG for replacement is most often administered via the intravenous IgG (IVIG) or subcutaneous IgG (SCIG) routes. IVIG is usually administered every 34 weeks, and SCIG is usually administered weekly, although variations may be considered in all cases. Recently, a new product became available that uses hyaluronidase to facilitate absorption of large doses of SCIG less frequently (every 34 weeks, as with IVIG). There are important differences between the pharmacokinetics of these three routes of administration. IVIG therapy leads to high peaks and low troughs between infusions. IgG concentration fluctuates much less over time with SCIG. Hyaluronidase -facilitated SCIG is intermediate. SCIG may have lower bioavailability in comparison with IVIG and may require higher doses over time; this is not true for hyaluronidase SCIG. However, there are large variations in IgG half-life among individuals and with different products. Therefore, individualization of therapy is essential. Mild systemic flu-like adverse effects may affect up to 2025% of patients who receive IVIG, smaller fractions may experience more-severe symptoms, whereas anaphylaxis is exceedingly rare. General flu-like systemic adverse effects are minimal with SCIG (intermediate with hyaluronidase SCIG), but transient (24 hours), mild, local inflammatory symptoms at infusion sites are relatively common with both forms. Additional rare but important complications of IgG therapy include thrombotic events and hemolysis that can be seen at high doses with any route of administration. Renal adverse effects may occur with IVIG as well. The variety of IgG products and routes of administration available today creates many opportunities for physicians to work with patients to find the optimal therapy for all.",

Nonadherence is a particular challenge in older women, even though they stand to benefit the most from AET. Therefore, a novel eHealth tool (OPTIMUM) that integrates real-time analysis of health administrative claims data was developed to provide point-of-care decision support for clinicians. The objectives of the study are to determine the effectiveness of a patient -specific, real-time eHealth alert delivered at point-of-care in reducing rates of AET discontinuation and to understand patient -level factors related to AET discontinuation as well as to assess integration of eHealth alerts regarding deviations from best practices in administration of AET by cancer care teams. A prospective, 2- group controlled comparison pilot study will be conducted at 2 urban, McGill University-affiliated hospitals, the Royal Victoria Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital. A minimum of 43 patients per study arm will be enrolled through site-level allocation. Follow-up is 1.5 years. Health care professionals at the intervention site will have access to the eHealth tool, which will report to them in real-time medical events with known associations to AET discontinuation, an AET adherence monitor, and a discontinuation alert. Cox proportional hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals will estimate risks of AET discontinuation. Tests for significance will be 2-sided with a significance level of P<.05. This protocol has been approved and funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The study will evaluate site-level differences between AET discontinuation and AET adherence and assess care team actions at the intervention site. Participant enrollment into this project is expected to start September 2016 with primary data ready to present by June 2018. This study will offer an opportunity to verify the feasibility of integrating an eHealth tool that aims to improve the long-term management of breast cancer in a high-risk population by allowing more timely intervention to prevent or rapidly address AET discontinuation.",
  "28236014": "The SmartOR: a distributed sensor network to improve operating room efficiency Despite the significant expense of OR time, best practice achieves only 70% efficiency. Compounding this problem is a lack of real-time data. Most current OR utilization programs require manual data entry. Automated systems require installation and maintenance of expensive tracking hardware throughout the institution. This study developed an inexpensive, automated OR utilization system and analyzed data from multiple operating rooms. OR activity was deconstructed into four room states. A sensor network was then developed to automatically capture these states using only three sensors, a local wireless network, and a data capture computer. Two systems were then installed into two ORs, recordings captured 24/7. The SmartOR recorded the following events: any room activity, patient entry/exit time, anesthesia time, laparoscopy time, room turnover time, and time of preoperative patient identification by the surgeon. From November 2014 to December 2015, data on 1003 cases were collected. The mean turnover time was 36 min, and 38% of cases met the institutional goal of ≤30 min. Data analysis also identified outlier cases (>1 SD from mean) in the domains of time from patient entry into the OR to intubation (11% of cases) and time from extubation to patient exiting the OR (11% of cases). Time from surgeon identification of patient to scheduled procedure start time was 11 min (institution bylaws require 20 min before scheduled start time), yet OR teams required 22 min on average to bring a patient into the room after surgeon identification. The SmartOR automatically and reliably captures data on OR room state and, in real time, identifies outlier cases that may be examined closer to improve efficiency. As no manual entry is required, the data are indisputable and allow OR teams to maintain a patient -centric focus.",
  "28107427": "Serine Phosphorylation of SLP76 Is Dispensable for T Cell Development but Modulates Helper T Cell Function The adapter protein SLP76 is a key orchestrator of T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction. We previously identified a negative feedback loop that modulates T cell activation, involving phosphorylation of Ser376 of SLP76 by the hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1). However, the physiological relevance of this regulatory mechanism was still unknown. To address this question, we generated a SLP76-S376A - expressing knock-in mouse strain and investigated the effects of Ser376 mutation on T cell development and function. We report here that SLP76-S376A - expressing mice exhibit normal thymocyte development and no detectable phenotypic alterations in mature T cell subsets or other lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages. Biochemical analyses revealed that mutant T cells were hypersensitive to TCR stimulation. Indeed, phosphorylation of several signaling proteins, including SLP76 itself, phospholipase Cγ1 and the protein kinases AKT and ERK1 / 2, was increased. These modifications correlated with increased Th1-type and decreased Th2-type cytokine production by SLP76-S376A T cells, but did not result in significant changes of proliferative capacity nor activation - induced cell death susceptibility. Hence, our results reveal that SLP76-Ser376 phosphorylation does not mediate all HPK1 -dependent regulatory effects in T cells but it fine-tunes helper T cell responses.",
  "27894158": "Craving behavioral intervention for internet gaming disorder: remediation of functional connectivity of the ventral striatum Psychobehavioral intervention is an effective treatment of Internet addiction, including Internet gaming disorder (IGD). However, the neural mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain unclear. Cortical - ventral striatum (VS) circuitry is a common target of psychobehavioral interventions in drug addiction, and cortical - VS dysfunction has been reported in IGD; hence, the primary aim of the study was to investigate how the VS circuitry responds to psychobehavioral interventions in IGD. In a cross-sectional study, we examined resting-state functional connectivity of the VS in 74 IGD subjects (IGDs) and 41 healthy controls (HCs). In a follow-up craving behavioral intervention (CBI) study, of the 74 IGD subjects, 20 IGD subjects received CBI (CBI+) and 16 IGD subjects did not (CBI-). All participants were scanned twice with similar time interval to assess the effects of CBI. IGD subjects showed greater resting-state functional connectivity of the VS to left inferior parietal lobule (lIPL), right inferior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus, in positive association with the severity of IGD. Moreover, compared with CBI-, CBI+ showed significantly greater decrease in VS - lIPL connectivity, along with amelioration in addiction severity following the intervention. These findings demonstrated that functional connectivity between VS and lIPL, each presumably mediating gaming craving and attentional bias, may be a potential biomarker of the efficacy of psychobehavioral intervention. These results also suggested that non-invasive techniques such as transcranial magnetic or direct current stimulation targeting the VS - lIPL circuitry may be used in the treatment of Internet gaming disorders.",

So, with their ability to affect lipid levels, the LDLR, ApoB and ApoE polymorphisms could be one of the factors influencing development of atherosclerosis. This hypothesis has been tested in different populations with conflicting results. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between the LDLR, ApoB and ApoE genes polymorphisms with premature CAD (PCAD) in Egyptians. One hundred thirty-five patients of PCAD and one hundred thirty-two ages and sex matched control subjects were included in the study. LDLR and ApoB genes polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The ApoE genotypes were identified by multiplex amplification refractory mutation system (multi-AMRS). We found that LDLR A(+)A(+) genotype, ApoB X(+) allele and ApoE E4 allele increased the risk of PCAD by 1.8, 2.1 and 12.1 respectively. The present study proved that smoking, metabolic syndrome, ApoB X(+)X(+) genotype and ApoE E4 allele were independent risk factors for the development of PCAD. This is the first study investigate the association between low density lipoprotein receptor, apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein E genes polymorphisms with PCAD and lipid levels in Egyptians and we concluded that the LDLR A(+)A(+) genotype, ApoB X(+) allele and ApoE E4 allele may be associated with an increased risk for development of PCAD by elevated levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein (LDLc). The coexistence of CAD risk factors with LDLR A(+)A(+) genotype, ApoB X(+) allele and ApoE E4 allele may increase the risk of the development of PCAD in Egyptian patients.",
  "28497418": "Assessing time-of-flight signal-to-noise ratio gains within the myocardium and subsequent reductions in administered activity in cardiac PET studies Time-of-flight (TOF) is known to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and facilitate reductions in administered activity. Established measures of SNR gain are derived from areas of uniform uptake, which is not applicable to the heterogeneous uptake in cardiac PET images using fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG). This study aimed to develop a technique to quantify SNR gains within the myocardium due to TOF. Reference TOF SNR gains were measured in 88 FDG oncology patients. Phantom data were used to translate reference SNR gains and validate a method of quantifying SNR gains within the myocardium from parametric images produced from multiple replicate images. This technique was applied to 13 FDG cardiac viability patients. Reference TOF SNR gains of +23% ± 8.5% were measured in oncology patients. Measurements of SNR gain from the phantom data were in agreement and showed the parametric image technique to be sufficiently robust. SNR gains within the myocardium in the viability patients were +21% ± 2.8%. A method to quantify SNR gains from TOF within the myocardium has been developed and evaluated. SNR gains within the myocardium are comparable to those observed by established methods. This allows guidance for protocol optimization for TOF systems in cardiac PET.",
  "28324211": "GEORG-SCHMORL-PRIZE OF THE GERMAN SPINE SOCIETY (DWG) 2016: Comparison of in vitro osteogenic potential of iliac crest and degenerative facet joint bone autografts for intervertebral fusion in lumbar spinal stenosis The promotion of spinal fusion using bone autografts is largely mediated by the osteoinductive potential of progenitors / mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that reside in the marrow spaces of cancellous bone. Iliac crest is the common autograft donor site, but its use presents an increased risk for donor site pain, morbidity and infection. Degenerative bone samples harvested during facetectomy might provide an alternative viable source of osteoinductive autografts. In this study, we conducted an intra-individual comparison of the osteogenic potential of isolated low passage MSC from both sources. Iliac crest and degenerative facet joints were harvested from eight consecutive patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interspinal fusion due to lumbar spinal stenosis. MSC were isolated by collagenase digestion, selected by plastic adherence and minimally expanded for downstream assays. Clonogenic and osteogenic potential was evaluated by colony formation assays in control and osteogenic culture medium. Osteogenic properties, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) induction, matrix mineralization and type I collagen mRNA and protein expression were characterized using quantitative histochemical staining and reverse transcription PCR. Spontaneous adipogenesis was analysed by adipocyte enumeration and gene expression analysis of adipogenic markers. Average colony-forming efficiency in osteogenic medium was equal between iliac crest (38 ± 12%) and facet joint (36 ± 11%). Osteogenic potential at the clonal level was 55 ± 26 and 68 ± 17% for iliac crest and facet joint MSC, respectively. Clonogenic and osteogenic potential were significantly negatively associated with donor age. Osteogenic differentiation led to significant induction of ALP activity in iliac crest (sixfold) and facet joint (eightfold) MSC. Matrix mineralization quantified by Alizarin red staining was increased by osteogenic differentiation, yet similar between both MSC sources. Protein expression of type I collagen was enhanced during osteogenesis and significantly greater in iliac crest MSC. Correspondingly, COL1A2 mRNA expression was higher in osteogenically differentiated MSC from iliac crest. Adipocyte numbers showed significant differences between iliac crest (63 ± 60) and facet joint (18 ± 15) MSC under osteogenic conditions. Negative (GREM1) and positive (FABP4) adipogenic markers were not differentially expressed between sources. MSC from iliac crest and degenerative facet joints largely display similar clonogenic and osteogenic properties in vitro. Differences at the molecular level are not likely to impair the osteoinductive capacity of facet joint MSC. Bone autografts from facetectomy would be viable alternatives as bone autografts for intervertebral spinal fusion in lumbar spinal stenosis.",

Results from a UK clinical sample Discrepancies are often found between child and parent reports of child psychopathology, nevertheless the role of the child's presenting difficulties in relation to these is underexplored. This study investigates whether parent-child agreement on the conduct and emotional scales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) varied as a result of certain child characteristics, including the child's presenting problems to clinical services, age and gender. The UK -based sample consisted of 16,754 clinical records of children aged 11-17, the majority of which were female (57%) and White (76%). The dataset was provided by the Child Outcomes Research Consortium, which collects outcome measures from child services across the UK. Clinicians reported the child's presenting difficulties, and parents and children completed the SDQ. Using correlation analysis, the main findings indicated that agreement varied as a result of the child's difficulties for reports of conduct problems, and this seemed to be related to the presence or absence of externalising difficulties in the child's presentation. This was not the case for reports of emotional difficulties. In addition, agreement was higher when reporting problems not consistent with the child's presentation; for instance, agreement on conduct problems was greater for children presenting with internalising problems. Lastly, the children's age and gender did not seem to have an impact on agreement. These findings demonstrate that certain child presenting difficulties, and in particular conduct problems, may be related to informant agreement and need to be considered in clinical practice and research.

Sosk. is a plant species belonging to family Polygonaceae. Susceptibility to threaten, presence of various chemical constituents, and many medicinal effects reported for this plant in addition to rareness of in vitro culture studies have fuelled the need for its micropropagation and phytochemical investigations of the produced cultures. To employ in vitro culture technique for ex situ conservation of C. polygonoides, using the fruit as an explant; establish callus and cell suspension cultures from in vitro germinated plantlets; investigate the production of phenolics through callus, redifferentiated shoot, and cell suspension cultures; attempt to enhance cell capacity to accumulate phenolics using salicylic acid and yeast extract and provide a brief demonstration of biosynthetic pathway leading to phenolic production. Modified Murashige and Skoog media supplemented with growth hormones such as kinetin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, 6-benzylaminopurine, and indole-3-acetic acid were used to establish callus, redifferentiated shoots, and cell suspension cultures. Elicitation of cell suspension culture was performed using salicylic acid and yeast extracts. A reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography method for determination of phenolic content in the aforementioned cultures was developed. The unorganized callus and cell suspension cultures contained fewer amounts of phenolic compounds than redifferentiated shoots. Elicitation produced massive quantitative reprogramming of phenolic content. The present study offers an alternative and renewable source for this valuable natural plant, provide a chance to improve secondary metabolite yield and serve as a useful tool for studying the biosynthesis of these compounds and its regulation in plant cells. In vitro culture techniques provided a strategy for ex situ conservation of the endangered C. polygonoides .Unorganized callus and cell suspension cultures accumulated less phenolic content than re-differentiated shoots.

Recent advances in endovascular technologies have expanded the use of coil embolization for small aneurysm treatment. However, limited reports describe their safety and efficacy profiles in very small anterior communicating artery aneurysms. We sought to review and report the immediate and long-term clinical as well as radiographic outcomes of consecutive patients with ruptured very small anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with current endovascular coil embolization techniques. A prospectively maintained single-institution neuroendovascular database was accessed to identify consecutive cases of very small (<3 mm) ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated endovascularly between 2006 and 2013. A total of 20 patients with ruptured very small (<3 mm) anterior communicating artery aneurysms were consecutively treated with coil embolization. The average maximum diameter was 2.66 ± 0.41 mm. Complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved for 17 (85%) aneurysms and near-complete aneurysm occlusion for 3 (15%) aneurysms. Intraoperative perforation was seen in 2 (10%) patients without any clinical worsening or need for an external ventricular drain. A thromboembolic event occurred in 1 (5 %) patient without clinical worsening or radiologic infarct. Median clinical follow-up was 12 (±14.1) months and median imaging follow-up was 12 (±18.4) months.

  "27538372": "Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 regulates the early differentiation of cardiomyocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells Mitochondria are crucial for maintaining the properties of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and for regulating their subsequent differentiation into diverse cell lineages, including cardiomyocytes. However, mitochondrial regulators that manage the rate of differentiation or cell fate have been rarely identified. This study aimed to determine the potential mitochondrial factor that controls the differentiation of ESCs into cardiac myocytes. We induced cardiomyocyte differentiation from mouse ESCs (mESCs) and performed microarray assays to assess messenger RNA (mRNA) expression changes at differentiation day 8 (D8) compared with undifferentiated mESCs (D0). Among the differentially expressed genes, Pdp1 expression was significantly decreased (27-fold) on D8 compared to D0, which was accompanied by suppressed mitochondrial indices, including ATP levels, membrane potential, ROS and mitochondrial Ca(2+). Notably, Pdp1 overexpression significantly enhanced the mitochondrial indices and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and reduced the expression of cardiac differentiation marker mRNA and the cardiac differentiation rate compared to a mock control. In confirmation of this, a knockdown of the Pdp1 gene promoted the expression of cardiac differentiation marker mRNA and the cardiac differentiation rate. In conclusion, our results suggest that mitochondrial PDP1 is a potential regulator that controls cardiac differentiation at an early differentiation stage in ESCs.",

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) persists in most humans, requires T cell immunity to control, yet tissue immune responses remain undefined. Here, we investigated human CMV -specific T cells, virus persistence and CMV -associated T cell homeostasis in blood, lymphoid, mucosa l and secretory tissues of 44 CMV seropositive and 28 seronegative donors. CMV -specific T cells were maintained in distinct distribution patterns, highest in blood, bone marrow (BM), or lymph nodes (LN), with the frequency and function in blood distinct from tissues. CMV genomes were detected predominantly in lung and also in spleen, BM, blood and LN. High frequencies of activated CMV -specific T cells were found in blood and BM samples with low virus detection, whereas in lung, CMV -specific T cells were present along with detectable virus. In LNs, CMV -specific T cells exhibited quiescent phenotypes independent of virus. Overall, T cell differentiation was enhanced in sites of viral persistence with age. Together, our results suggest tissue T cell reservoirs for CMV control shaped by both viral and tissue - intrinsic factors, with global effects on homeostasis of tissue T cells over the lifespan.",
  "27790175": "Predictors and Moderators of Spontaneous Pretend Play in Children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder Although pretend play has long been linked to children's normative cognitive development, inconsistent findings call for greater rigor in examining this relation (Lillard et al., 2013). Spontaneous pretend play is often impacted in atypical development, notably in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since ASD traits exist along a continuum in the general population, investigating how pretend play varies across the range of ASD symptoms by indexing variations in ASD traits in both typically developing and ASD populations may provide insight into how ASD symptoms may influence the relation between pretend play and associated processes in cognitive development. This study used rigorous observational methods to assess spontaneous pretend play. Specifically, 5- min free-play sessions with two discrete toy sets were double-coded by blinded coders (coder assignment counterbalanced). Key facets of pretense development [attribution of pretend properties (APP), object substitution (OS), imaginary objects] were examined. These facets of pretend play production were then analyzed in relation to ASD symptoms, as well as plausible, long-theorized correlates [theory of mind (ToM), verbal ability, familiarity, and interest in specific toys]. Forty children (Mage = 6;5, SDage = 1.45; 29 males), six of whom met the threshold for ASD diagnosis via parent -reported ASD symptoms, participated in play sessions and completed measures of verbal IQ and ToM. Besides the measure of child ASD symptoms, parents completed a survey of their child's interest in and familiarity with the play session toys. Overall, greater ToM predicted more APP, and more interest in the toys presented predicted more OS. In terms of overall pretend play production, two results were counterintuitive. First, among children with more ASD symptoms, verbal ability marginally negatively predicted pretend play production. Second, among children with fewer ASD symptoms, ToM negatively predicted pretend play production. Further probing revealed that the negative effect of ASD symptoms on pretend play was simultaneously moderated by both variables: low ToM and high verbal ability both related to less pretend play production among children with more ASD symptoms. Implications for assessment and subsequent treatment for pretend ability among children with varying degrees of ASD symptoms, as well as for future research, are discussed.",

Co-folding with FliFC induces substantial conformational changes in FliGN and suggests that FliF and FliG have the same stoichiometry within the rotor. Modeling the FliFC: FliGN complex into cryo-electron microscopy rotor density updates the architecture of the middle and upper switch complex and shows how domain shuffling of a conserved interaction module anchors the cytoplasmic rotor to the membrane.",

Rats with developing type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were treated once daily by oral gavage on study days -14 to 17 with vehicle or NEM (52 mg/kg body weight). Rats were euthanized on study day 17. Efficacy was assessed by daily ankle caliper measurements, ankle diameter expressed as area under the curve (AUCd0-17), and histopathologic evaluation of ankles and knees. Serum biomarkers of cartilage function and inflammation [collagen type II C-telopeptide (CTXII), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M)] were measured by ELISA. Treatment with NEM resulted in significant beneficial effects on the daily ankle diameter measurements and ankle diameter AUC. Ankle and knee histopathology scores were significantly reduced (36% and 43% reduction of summed individual histopathology scores for ankle and knee, respectively; p < 0.05) toward normal for rats given NEM compared to vehicle controls. The percent reduction of serum CTXII, COMP, and A2M in NEM - treated rats ranged from 30% to 72% (p < 0.05). NEM significantly improved multiple aspects of inflammatory arthritis including inflammation, pannus, cartilage damage, bone resorption, and periosteal bone formation. This study provides further support for the use of CTXII, COMP, and A2M as relevant biomarkers that were responsive to NEM.",
  "28088177": "A novel quantitative PCR detects Babesia infection in patients not identified by currently available non-nucleic acid amplification tests Ticks transmit Babesia microti, the causative agents of babesiosis in North America and Europe. Babesiosis is now endemic in Northeastern USA and affects people of all ages. Babesia species infect erythrocytes and can be transmitted through blood transfusion. Whole blood and blood products, which are not tested for Babesia, can cause transfusion - transmitted babesiosis (TTB) resulting in severe consequences in the immuno-compromised patients. The purpose of this study was epidemiological evaluation of babesiosis in a tick-infested state. We examined blood samples from 192 patients who visited clinics during the active tick-borne diseases season, using a newly developed qPCR assay that uses the specific molecular beacon probe. Due to the absence of clear symptomology, clinical laboratories did not test 131 samples by IFA, FISH or microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears. Babesia infection was detected in all age groups by FISH and microscopy; notably patients >40 years of age represented 64% of tested samples and 13% were younger patients. We tested all samples using qPCR and found that 38% were positive for Babesia. Of 28 samples that were positive by FISH, 27 (96%) were also positive by qPCR indicating high congruency between nucleic acid based tests. Interestingly, of 78 asymptomatic samples not tested by FISH, 22 were positive by our qPCR. Direct detection of Babesia relies upon microscopic examination of patient blood smears, which is labor intensive, difficult to scale up, requires specific expertise and is hence, often not performed. In fact, a clinical laboratory examined only 23 of 86 blood samples obtained from two different counties by microscopy. By considering individuals positive for Babesia infection when results from currently available microscopy, FISH or serological tests were positive, we found that our qPCR is highly sensitive (96.2%) and showed a specificity of 70.5% for Babesia. Robust qPCR using specific probes can be highly useful for efficient and appropriate diagnosis of babesiosis in patients in conjunction with conventional diagnostics, or as a stand-alone test, especially for donated blood screening. The use of a nucleic acid amplification test based screening of blood and blood products could prevent TTB.",
  "27876598": "Antithrombotic activity of Batroxase, a metalloprotease from Bothrops atrox venom, in a model of venous thrombosis Snake venoms are great sources of bioactive molecules, which may be used as models for new drugs. Toxins that interfere in hemostasis have received considerable attention over the years. This study aimed at the evaluation of the antithrombotic activity of Batroxase, a P-I metalloprotease from Bothrops atrox venom, in an animal model of venous thrombosis. The antithrombotic activity of Batroxase was tested in vivo in a model based on two factors of the Virchow's Triad: blood flow alterations (partial stenosis of the inferior vena cava), and vessel wall injury (10% ferric chloride for 5min), in comparison with sodium heparin (positive control) and saline (negative control). Bleeding / clotting time was assessed by a tail bleeding assay. The immunogenicity of Batroxase was also analyzed. Batroxase (12mg/kg) reduced thrombus formation in 81%, similarly to heparin (100U/kg), which reduced it in 85% in comparison with the saline group. Both Batroxase and heparin increased bleeding / clotting time in approximately 3 fold. Immunizations of rabbits with Batroxase do not result in detectable levels of antibodies against this metalloprotease. Batroxase presents antithrombotic activity in vivo. Moreover, its lack of immunogenicity increases the interest on its possible therapeutic potential over thrombogenic disorders.",

Studies of lonely individuals reported differential expression of inflammatory genes in peripheral leukocytes and diminished activation in brain reward regions such as nucleus accumbens, but could not address gene expression in the human brain. Here, we examined genome-wide RNA expression in post-mortem nucleus accumbens from donors (N=26) with known loneliness measures. Loneliness was associated with 1710 differentially expressed transcripts and genes from 1599 genes (DEGs; false discovery rate P<0.05, fold change ⩾|2|, controlling for confounds) previously associated with behavioral processes, neurological disease, psychological disorders, cancer, organismal injury and skeletal and muscular disorders, as well as networks of upstream RNA regulators. Furthermore, a number of DEGs were associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes (that was correlated with loneliness in this sample, although gene expression analyses controlled for AD diagnosis). These results identify novel targets for future mechanistic studies of gene networks in nucleus accumbens and gene regulatory mechanisms across a variety of diseases exacerbated by loneliness.

  "27284493": "Sensitization to the motor stimulant effects of 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and cross-sensitization to methamphetamine in rats In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in abuse of the synthetic cathinone 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), often in combination with other illicit stimulants. We sought to determine if repeated exposure to MDPV would produce sensitization to the motor stimulant effects of the drug, and whether cross-sensitization would develop with the stimulant effects of methamphetamine (METH). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered MDPV (1 or 5 mg/kg) or saline once daily for 5 days at 24 hour intervals, or were administered MDPV (1 mg/kg) or saline once daily for 5 days at 48 hour intervals. For cross-sensitization experiments, rats were administered METH (1 mg/kg) or MDPV (1 or 5 mg/kg) once daily for 5 days at 48 hour intervals, and following a 5 day incubation period, were given an acute challenge injection of either MDPV (0.5 mg/kg) or METH (0.5 mg/kg), respectively. Rats repeatedly administered MDPV (1 mg/kg) every 48 hours, but not every 24 hours, demonstrated increased motor activity when given either a subsequent challenge of MDPV (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or METH (0.5 mg/kg), indicating the development of behavioral sensitization and cross-sensitization, respectively. Moreover, rats repeatedly administered METH (1 mg/kg) every 48 hours did not exhibit cross-sensitization to the motor stimulating effects of a subsequent challenge with MDPV (0.5 mg/kg). These results suggest that specific patterns of MDPV administration may lead to lasting changes in behavioral responses to subsequent METH exposure.",

  "27836684": "Ketogenic diets improve behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder in a sex - specific manner in the EL mouse The core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are poorly treated with current medications. Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are frequently comorbid with a diagnosis of epilepsy and vice versa. Medically - supervised ketogenic diets are remarkably effective nonpharmacological treatments for epilepsy, even in drug -refractory cases. There is accumulating evidence that supports the efficacy of ketogenic diets in treating the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders in animal models as well as limited reports of benefits in patients. This study tests the behavioral effects of ketogenic diet feeding in the EL mouse, a model with behavioral characteristics of autism spectrum disorder and comorbid epilepsy. Male and female EL mice were fed control diet or one of two ketogenic diet formulas ad libitum starting at 5weeks of age. Beginning at 8weeks of age, diet protocols continued and performance of each group on tests of sociability and repetitive behavior was assessed. A ketogenic diet improved behavioral characteristics of autism spectrum disorder in a sex - and test - specific manner; ketogenic diet never worsened relevant behaviors. Ketogenic diet feeding improved multiple measures of sociability and reduced repetitive behavior in female mice, with limited effects in males. Additional experiments in female mice showed that a less strict, more clinically - relevant diet formula was equally effective in improving sociability and reducing repetitive behavior. Taken together these results add to the growing number of studies suggesting that ketogenic and related diets may provide significant relief from the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, and suggest that in some cases there may be increased efficacy in females.",
  "28054379": "To wait or not to wait? Improving results when interviewing intoxicated witnesses to violence Witnesses to violent crimes are often alcohol intoxicated, but few studies have investigated the impact of alcohol on witness reports. This study investigated how alcohol intoxication and time of interview affected reports of intimate partner violence (IPV). One hundred thirty six healthy men (N = 66) and women (N = 70) were randomized to an alcohol group (0.8g/kg for men, 0.75g/kg for women) (N = 70) or control group (N = 66), given juice. Participants consumed drinks in a laboratory setting before they witnessed an IPV scenario. Fifty percent of the intoxicated and sober participants were interviewed ten minutes after viewing the film and all participants were interviewed one week later. For the analyses, participants in the alcohol group were divided into two groups (moderately / highly intoxicated) based on their BAC-level. Ten minutes after viewing the event, highly (BAC = 0.08-0.15) intoxicated witnesses gave shorter, but as accurate, reports as moderately intoxicated / sober witnesses. All witnesses gave shorter and less accurate reports one week later compared to immediately after. However, an immediate interview increased completeness one week later. In general, time and high intoxication made witnesses give less detailed accounts of actions and verbal information, but not of objects. Highly intoxicated witnesses reported less actions and verbal information in all interviews, while information regarding objects was reported to a similar extent. At the present BAC-level, it is beneficial to conduct an immediate free recall interview with intoxicated witnesses to obtain a maximum amount of correct information and minimize the negative effect of time.",
  "27871906": "Adenosine, but not guanosine, protects vaginal epithelial cells from Trichomonas vaginalis cytotoxicity Trichomonas vaginalis causes the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease worldwide. The cytoadherence and cytotoxicity upon the vaginal epithelial cells are crucial for the infection. Extracellular nucleotides are released during cell damage and, along with their nucleosides, can activate purinoceptors. The opposing effects of nucleotides versus nucleosides are regulated by ectonucleotidases. Herein we evaluated the hemolysis and cytolysis induced by T. vaginalis, as well as the extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis along with the effects mediated by nucleotides and nucleosides on cytotoxicity. In addition, the gene expression of purinoceptors in host cells was determined. The hemolysis and cytolysis exerted by all T. vaginalis isolates presented positive Pearson correlation. All T. vaginalis isolates were able to hydrolyze nucleotides, showing higher NTPDase than ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. The most cytotoxic isolate, TV-LACM6, hydrolyzes ATP, GTP with more efficiency than AMP and GMP. The vaginal epithelial cell line (HMVII) expressed the genes for all subtypes of P1, P2X and P2Y receptors. Finally, when nucleotides and nucleosides were tested, the cytotoxic effect elicited by TV-LACM6 was increased with nucleotides. In contrast, the cytotoxicity was reversed by adenosine in presence of EHNA, but not by guanosine, contributing to the understanding of the purinergic signaling role on T. vaginalis cytotoxicity.",
  "27410251": "Mother - Infant Emotion Regulation at Three Months: The Role of Maternal Anxiety, Depression and Parenting Stress While the association between anxiety and postpartum depression is well known, few studies have investigated the relationship between these two states and parenting stress. Furthermore, a number of studies have found that postpartum depression affects mother - infant emotion regulation, but there has been only one study on anxiety and emotion regulation and no studies at all on parenting stress and emotion regulation. Therefore, the primary aim of our study is to identify, in a community sample of 71 mothers, the relationship between maternal depression, anxiety, and parenting stress. The second aim is to examine the relationship between anxiety, postpartum depression, and parenting stress and mother - infant emotion regulation assessed at 3 months. Mother - infant interaction was coded with a modified version of the Infant Caregiver and Engagement Phases (ICEP) using a microanalytic approach. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) were administered to the mothers to assess depression, anxiety, and parenting stress, respectively. Analysis revealed correlations between anxiety and depression, showing that parenting stress is associated with both states. In a laboratory observation, depression was correlated with both negative maternal states and negative dyadic matches as well as infant positive / mother negative mismatches; anxiety was correlated with both negative maternal states and infant negative states as well as mismatches involving one of the partners having a negative state. Multiple regression analysis showed that anxiety is a greater predictor than depression of less adequate styles of mother - infant emotion regulation. Parenting stress was not shown to predict such regulation.",
  "28005193": "TREK-1 (K2P2.1) K(+) channels are suppressed in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure and provide therapeutic targets for rhythm control Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Concomitant heart failure (HF) poses a particular therapeutic challenge and is associated with prolonged atrial electrical refractoriness compared with non-failing hearts. We hypothesized that downregulation of atrial repolarizing TREK-1 (K2P2.1) K(+) channels contributes to electrical remodeling during AF with HF, and that TREK-1 gene transfer would provide rhythm control via normalization of atrial effective refractory periods in this AF subset. In patients with chronic AF and HF, atrial TREK-1 mRNA levels were reduced by 82% (left atrium) and 81% (right atrium) compared with sinus rhythm (SR) subjects. Human findings were recapitulated in a porcine model of atrial tachypacing-induced AF and reduced left ventricular function. TREK-1 mRNA (-66%) and protein (-61%) was suppressed in AF animals at 14-day follow-up compared with SR controls. Downregulation of repolarizing TREK-1 channels was associated with prolongation of atrial effective refractory periods versus baseline conditions, consistent with prior observations in humans with HF. In a preclinical therapeutic approach, pigs were randomized to either atrial Ad-TREK-1 gene therapy or sham treatment. Gene transfer effectively increased TREK-1 protein levels and attenuated atrial effective refractory period prolongation in the porcine AF model. Ad-TREK-1 increased the SR prevalence to 62% during follow-up in AF animals, compared to 35% in the untreated AF group. In conclusion, TREK-1 downregulation and rhythm control by Ad-TREK-1 transfer suggest mechanistic and potential therapeutic significance of TREK-1 channels in a subgroup of AF patients with HF and prolonged atrial effective refractory periods. Functional correction of ionic remodeling through TREK-1 gene therapy represents a novel paradigm to optimize and specify AF management.",
  "27310660": "The Origin of Selectivity in the Complexation of N-Methyl Amino Acids by Tetraphosphonate Cavitands We report on the eligibility of tetraphosphonate resorcinarene cavitands for the molecular recognition of amino acids. We determined the crystal structure of 13 complexes of the tetraphosphonate cavitand Tiiii[H, CH3, CH3] with amino acids. (1) H NMR and (31) P NMR experiments and ITC analysis were performed to probe the binding between cavitand Tiiii[C3H7, CH3, C2H5] or the water - soluble counterpart Tiiii[C3H6Py(+)Cl(-), CH3, C2H5] and a selection of representative amino acids. The reported studies and results allowed us (i) to highlight the noncovalent interactions involved in the binding event in each case; (ii) to investigate the ability of tetraphosphonate cavitand receptors to discriminate between the different amino acids; (iii) to calculate the Ka values of the different complexes formed and evaluate the thermodynamic parameters of the complexation process, dissecting the entropic and enthalpic contributions; and (iv) to determine the solvent influence on the complexation selectivity. By moving from methanol to water, the complexation changed from entropy driven to entropy opposed, leading to a drop of almost three orders in the magnitude of the Ka. However, this reduction in binding affinity is associated with a dramatic increase in selectivity, since in aqueous solutions only N-methylated amino acids are effectively recognized. The thermodynamic profile of the binding does not change in PBS solution. The pivotal role played by cation-π interactions is demonstrated by the linear correlation found between the log Ka in methanol solution and the depth of (+)N-CH3 cavity inclusion in the molecular structures. These findings are relevant for the potential use of phosphonate cavitands as synthetic receptors for the detection of epigenetic modifications of histones in physiological media.",
  "27642003": "Oral and oropharyngeal cancer and the role of sexual behaviour: a systematic review This systematic review identified and evaluated the evidence for the role of sexual behaviours in the development of oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs) and oral cavity cancers (OCCs). Following the PRISMA guidelines, we identified observational and interventional studies reporting associations between several different sexual behaviours and OPC or OCC. Study quality was assessed independently by two reviewers using a validated scoring system. From 513 papers identified, 21, reporting on 20 studies, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two cohort studies were rated as moderate quality. The 18 case-control studies were rated as weak; nine comparing people with OPC or OCC to people without cancer, eight comparing HPV-positive to HPV-negative cancer patients and one comparing OPCs to other head and neck cancers. One study was a pooled analysis of seven of the included studies with some additional information. Twelve sexual behaviours were assessed and 69 associations reported. The studies differed in the comparisons made, the sexual behaviours assessed, and how these were reported and categorized, so no quantitative meta-analyses were appropriate. Most studies combined OPC and OCC. Several significantly increased risks were seen with a high number of lifetime sexual partners (nine studies) and with the practice of oral sex (five studies), although two studies found a significant negative association with OCC and ever performing oral sex. Two cohort studies of men and women in homosexual relationships found increases in oral cancer risk, and a cohort study of men married to women who had a history of cervical cancer also showed an increased risk of oral cancers. Results for other sexual behaviours were limited and inconsistent, and these included the following: younger age at first sexual intercourse, number of lifetime oral sex partners, the practice of oral - anal sex, the number of oral - anal sex partners, and ever performing anal sex. Only one study assessed casual sex, never or rare use of a condom and having a sexual partner with a history of genital warts, finding significant associations in the two former behaviours. The current evidence for sexual behaviours being risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal cancer is limited and inconsistent. Evidence suggests that the number of sexual partners and performing oral sex are associated with a greater risk. Furthermore men whose partners have had cervical cancer may have an increased risk. More studies looking at OPC specifically will be useful to determine whether these behaviours are subsite - selective.",
  "28072649": "Is Early Definitive Fixation of Bicondylar Tibial Plateau Fractures Safe? An Observational Cohort Study The optimal treatment protocol for bicondylar plateau fractures remains controversial. Contrary to popular practice which favors a staged protocol in many high-energy fracture patterns, we have used early single-stage open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) to treat these injuries whenever possible. The purpose of this study was to determine the complication rate and the functional and radiographic outcomes of this strategy. Retrospective cohort study and prospective data collection. Level I trauma center. One hundred one patients with 102 OTA/AO type 41-C bicondylar tibial plateau fractures were treated with early definitive ORIF, defined as nonstaged surgery performed within 72 hours from injury. A subset of patients was part of a longitudinal study and reported functional outcomes at 1 year. Early definitive ORIF. Primary outcome: reoperation rate, defined as any surgery within 12 months after the index operation; secondary outcomes: quality and stability of radiographic fracture reduction; and functional outcome [Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and short musculoskeletal functional assessment (SMFA)]. Nonstaged operative treatment of bicondylar plateau fractures was performed in 91.3% of the fractures during the study period. For those, early definitive ORIF (surgery within 72 hours from injury) was performed in 82.3% fractures. Mean time from injury to ORIF, for closed fractures, was 29.8 hours. Sixteen (15.7%) fractures, which were treated with early definitive ORIF, required an additional surgical procedure within 12 months. Complications included wound infection requiring surgical management, compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomies, nonunion, early fixation failure, and implant removal for discomfort. The reoperation rate was 12.7% if implant removal was excluded. At least 3 of the 4 radiographic criteria used to assess the adequacy of reduction were achieved in 95.1% of cases, and all 4 criteria were met in 59.8% of fractures. The Physical Component of the SF-36 at 12 months was 42.6, which is comparable to values reported in previous studies for operative treatment of bicondylar plateau fractures. In a model where surgery is performed without delay by experienced orthopaedic trauma surgeons, a large proportion of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures can be safely treated with early definitive ORIF. Early surgery was associated with satisfactory postoperative radiographic reductions. Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",
  "27292641": "Joint Development Involves a Continuous Influx of Gdf5 - Positive Cells Synovial joints comprise several tissue types, including articular cartilage, the capsule, and ligaments. All of these compartments are commonly assumed to originate from an early set of Gdf5 - expressing progenitors populating the interzone domain. Here, we provide evidence that joints develop through a continuous influx of cells into the interzone, where they contribute differentially to forming joint tissues. Using a knockin Gdf5 - CreER(T2) mouse, we show that early labeling of Gdf5 - positive interzone cells failed to mark the entire organ. Conversely, multiple Cre activation steps indicated a contribution of these cells to various joint compartments later in development. Spatiotemporal differences between Gdf5 and tdTomato reporter expression support the notion of a continuous recruitment process. Finally, differential contribution of Gdf5 - positive cells to various tissues suggests that the spatiotemporal dynamics of Gdf5 expression may instruct lineage divergence. This work supports the influx model of joint development, which may apply to other organogenic processes.",
  "27680876": "A Variant in the BACH2 Gene Is Associated With Susceptibility to Autoimmune Addison's Disease in Humans Autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) is a rare but highly heritable condition. The BACH2 protein plays a crucial role in T lymphocyte maturation, and allelic variation in its gene has been associated with a number of autoimmune conditions. We aimed to determine whether alleles of the rs3757247 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the BACH2 gene are associated with AAD. This case-control association study was performed in two phases using Taqman chemistry. In the first phase, the rs3757247 SNP was genotyped in 358 UK AAD subjects and 166 local control subjects. Genotype data were also available from 5154 healthy UK controls from the Wellcome Trust (WTCCC2) for comparison. In the second phase, the SNP was genotyped in a validation cohort comprising 317 Norwegian AAD subjects and 365 controls. The frequency of the minor T allele was significantly higher in subjects with AAD from the United Kingdom compared to both the local and WTCCC2 control cohorts (58% vs 45 and 48%, respectively) (local controls, P = 1.1 × 10(-4); odds ratio [OR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-2.18; WTCCC2 controls, P = 1.4 × 10(-6); OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23-1.69). This finding was replicated in the Norwegian validation cohort (P = .0015; OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.14-1.75). Subgroup analysis showed that this association is present in subjects with both isolated AAD (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22-1.92) and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12-1.69) in the UK cohort, and with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 in the Norwegian cohort (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.22-2.06). We have demonstrated, for the first time, that allelic variability at the BACH2 locus is associated with susceptibility to AAD. Given its association with multiple autoimmune conditions, BACH2 can be considered a \"universal\" autoimmune susceptibility locus.",

Intersphincteric resection (ISR) is an alternative to abdominoperineal resection (APR) for a selected subset of patients with low rectal cancer, combining equivalent oncological outcome and sphincter preservation. However, functional results are heterogeneous and often imperfect. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the long-term functional results and quality of life after ISR. One hundred forty-three consecutive patients who underwent surgery for low rectal cancer were analysed. Sixty patients received ISR and 83 patients APR, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimate was used to analyse patients ' survival. The EORTC QLQ-C30, - C29 and the Wexner score were used to determine functional outcome and quality of life. ISR and APR were both associated with comparable morbidity and no mortality. Patients ' disease - and recurrence-free survival after ISR and APR were similar (p = 0.2872 and p = 0.4635). Closure of ileostomy was performed in 73% of all patients after ISR. Long-term outcome showed a rate of incontinence (Wexner score ≥10) in 66% of the patients. Despite this, patients ' quality of life was significantly better after ISR compared to APR in terms of abdominal complaints and psycho-emotional functioning. ISR is technically feasible with acceptable postoperative morbidity rates. Functional results following ISR are compromised by incontinence as the most important complication. However, long-term quality of life is superior to APR, which should be considered when selecting patients for ISR.",
  "27613895": "Examination of the Involvement of Cholinergic - Associated Genes in Nicotine Behaviors in European and African Americans Cigarette smoking is a physiologically harmful habit. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are bound by nicotine and upregulated in response to chronic exposure to nicotine. It is known that upregulation of these receptors is not due to a change in mRNA of these genes, however, more precise details on the process are still uncertain, with several plausible hypotheses describing how nAChRs are upregulated. We have manually curated a set of genes believed to play a role in nicotine - induced nAChR upregulation. Here, we test the hypothesis that these genes are associated with and contribute risk for nicotine dependence (ND) and the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD). Studies with genotypic data on European and African Americans (EAs and AAs, respectively) were collected and a gene-based test was run to test for an association between each gene and ND and CPD. Although several novel genes were associated with CPD and ND at P < 0.05 in EAs and AAs, these associations did not survive correction for multiple testing. Previous associations between CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CHRNB4 and CPD in EAs were replicated. Our hypothesis-driven approach avoided many of the limitations inherent in pathway analyses and provided nominal evidence for association between cholinergic-related genes and nicotine behaviors. We evaluated the evidence for association between a manually curated set of genes and nicotine behaviors in European and African Americans. Although no genes were associated after multiple testing correction, this study has several strengths: by manually curating a set of genes we circumvented the limitations inherent in many pathway analyses and tested several genes that had not yet been examined in a human genetic study; gene-based tests are a useful way to test for association with a set of genes; and these genes were collected based on literature review and conversations with experts, highlighting the importance of scientific collaboration.",
  "27346839": "Long-term antibiofilm activity of carboxymethyl chitosan on mixed biofilm on silicone Silicone voice prostheses are most frequently used in voice rehabilitation of laryngectomized patients. However, the functional device lifetimes are limited due to formation of mixed biofilms. Existing in vitro models simulating biofilm formation are restricted to only short-term periods. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of carboxymethyl chitosan on mixed biofilm formation of fungi and bacteria on silicone over a long-term period. Mixed species biofilms of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Streptococcus salivarius, Rothia dentocariosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were cultivated on the surfaces of medical-grade silicone with and without addition of carboxymethyl chitosan. Biofilm kinetics was monitored using specially designed image analysis software to calculate the percentual surface covering of each platelet. Biofilm architecture was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. A cover of living mixed biofilm could be generated over 22 days on silicone and the maximum of 22% biofilm surface covering at day 22. However, less than 4% surface coverage was observed on the carboxymethyl chitosan - treated plates in the testing period. Scanning electron microscopy confirms that, on surfaces treated by carboxymethyl chitosan, the biofilm was less dense. In addition, there were fewer layers of cells and profuse cellular debris, together with degrading and morphologically altered yeast cells. Carboxymethyl chitosan may serve as a possible antibiofilm agent to limit biofilm formation on voice prostheses. NA Laryngoscope, 126:E404-E408, 2016.",
  "27306621": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance features of mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with left bundle branch block Patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) can exhibit mechanical dyssynchrony which may contribute to heart failure; such patients may benefit from cardiac resynchronization treatment (CRT). While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has become a common part of heart failure work-up, CMR features of mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with LBBB have not been well characterized. This study aims to investigate the potential of CMR to characterize mechanical features of LBBB. CMR examinations from 43 patients with LBBB on their electrocardiogram, but without significant focal structural abnormalities, and from 43 age- and gender -matched normal controls were retrospectively reviewed. The following mechanical features of LBBB were evaluated: septal flash (SF), apical rocking (AR), delayed aortic valve opening measured relative to both end-diastole (AVOED) and pulmonic valve opening (AVOPVO), delayed left-ventricular (LV) free-wall contraction, and curvatures of the septum and LV free-wall. Septal displacement curves were also generated, using feature -tracking techniques. The echocardiographic findings of LBBB were also reviewed in those subjects for whom they were available. LBBB was significantly associated with the presence of SF and AR; within the LBBB group, 79 % had SF and 65 % had AR. Delayed AVOED, AVOPVO, and delayed LV free-wall contraction were significantly associated with LBBB. AVOED and AVOPVO positively correlated with QRS duration and negatively correlated with ejection fraction. Hearts with electrocardiographic evidence of LBBB showed lower septal-to-LV free-wall curvature ratios at end-diastole compared to normal controls. CMR can be used to identify and evaluate mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with LBBB. None of the normal controls showed the mechanical features associated with LBBB. Moreover, not all patients with LBBB showed the same degree of mechanical dyssynchrony, which could have implications for CRT.",
  "27534355": "Mobility Experience of Persons with Visual Impairments in Indian Railway Station Environments Mobility for persons with visual impairments in Indian railway stations poses multidimensional challenges for access to an inclusive travel experience. India is a home to about twenty million persons with diverse disabilities out of which about five million are persons with visual impairments. Diversity of passenger movements on a railway station including persons with visual impairments requires a Universal Design approach to respond to the accessibility issues in these contexts. This research study is based on a series of live on-site experiences conducted along with persons with visual impairments at New Delhi Railway Station. It also includes the generic studies carried out with other diversities of railway passengers including aging, gender and diverse physical abilities. It employs research methods like ethnography, focus group interactions and trace study to develop a deeper understanding of human and spatial parameters of mobility in railway station environments. A Universal Design perspective with a holistic understanding remains critical to the foundation of this research study. While it deals in specific requirements of persons with visual impairments, it also brings an illustration of handling diversity on a railway station from a unique Indian perspective. It concludes by highlighting and reinterpreting the Universal Design India Principles integrating the needs of persons with visual impairments in railway station environments. Brief recommendation for an inclusive mobility experience on railway station forms a vital part of this grounded research study.",
  "28097508": "Preparation and evaluation of biopolymeric nanoparticles as drug delivery system in effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis The study purposes to evaluate nanocrystalline biopolymeric nanoparticles encapsulating methotrexate and dexamethasone with high biocompatibility, enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity. Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by ionic gelation, and Methotrexate (MTX) and Dexamethasone (DEX) were loaded during the preparation and screened for their in vitro efficacy in HEK and RAW264.7 cells, ex vivo and in vivo efficacy. FTIR confirmed the involvement of phosphoric group of sTPP with amine groups of chitosan and also role of hydrogen bonding involved in the preparation of MTXCHNP and DEXCHNP. Controlled release patterns coupled with diffusion of drug were observed in two different buffers (PBS) at pH 7.4 and pH 5.8. The IC50 for MTXCHNP for HEK was 26.1 μg/ml and 7.7 μg/ml for RAW 264.7 cells. In DEXCHNP, the IC50 was 20.12 μg/ml for HEK and 7.37 μg/ml for RAW264.7 cells. Enhanced uptake of FITC - CHNP by RAW cells indicated internalization of nanoparticles by phagocytosis. The enhanced release of drug at lower pH justified increased cytotoxicity. Negligible ex-vivo hemolysis indicated the higher biocompatibility of the nanoparticles. (99m)Tc - CHNP exhibited maximum absorption in blood circulation in 3 h, followed by hepatic metabolism and renal clearance. Higher in-vivo anti-arthritic activity and antioxidant activity was observed post-intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections by both MTXCHNP and DEXCHNP when compared to MTX (0.75 mg/Kg by i.p. route) and DEX (0.2 mg/Kg/ i.p. /daily) per se. The nanocrystalline biopolymeric nanoparticles were stable, biocompatible and have potential to be administered through i.p. route with minimal toxicity and high efficacy.",
  "27473951": "Assessing sex-differences and the effect of timing of vaccination on immunogenicity, reactogenicity and efficacy of vaccines in young children: study protocol for an individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials Disease incidence differs between males and females for some infectious or inflammatory diseases. Sex-differences in immune responses to some vaccines have also been observed, mostly to viral vaccines in adults. Little evidence is available on whether sex-differences occur in response to immunisation in infancy even though this is the age group in which most vaccines are administered. Factors other than sex, such as timing or coadministration of other vaccines, can also influence the immune response to vaccination. Individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of vaccines in healthy infants and young children will be conducted. Fully anonymised data from ∼170 randomised controlled trials of v accines for diphtheria, tetanus, Bordetella pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B, hepatitis B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and rotavirus will be combined for analysis. Outcomes include measures of immunogenicity (immunoglobulins), reactogenicity, safety and disease -specific clinical efficacy. Data from trials of vaccines containing similar components will be combined in hierarchical models and the effect of sex and timing of vaccinations estimated for each outcome separately. Systematic reviews of published estimates of sex-differences cannot adequately answer questions in this field since such comparisons are never the main purpose of a clinical trial, thus a large degree of reporting bias exists in the published literature. Recent improvements in the widespread availability of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials makes it feasible to conduct extensive individual participant data meta-analyses which were previously impossible, thereby reducing the effect of publication or reporting bias on the understanding of the infant immune response. Preliminary results will be available in 2016 with final results available in 2019. No ethics review is required for secondary analyses of anonymised data.",
  "28272254": "Real role of β-blockers in regression of left ventricular mass in hypertension patients: Bayesian network meta-analysis Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is commonly present in patients with hypertension (HT). According to the expert consensus document from American, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were recommended as 1st-line therapeutic drugs. However, none noticed the different efficacy between fat-soluble and selective β1-receptor blockers (FS-β-B) and other β-blockers on regression of LVH before. The aim of this analysis was to compare the efficacy of FS-β-B with the other 4 different classes of antihypertensive drugs (ACEI, ARBs, calcium channel blockers [CCBs], and diuretics) on regression of LVH. Relative trials were identified in the PubMed, Web of Science, OVID EBM Reviews and Cochrane databases, and the relevant papers were examined. We performed both traditional and Bayesian meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about the regression of LVH. Sensitivity analysis and regression analysis were performed to explore possible sources of heterogeneity. Inconsistency analysis was performed to check whether the analysis of the trials in the network was indeed consistent. A total of 41 RCTs involving 2566 patients with HT and LVH were included in this analysis. Bayesian network meta-analysis indicated no statistically significant differences between these groups: FS-β-B and ACEI (MD, -7.09; 95% CI, -14.99, 1.27); FS-β-B and ARB (MD, -2.66; 95% Cl, -12.02, 6.31). Although FS-β-B showed greater efficacy when compared with diuretic (MD, 13.04; 95% CI, 3.38, 22.59) or CCB (MD, 10.90; 95% CI, 1.98, 19.49). The probabilities of being among the most efficacious treatments were: FS-β-B (72%), ARB (27%), ACEI (0.01%), CCB (0.00%), and diuretic (0.00%). Evidence from our analysis reveals that FS-β-B have potential to become 1st-line therapeutic drugs in HT and LVH patients. However, the real efficacy of FS-β-B on regression of LVH should be confirmed by further large, high quality trials considering the limitation of the study number.",
  "27442784": "Placental Pathologic Associations with Morbidly Adherent Placenta: Potential insights into Pathogenesis The pathology that underlies morbidly adherent placenta (MAP) is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to describe the placental pathology, especially implantation site pathology, associated with MAP. This was a single institution, retrospective case-control study design examining placentas of patients who delivered between January 2008 and September 2013. MAP cases were defined by the need for clinical intervention at delivery beyond spontaneous placental delivery or simple manual extraction of the placenta. Controls consisted of patients with placentas sent for examination due to a history of maternal malignancy with no clinical suspicion of accreta. Placental pathologic findings of maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU), acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, fetal vascular obstruction and hemorrhage were recorded and compared using bivariable and multivariable analyses. Three categories of pathologic changes were seen more commonly in MAP placentas (N=101) than control placentas (N=110): chronic basal inflammation, villous changes of MVU and retromembranous and retromembranous / intervillous hemorrhage. In multivariable analyses adjusted for confounders, chronic basal villitis (aOR 5.6, 1.73-18.18), plasma cell deciduitis (aOR 2.63, 1.08-6.39), increased syncytial knots (aOR 3.92, 1.57-9.75), villous agglutination (aOR 24.85, 2.78-221.75), increased perivillous fibrin (aOR 5.08, 1.49-17.34), and the presence of subchorionic / intervillous thrombi (aOR 4.01, 1.63-9.86) remained associated with MAP. MAP is highly associated with evidence of intraparenchymal placental hemorrhage villous changes of MVU, and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate at the implantation site. The contribution of this basal chronic inflammatory infiltrate to MAP requires further investigation.",
  "28454482": "Effects of Environmental Factors and Metallic Electrodes on AC Electrical Conduction Through DNA Molecule Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is one of the best candidate materials for various device applications such as in electrodes for rechargeable batteries, biosensors, molecular electronics, medical - and biomedical - applications etc. Hence, it is worthwhile to examine the mechanism of charge transport in the DNA molecule, however, still a question without a clear answer is DNA a molecular conducting material (wire), semiconductor, or insulator? The answer, after the published data, is still ambiguous without any confirmed and clear scientific answer. DNA is found to be always surrounded with different electric charges, ions, and dipoles. These surrounding charges and electric barrier(s) due to metallic electrodes (as environmental factors (EFs)) play a substantial role when measuring the electrical conductivity through λ-double helix (DNA) molecule suspended between metallic electrodes. We found that strong frequency dependence of AC - complex conductivity comes from the electrical conduction of EFs. This leads to superimposing serious incorrect experimental data to measured ones. At 1 MHz, we carried out a first control experiment on electrical conductivity with and without the presence of DNA molecule. If there are possible electrical conduction due to stray ions and contribution of substrate, we will detected them. This control experiment revealed that there is an important role played by the environmental - charges around DNA molecule and any experiment should consider this role. We have succeeded to measure both electrical conductivity due to EFs (σ ENV) and electrical conductivity due to DNA molecule (σ DNA) independently by carrying the measurements at different DNA - lengths and subtracting the data. We carried out measurements as a function of frequency (f) and temperature (T) in the ranges 0.1 Hz < f < 1 MHz and 288 K < T < 343 K. The measured conductivity (σ MES) portrays a metal -like behavior at high frequencies near 1 MHz. However, we found that σ DNA was far from this behavior because the conduction due to EFs superimposes σ DNA, in particular at low frequencies. By measuring the electrical conductivity at different lengths: 40, 60, 80, and 100 nm, we have succeeded not only to separate the electrical conduction of the DNA molecule from all EFs effects that surround the molecule, but also to present accurate values of σ DNA and the dielectric constant of the molecule ε'DNA as a function of temperature and frequency. Furthermore, in order to explain these data, we present a model describing the electrical conduction through DNA molecule: DNA is a classical semiconductor with charges, dipoles and ions that result in creation of localized energy - states (LESs) in the extended bands and in the energy gap of the DNA molecule. This model explains clearly the mechanism of charge transfer mechanism in the DNA, and it sheds light on why the charge transfer through the DNA can lead to insulating, semiconducting, or metallic behavior on the same time. The model considers charges on DNA, in the extended bands, either could be free to move under electric field or localized in potential wells/hills. Localization of charges in DNA is an intrinsic structural - property of this solitaire molecule. At all temperatures, the expected increase in thermal - induced charge is attributed to the delocalization of holes (or/and electrons) in potential hills (or/and potential wells) which accurately accounts for the total electric and dielectric behavior through DNA molecule. We succeeded to fit the experiment al data to the proposed model with reasonable magnitudes of potential hills/wells that are in the energy range from 0.068 eV.",
  "27865242": "A study on knowledge and awareness about tuberculosis in senior school children in Bangalore, India Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), commonly affecting the lungs. All health care professionals including the pharmacists provide a valuable public health role in promoting community awareness of TB particularly in reducing stigma attached to TB. Thus, creating awareness at a community level could play a vital role in control and prevention of TB. To determine whether educational intervention would affect the level of TB awareness among students of selected schools and pre-university colleges (PUCs) in Bangalore urban and Bangalore rural regions. The present study was conducted among the students of 8th, 9th, 10th and PUC in Bangalore rural and urban jurisdiction (n=2635). A questionnaire was designed in English and Kannada language, consisting of 20 questions with multiple-choice answers. A 30- minute visual health education was given on TB in English, followed by general pictorial presentation, and the data were collected as pre-test and post-test. Data collected from 2635 participants during pre - and post - education session revealed that mean score improved from 8.77±2.59 to 14.95±1.99. Impact of the education session showed a significant knowledge improvement about TB from 1.59% (pre - education) to 49.67% (post - education). The present study clearly demonstrated that a simple, 30- minute health education session did have a positive impact on knowledge and awareness about TB among school children as observed with increase in mean knowledge score from pre-test to post-test, indicating that empowerment of students could guide the community on various aspects of TB.",
  "28166607": "Recombinant fibrinogen reveals the differential roles of α- and γ-chain cross-linking and molecular heterogeneity in fibrin clot strain-stiffening Essentials Fibrinogen circulates in human plasma as a complex mixture of heterogeneous molecular variants. We measured strain-stiffening of recombinantly produced fibrinogen upon clotting. Factor XIII and molecular heterogeneity alter clot elasticity at the protofibril and fiber level. This highlights the hitherto unknown role of molecular composition in fibrin clot mechanics. Background Fibrin plays a crucial role in haemostasis and wound healing by forming strain-stiffening fibrous networks that reinforce blood clots. The molecular origin of fibrin's strain-stiffening behavior remains poorly understood, primarily because plasma fibrinogen is a complex mixture of heterogeneous molecular variants and is often contaminated by plasma factors that affect clot properties. Objectives and methods To facilitate mechanistic dissection of fibrin nonlinear elasticity, we produced a homogeneous recombinant fibrinogen corresponding to the main variant in human plasma, termed rFib610. We characterized the structure of rFib610 clots using turbidimetry, microscopy and X-ray scattering. We used rheology to measure the strain-stiffening behavior of the clots and determined the fiber properties by modeling the clots as semi-flexible polymer networks. Results We show that addition of FXIII to rFib610 clots causes a dose-dependent stiffness increase at small deformations and renders the strain-stiffening response reversible. We find that γ-chain cross-linking contributes to clot elasticity by changing the force-extension behavior of the protofibrils, whereas α-chain cross-linking stiffens the fibers, as a consequence of tighter coupling between the constituent protofibrils. Interestingly, rFib610 protofibrils have a 25% larger bending rigidity than plasma -purified fibrin protofibrils and a delayed strain-stiffening, indicating that molecular heterogeneity influences clot mechanics at the protofibril scale. Conclusions Fibrinogen molecular heterogeneity and FXIII affect the mechanical function of fibrin clots by altering the nonlinear viscoelastic properties at the protofibril and fiber scale. This work provides a starting point to investigate the role of molecular heterogeneity of plasma fibrinogen in fibrin clot mechanics and haemostasis.",

The melanopsin - mediated light signaling pathway may contribute to seasonal variation and can be measured non-invasively by pupillometry. We prospectively studied changes in melanopsin - mediated pupillary constriction in 19 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 10 control across the summer and winter solstices. The melanopsin - mediated response, as measured by the pupil's sustained constriction six s after a high intensity blue light stimulus, was marginally attenuated in those with MDD relative to controls (p =0.071). The participants with MDD unexpectedly showed a significantly reduced transient pupillary response to low intensity red (p =0.011) and blue light (p =0.013), but not high intensity red and blue light. Sustained pupillary constriction in response to high intensity blue light was more pronounced with increasing daylight hours (p =0.037) and was more strongly related to objectively measured versus estimated light exposure. Melanopsin - mediated impairments in pupil response may serve as a biological marker for vulnerability to depression in low light conditions. Assessment of these and other responses to light stimuli, such as response to low intensity light, may be useful for the study of the neurobiology of MDD and related mood disorders.",

Previous studies have shown conflicting data about predictors of hypocalcemia after these procedures. The objective of this study was to investigate whether ionized calcium (iCa) concentrations before treatment are predictive of hypocalcemia or its clinical signs after surgical removal or heat ablation in dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism. Fifty-four dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism (29 female, 25 male; 49 retrospective, 5 prospective). Dogs were enrolled if they met the inclusion criteria: persistent hypercalcemia (iCa >1.41 mmol/L) due to primary hyperparathyroidism and absence of preemptive calcitriol treatment. All dogs were treated with parathyroidectomy (n = 37) or percutaneous ultrasound-guided heat ablation (n = 17). After treatment, iCa was monitored twice daily until plateau or intervention. There was a moderate correlation between before - treatment hypercalcemia and after-treatment hypocalcemia. The prospective study was terminated due to ethical concerns given findings in the retrospective section. All dogs were placed into groups according to their pretreatment iCa: 1.46-1.61 mmol/L, 1.62-1.71 mmol/L, iCa 1.72-1.81 mmol/L, or >1.81 mmol/L. After treatment, the mean lowest iCa for each group, respectively, was 1.19, 1.18, 1.13, and 1.01 mmol/L. There was a significant association between higher group and proportion of dogs with iCa <1.00 mmol/L (P = .014). This study demonstrates a moderate correlation between iCa concentration before treatment and hypocalcemia after treatment. Dogs with higher initial iCa concentrations should be treated to prevent rapid decline and development of clinical hypocalcemia.",

Moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation. 2 ESGE / EASL suggest that ERCP can be considered if MRC plus liver biopsy is equivocal or contraindicated in patients with persisting clinical suspicion of PSC. The risks of ERCP have to be weighed against the potential benefit with regard to surveillance and treatment recommendations. Low quality evidence, weak recommendation. 6 ESGE / EASL suggest that, in patients with an established diagnosis of PSC, MRC should be considered before therapeutic ERCP. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 7 ESGE / EASL suggest performing endoscopic treatment with concomitant ductal sampling (brush cytology, endobiliary biopsies) of suspected significant strictures identified at MRC in PSC patients who present with symptoms likely to improve following endoscopic treatment. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 9 ESGE / EASL recommend weighing the anticipated benefits of biliary papillotomy / sphincterotomy against its risks on a case-by-case basis.

  "27858503": "High-throughput sequencing of two populations of extracellular vesicles provides an mRNA signature that can be detected in the circulation of breast cancer patients Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain a wide range of RNA types with a reported prevalence of non-coding RNA. To date a comprehensive characterization of the protein coding transcripts in EVs is still lacking. We performed RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of 2 EV populations and identified a small fraction of transcripts that were expressed at significantly different levels in large oncosomes and exosomes, suggesting they may mediate specialized functions. However, these 2 EV populations exhibited a common mRNA signature that, in comparison to their donor cells, was significantly enriched in mRNAs encoding E2F transcriptional targets and histone proteins. These mRNAs are primarily expressed in the S-phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that they may be packaged into EVs during S-phase. In silico analysis using subcellular compartment transcriptome data from the ENCODE cell line compendium revealed that EV mRNAs originate from a cytoplasmic RNA pool. The EV signature was independently identified in plasma of patients with breast cancer by RNA-Seq. Furthermore, several transcripts differentially expressed in EVs from patients versus controls mirrored differential expression between normal and breast cancer tissues. Altogether, this largest high-throughput profiling of EV mRNA demonstrates that EVs carry tumor-specific alterations and can be interrogated as a source of cancer-derived cargo.",
  "27884163": "Chronic adiponectin deficiency leads to Alzheimer's disease -like cognitive impairments and pathologies through AMPK inactivation and cerebral insulin resistance in aged mice Insulin resistance is the major pathogenesis underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and these patients have doubled risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence suggests that insulin resistance plays an important role in AD pathogenesis, possibly due to abnormal GSK3β activation, causing intra- and extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation. Adiponectin (APN) is an adipokine with insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects. Reduced circulatory APN level is associated with insulin resistance and T2DM. The role of APN in AD has not been elucidated. In this study, we aim to examine if adiponectin deficiency would lead to cerebral insulin resistance, cognitive decline and Alzheimer's-like pathology in mice. To study the role of adiponectin in cognitive functions, we employed adiponectin-knockout (APN-KO) mice and demonstrated chronic APN deficiency in their CNS. Behavioral tests were performed to study the cognitions of male APN-KO mice. Brains and tissue lysates were collected to study the pathophysiological and molecular changes in the brain of APN-KO mice. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line was used to study the molecular mechanism upon APN and insulin treatment. Aged APN -deficient mice displayed spatial memory and learning impairments, fear-conditioned memory deficit as well as anxiety. These mice also developed AD pathologies including increased cerebral Aβ42 level, Aβ deposition, hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins, microgliosis and astrogliosis with increased cerebral IL-1β and TNFα levels that associated with increased neuronal apoptosis and reduced synaptic proteins levels, suggesting APN deficiency may lead to neuronal and synaptic loss in the brain. AD pathologies -associated APN - KO mice displayed attenuated AMPK phosphorylation and impaired insulin signaling including decreased Akt induction and increased GSK3β activation in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Aged APN -KO mice developed hippocampal insulin resistance with reduced pAkt induction upon intracerebral insulin injection. Consistently, APN treatment in SH-SY5Y cells with insulin resistance and overexpressing Aβ induce higher pAkt levels through AdipoR1 upon insulin treatment whereas the induction was blocked by compound C, indicating APN can enhance neuronal insulin sensitivity through AMPK activation. Our results indicated that chronic APN deficiency inactivated AMPK causing insulin desensitization and elicited AD-like pathogenesis in aged mice which also developed significant cognitive impairments and psychiatric symptoms.",

A total of 168 trial publications were included. Most trials concluded non-inferiority (132; 79%). The non-inferiority margin was reported for 98% (164), but less than half reported any justification for the margin (77; 46%).

  "27547341": "Fitness implications of seasonal climate variation in Columbian ground squirrels The influence of climate change on the fitness of wild populations is often studied in the context of the spring onset of the reproductive season. This focus is relevant for climate influences on reproductive success, but neglects other fitness -relevant periods (e.g., autumn preparation for overwintering). We examined variation in climate variables (temperature, rainfall, snowfall, and snowpack) across the full annual cycle of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus) for 21 years. We investigated seasonal climate variables that were associated with fitness variables, climate variables that exhibited directional changes across the study period, and finally observed declines in fitness (-0.03 units/year; total decline = 37%) that were associated with directional changes in climate variables. Annual fitness of adult female ground squirrels was positively associated with spring temperature (r = 0.69) and early summer rainfall (r = 0.56) and negatively associated with spring snow conditions (r = -0.44 to -0.66). Across the 21 years, spring snowmelt has become significantly delayed (r = 0.48) and summer rainfall became significantly reduced (r = -0.53). Using a standardized partial regression model, we found that directional changes in the timing of spring snowmelt and early summer rainfall (i.e., progressively drier summers) had moderate influences on annual fitness, with the latter statistically significant (ρ = -0.314 and 0.437, respectively). The summer period corresponds to prehibernation fattening of young and adult ground squirrels. Had we focused on a single point in time (viz. the onset of the breeding season), we would have underestimated the influences of climate change on our population. Rather, we obtained a comprehensive understanding of the influences of climate change on individual fitness by investigating the full lifecycle.",
  "28472129": "Copy number variation of FCGR genes in etiopathogenesis of sarcoidosis We have previously revealed that, in contrast to polymorphism of FCGR2B and FCGR3B, polymorphism of FCGR2A, FCGR2C and FCGR3A genes, encoding receptors for Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G (Fcγ receptors), play a role in increased level of circulating immune complexes with occurrence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock proteins in patients with sarcoidosis. However, this immunocomplexemia might also be caused by decreased clearance by immune cells due to a changed copy number of FCGR genes. Thus, the next step of our study was to evaluate copy number variation of FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR2C, FCGR3A and FCGR3B in this disease. The analysis was carried out by real-time quantitative PCR on 104 patients and 110 healthy volunteers. Despite previously detected variation in allele / genotype frequencies of FCGR in sarcoidosis and its particular stages, there was no copy number variation of the tested genes between sarcoidosis or its stages and healthy control, as well as between stages themselves. A relevant increase in copy number of FCGR2C and FCGR3B in Stage IV of sarcoidosis vs. other stages and controls was detected, but this observation was based on a limited number of Stage IV patients. Hence, polymorphism of FCGR genes seems to be more important than their copy number variation in etiopathogenesis of sarcoidosis in patients from the Polish population.",
  "27391263": "Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of tumor tissue and circulating tumor cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A report from the PETRUS prospective study Molecular characterization of cancer samples is hampered by tumor tissue availability in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. We reported the results of prospective PETRUS study of biomarker assessment in paired primary prostatic tumors, metastatic biopsies and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Among 54 mCRPC patients enrolled, 38 (70%) had biopsies containing more than 50% tumour cells. 28 (52%) patients were analyzed for both tissue samples and CTCs. FISH for AR - amplification and TMPRSS2 - ERG translocation were successful in 54% and 32% in metastatic biopsies and primary tumors, respectively. By comparing CellSearch and filtration (ISET)-enrichment combined to four color immunofluorescent staining, we showed that CellSearch and ISET isolated distinct subpopulations of CTCs: CTCs undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, CTC clusters and large CTCs with cytomorphological characteristics but no detectable markers were isolated using ISET. Epithelial CTCs detected by the CellSearch were mostly lost during the ISET-filtration. AR - amplification was detected in CellSearch -captured CTCs, but not in ISET -enriched CTCs which harbor exclusively AR gain of copies. Eighty-eight percent concordance for ERG-rearrangement was observed between metastatic biopsies and CTCs even if additional ERG-alteration patterns were detected in ISET -enriched CTCs indicating a higher heterogeneity in CTCs. Molecular screening of metastatic biopsies is achievable in a multicenter context. Our data indicate that CTCs detected by the CellSearch and the ISET-filtration systems are not only phenotypically but also genetically different. Close attention must be paid to CTC characterization since neither approach tested here fully reflects the tremendous phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity present in CTCs from mCRPC patients.",

Deregulated JAK2 signaling has emerged as the central phenotypic driver of BCR -ABL1-negative MPNs and a unifying therapeutic target. In addition, MPNs show unexpected layers of genetic complexity, with multiple abnormalities associated with disease progression, interactions between inherited factors and phenotype driver mutations, and effects related to the order in which mutations are acquired. Although morphology and clinical laboratory analysis continue to play an important role in defining these conditions, genomic analysis is providing a platform for better disease definition, more accurate diagnosis, direction of therapy, and refined prognostication. There is an emerging consensus with regard to many prognostic factors, but there is a clear need to synthesize genomic findings into robust, clinically actionable and widely accepted scoring systems as well as the need to standardize the laboratory methodologies that are used.",
  "27887026": "Chaetomium thermophilum formate dehydrogenase has high activity in the reduction of hydrogen carbonate (HCO3 -) to formate While formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) have been used for cofactor recycling in chemoenzymatic synthesis, the ability of FDH to reduce CO2 could also be utilized in the conversion of CO2 to useful products via formate (HCOO(-)). In this study, we investigated the reduction of CO2 in the form of hydrogen carbonate (HCO3(-)) to formate by FDHs from Candida methylica (CmFDH) and Chaetomium thermophilum (CtFDH) in a NADH -dependent reaction. The catalytic performance with HCO3(-) as a substrate was evaluated by measuring the kinetic rates and conducting productivity assays. CtFDH showed a higher efficiency in converting HCO3(-) to formate than CmFDH, whereas CmFDH was better in the oxidation of formate. The pH optimum of the reduction was at pH 7-8. However, the high concentrations of HCO3(-) reduced the reaction rate. CtFDH was modeled in the presence of HCO3(-) showing that it fits to the active site. The active site setting for hydride transfer in CO2 reduction was modeled. The hydride donated by NADH would form a favorable contact to the carbon atom of HCO3(-), resulting in a surplus of electrons within the molecule. This would cause the complex formed by hydrogen carbonate and the hydride to break into formate and hydroxide ions.",
  "27802488": "In Vivo 3-Dimensional Strain Mapping Confirms Large Optic Nerve Head Deformations Following Horizontal Eye Movements To measure lamina cribrosa (LC) strains (deformations) following abduction and adduction in healthy subjects and to compare them with those resulting from a relatively high acute intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. A total of 16 eyes from 8 healthy subjects were included. Among the 16 eyes, 11 had peripapillary atrophy (PPA). For each subject, both optic nerve heads (ONHs) were imaged using optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline (twice), in different gaze positions (adduction and abduction of 20°) and following an acute IOP elevation of approximately 20 mm Hg from baseline (via ophthalmodynamometry). Strains of LC for all loading scenarios were mapped using a three-dimensional tracking algorithm. In all 16 eyes, LC strains induced by adduction and abduction were 5.83% ± 3.78% and 3.93% ± 2.57%, respectively, and both significantly higher than the control strains measured from the repeated baseline acquisitions (P < 0.01). Strains of LC in adduction were on average higher than those in abduction, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). Strains of LC induced by IOP elevations (on average 21.13 ± 7.61 mm Hg) were 6.41% ± 3.21% and significantly higher than the control strains (P < 0.0005). Gaze - induced LC strains in the PPA group were on average larger than those in the non-PPA group; however, the relationship was not statistically significant. Our results confirm that horizontal eye movements generate significant ONH strains, which is consistent with our previous estimations using finite element analysis. Further studies are needed to explore a possible link between ONH strains induced by eye movements and axonal loss in optic neuropathies.",
  "27601594": "Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Ovarian Cancer Results in Three Patterns of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Response with Distinct Implications for Immunotherapy Purpose: Some forms of chemotherapy can enhance antitumor immunity through immunogenic cell death, resulting in increased T-cell activation and tumor infiltration. Such effects could potentially sensitize tumors to immunotherapies, including checkpoint blockade. We investigated whether platinum - and taxane -based chemotherapy for ovarian cancer induces immunologic changes consistent with this possibility. Experimental Design: Matched pre - and post - neoadjuvant chemotherapy tumor samples from 26 high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for a large panel of immune cells and associated factors. The prognostic significance of post - chemotherapy TIL patterns was assessed in an expanded cohort (n = 90).Results: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with increased densities of CD3 (+), CD8 (+), CD8 (+) TIA-1 (+), PD-1 (+) and CD20 (+) TIL. Other immune subsets and factors were unchanged, including CD79a (+) CD138 (+) plasma cells, CD68 (+) macrophages, and MHC class I on tumor cells. Immunosuppressive cell types were also unchanged, including FoxP3 (+) PD-1 (+) cells (putative regulatory T cells), IDO-1 (+) cells, and PD-L1 (+) cells (both macrophages and tumor cells). Hierarchical clustering revealed three response patterns: (i) TIL (high) tumors showed increases in multiple immune markers after chemotherapy; (ii) TIL (low) tumors underwent similar increases, achieving patterns indistinguishable from the first group; and (iii) TIL (negative) cases generally remained negative. Despite the dramatic increases seen in the first two patterns, post- chemotherapy TIL showed limited prognostic significance.Conclusions: Chemotherapy augments pre-existing TIL responses but fails to relieve major immune-suppressive mechanisms or confer significant prognostic benefit. Our findings provide rationale for multipronged approaches to immunotherapy tailored to the baseline features of the tumor microenvironment. Clin Cancer Res; 23(4); 925-34. ©2016 AACR.",

  "28165368": "Reducing Low Birth Weight among African Americans in the Midwest: A Look at How Faith - Based Organizations Are Poised to Inform and Influence Health Communication on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) Low birth weight (LBW) rates remain the highest among African Americans despite public health efforts to address these disparities; with some of the highest racial disparities in the Midwest (Kansas). The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) perspective offers an explanation for how LBW contributes to racial health disparities among African Americans and informs a community directed health communication framework for creating sustainable programs to address these disparities. Trusted community organizations such as faith - based organizations are well situated to explain health communication gaps that may occur over the life course. These entities are underutilized in core health promotion programming targeting underserved populations and can prove essential for addressing developmental origins of LBW among African Americans. Extrapolating from focus group data collected from African American church populations as part of a social marketing health promotion project on cancer prevention, we theoretically consider how a similar communication framework and approach may apply to address LBW disparities. Stratified focus groups (n = 9) were used to discover emergent themes about disease prevention, and subsequently applied to explore how faith - based organizations (FBOs) inform strategic health care (media) advocacy and health promotion that potentially apply to address LBW among African Americans. We argue that FBOs are poised to meet health promotion and health communication needs among African American women who face social barriers in health.",
  "27994578": "Comparative In silico Analysis of Butyrate Production Pathways in Gut Commensals and Pathogens Biosynthesis of butyrate by commensal bacteria plays a crucial role in maintenance of human gut health while dysbiosis in gut microbiome has been linked to several enteric disorders. Contrastingly, butyrate shows cytotoxic effects in patients with oral diseases like periodontal infections and oral cancer. In addition to these host associations, few syntrophic bacteria couple butyrate degradation with sulfate reduction and methane production. Thus, it becomes imperative to understand the distribution of butyrate metabolism pathways and delineate differences in substrate utilization between pathogens and commensals. The bacteria utilize four pathways for butyrate production with different initial substrates (Pyruvate, 4-aminobutyrate, Glutarate and Lysine) which follow a polyphyletic distribution. A comprehensive mining of complete / draft bacterial genomes indicated conserved juxtaposed genomic arrangement in all these pathways. This gene context information was utilized for an accurate annotation of butyrate production pathways in bacterial genomes. Interestingly, our analysis showed that inspite of a beneficial impact of butyrate in gut, not only commensals, but a few gut pathogens also possess butyrogenic pathways. The results further illustrated that all the gut commensal bacteria (Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Butyrivibrio, and commensal species of Clostridia etc) ferment pyruvate for butyrate production. On the contrary, the butyrogenic gut pathogen Fusobacterium utilizes different amino acid metabolism pathways like those for Glutamate (4-aminobutyrate and Glutarate) and Lysine for butyrogenesis which leads to a concomitant release of harmful by-products like ammonia in the process. The findings in this study indicate that commensals and pathogens in gut have divergently evolved to produce butyrate using distinct pathways. No such evolutionary selection was observed in oral pathogens (Porphyromonas and Filifactor) which showed presence of pyruvate as well as amino acid fermenting pathways which might be because the final product butyrate is itself known to be cytotoxic in oral diseases. This differential utilization of butyrogenic pathways in gut pathogens and commensals has an enormous ecological impact taking into consideration the immense influence of butyrate on different disorders in humans. The results of this study can potentially guide bioengineering experiments to design therapeutics / probiotics by manipulation of butyrate biosynthesis gene clusters in bacteria.",
  "27570111": "Glucose metabolism - weighted imaging with chemical exchange-sensitive MRI of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) in brain: Sensitivity and biological sources Recent proof-of-principle studies have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the uptake and metabolism of non-labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) by a chemical exchange-sensitive spin-lock (CESL) MRI approach. In order to gain better understanding of this new approach, we performed dynamic in vivo CESL MRI on healthy rat brains with an intravenous injection of 2DG under various conditions at 9.4T. For three 2DG doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1g/kg, we found that 2DG - CESL signals increased linearly with injection dose at the initial (<20min) but not the later period (>40min) suggesting time-dependent differential weightings of 2DG transport and metabolism. Remaining 2DG - CESL studies were performed with 0.25g/kg 2DG. Since a higher isoflurane level reduces glucose metabolism and increases blood flow, 2DG - CESL was measured under 0.5%, 1.5% and 2.2% isoflurane. The 2DG - CESL signal was reduced at higher isoflurane levels correlating well with the 2DG phosphorylation in the intracellular space. To detect regional heterogeneities of glucose metabolism, 2DG - CESL with 0.33×0.33×1.50mm(3) resolution was obtained, which indeed showed a higher response in the cortex compared to the corpus callosum. Lastly, unlike CESL MRI with the injection of non-transportable mannitol, the 2DG - CESL response decreased with an increased spin-lock pulse power confirming that 2DG - CESL is dominated by chemical exchange processes in the extravascular space. Taken together, our results showed that 2DG - CESL MRI signals mainly indicate glucose transport and metabolism and may be a useful biomarker for metabolic studies of normal and diseased brains.",

Here, we report the case of a 54-year- old female admitted with a painful ulcer on the sole of the right foot which was initially treated with empirical antibiotics and debridement. The disease was found to spread rapidly after each debridement. The culture reports were negative; rheumatology workup and Doppler study were within normal limits. A clinical suspicion of PG was made and was confirmed with tissue biopsy. She was started on oral steroids following which she dramatically improved. Thus, when a patient presents with a rapidly expanding painful ulcer in a vascular limb that is refractory to antibiotic treatment and exacerbating on debridement, it is imperative to consider the possibility of PG.",

Our analyses indicated that sustained maternal responsivity had a significant positive impact on the trajectories of communication and to a lesser extent other adaptive behavior domains through middle childhood with many effects remaining significant after controlling for autism symptoms and developmental level. For children who showed declines in adaptive behavior during middle childhood, sustained high levels of maternal responsivity minimized the amount of decline observed in the communication, socialization, and daily living domains.",

Virtually all lymphomas and plasma cell dyscrasias can show kidney involvement, including parenchymal infiltration and by secondary injury. Recently, a unique form of glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits has been reported, which shows frequent association with hematopoietic neoplasia and a propensity for progressive kidney disease. In many instances, these cases are likely diagnosed as glomerulonephritis with dominant C3 due to the absence of immunoglobulin staining by routine immunofluorescence microscopy. The patient reported here showed lymphomatous infiltration on kidney biopsy and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with dominant staining for C3 without immunoglobulins on initial immunofluorescence; however, monotypic immunoglobulin G κ light chain was revealed after additional immunofluorescence staining was performed on the paraffin-embedded tissue.

This is a report of a chronic renal failure patient who had sustained bilateral intra-capsular displaced fracture neck of femur following an episode of convulsion and the difficulties encountered in early diagnosis and treatment. The pathophysiology of renal osteodystrophy and the treatment of hip fractures in patients with renal failure are also discussed. A 23 years old male patient admitted with h/o dysuria, pyuria and loss of appetite since 3 months. He was a known case of chronic renal failure and reflux nephropathy. On investigating, patient's renal parameters were high and he was started with haemodialysis. The next day patient had c/o bilateral hip pain and inability to move bilateral lower limbs following an episode of seizure. Radiograph of pelvis showed vertical sub capital fractures of bilateral neck of femur. In this patient, considering his age, general condition & prognosis, an elective surgery in the form of bilateral uncemented modular bipolar hemiarthroplasty was done. Overall risk of hip fracture among patients with chronic renal failure is considerably higher than in the general population, independent of age and gender. Simultaneous spontaneous bilateral fractures of the femoral neck are rare and a delayed diagnosis is usual. The study of etiological factors of these fractures is essential to guide us in choosing the treatment of choice.

  "28286864": "In Vivo Expansion of Melanoma -Specific T Cells Using Microneedle Arrays Coated with Immune-Polyelectrolyte Multilayers Microneedles (MNs) are micron-scale polymeric or metallic structures that offer distinct advantages for vaccines by efficiently targeting skin -resident immune cells, eliminating injection-associated pain, and improving patient compliance. These advantages, along with recent studies showing therapeutic benefits achieved using traditional intradermal injections in human cancer patients, suggest MN delivery might enhance cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. We recently developed a new class of polyelectrolyte multilayers based on the self-assembly of model peptide antigens and molecular toll-like receptor agonists (TLRa) into ultrathin, conformal coatings. Here, we reasoned that these immune polyelectrolyte multilayers (iPEMs) might be a useful platform for assembling cancer vaccine components on MN arrays for intradermal delivery from these substrates. Using conserved human melanoma antigens and a potent TLRa vaccine adjuvant, CpG, we show that iPEMs can be assembled on MNs in an automated fashion. These films, prepared with up to 128 layers, are approximately 200 nm thick but provide cancer vaccine cargo loading >225 μg/cm(2). In cell culture, iPEM cargo released from MNs is internalized by primary dendritic cells, promotes activation of these cells, and expands T cells during coculture. In mice, application of iPEM -coated MNs results in the codelivery of tumor antigen and CpG through the skin, expanding tumor -specific T cells during initial MN applications and resulting in larger memory recall responses during a subsequent booster MN application. This study support MNs coated with PEMs built from tumor vaccine components as a well-defined, modular system for generating tumor -specific immune responses, enabling new approaches that can be explored in combination with checkpoint blockade or other combination cancer therapies.",

The database search employed the following key words: \" topical fluorides \" AND \" children \" AND \" clinical trials \"; \" topical fluorides \" OR \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" randomized controlled trial \"; \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" children \" OR \" primary dentition \" AND \" tooth decay \"; \" silver diamine fluoride \" OR \" sodium fluoride varnish \" AND \" early childhood caries \"; and \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" children \". Inclusion criteria were articles published in English, from 2005 to January 2016, on clinical studies using SDF as a treatment intervention to evaluate caries arrest in children with primary dentition and/or permanent first molars. Database searches provided 821 eligible publications, of which 33 met the inclusion criteria. After the abstracts were prescreened, 25 articles were dismissed based on exclusion criteria. The remaining 8 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 7 publications were included in the SR. These included 1 study assessing the effectiveness of SDF at different concentrations; 3 studies comparing SDF with other interventions; 2 investigations comparing SDF at different application frequencies and with other interventions; and 1 study comparing semiannual SDF applications versus a control group. The literature indicates that SDF is a preventive treatment for dental caries in community settings. At concentrations of 30% and 38%, SDF shows potential as an alternative treatment for caries arrest in the primary dentition and permanent first molars. To establish guidelines, more studies are needed to fully assess the effectiveness of SDF and to determine the appropriate application frequency.",

They are vulnerable to psychiatric illness. The objective of this study was to see the prevalence and type of psychiatric disorders in institutionalized female juvenile offenders and non-offenders of same age, sex and socioeconomic group in the community. The association of mental disorders was examined in 43 female inmates of Juvenile Development Centers and 43 randomly selected comparison subjects in community. One stage-structured assessment of psychopathology was carried out by using a structured and valid Bangla version of the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). Development and Well-Being Assessment generated psychiatric diagnosis was assigned based on ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for research. The result revealed that, of those who were in conflict with law, 93% had mental disorder, whereas 14% of non-offenders had psychiatric disorder. Among the offenders with psychiatric disorders, most of them (32.6%) suffered from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), followed by combined MDD & Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). On the other hand, among the non-offenders with psychiatric disorder 9.3% suffered from MDD. It can be concluded that considerable psychiatric disorders are prevalent among the female juvenile offenders with comparison to non-offenders.

  "28244917": "In Vivo Three-Dimensional Patellar Mechanics: Normal Knees Compared with Domed and Anatomic Patellar Components Patellofemoral complications are a major cause of revision surgery following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). High forces occurring at the patellofemoral articulation coupled with a small patellofemoral contact area pose substantial design challenges. In this study, the three-dimensional (3D) in vivo mechanics of domed and anatomically shaped patellar components were compared with those of native patellae. Ten normal knees, 10 treated with an LCS-PS (low contact stress-posterior stabilized) TKA (anatomically shaped patellar component), and 10 treated with a PFC Sigma RP-PS (press-fit condylar Sigma rotating platform-posterior stabilized) TKA (domed patellar component) were analyzed under fluoroscopic surveillance while the patient performed a weight-bearing deep knee bend from full knee extension to maximum knee flexion. Relevant bone geometries were segmented out from computed tomography (CT) scans, and computer-assisted-design (CAD) models of the implanted components were obtained from the manufacturer. Three-dimensional patellofemoral kinematics were obtained using a 3D -to- 2D registration process. Contact mechanics were calculated using a distance map between the articulating patellar and femoral surfaces. Both patellar component designs exhibited good rotational kinematics and tracked well within the femoral trochlea when compared with the normal patella. The contact areas in the TKA groups peaked at 60° of knee flexion (mean and standard deviation, 201 ± 63.4 mm for the LCS-PS group and 218 ± 95.4 mm for the Sigma RP-PS group), and the areas were substantially smaller than those previously reported for the normal patella. Contact points in the TKA groups stayed close to the center of the patellar components. Both designs performed satisfactorily, although patellofemoral contact areas were reduced in comparison with those in the native patella. Therapeutic Level III.

  "27932462": "Salmonella Co-opts Host Cell Chaperone -mediated Autophagy for Intracellular Growth Salmonella enterica are invasive intracellular pathogens that replicate within a membrane - bound compartment inside infected host cells known as the Salmonella - containing vacuole. How Salmonella obtains nutrients for growth within this intracellular niche despite the apparent isolation is currently not known. Recent studies have indicated the importance of glucose and related carbon sources for tissue colonization and intracellular proliferation within host cells during Salmonella infections, although none have been found to be essential. We found that wild-type Salmonella are capable of replicating within infected host cells in the absence of both exogenous sugars and/or amino acids. Furthermore, mutants defective in glucose uptake or dependent upon peptides for growth also showed no significant loss in intracellular replication, suggesting host - derived peptides can supply both carbon units and amino acids. Here, we show that intracellular Salmonella recruit the host proteins LAMP-2A and Hsc73, key components of the host protein turnover pathway known as chaperone -mediated autophagy involved in transport of cytosolic proteins to the lysosome for degradation. Host- derived peptides are shown to provide a significant contribution toward the intracellular growth of Salmonella The results reveal a means whereby intracellular Salmonella gain access to the host cell cytosol from within its membrane - bound compartment to acquire nutrients. Furthermore, this study provides an explanation as to how Salmonella evades activation of autophagy mechanisms as part of the innate immune response.",

Eighty-eight dogs diagnosed with appendicular osteosarcoma. Animals were accrued from 3 veterinary teaching hospitals. Retrospective, multi-institutional study. Dogs diagnosed with appendicular osteosarcoma and treated with limb amputation followed by a minimum of 4 doses of single-agent carboplatin were included. Data analyzed in each patient included signalment, tumor site, preoperative serum alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), and body weight (kg) at each carboplatin treatment. A slight increase in weight occurred over the course of chemotherapy, but this change was not statistically significant. Weight change did not have a significant effect on survival. Institution, patient sex, and serum ALP activity did not have a significant effect on survival. Weight change was not a prognostic factor in these dogs, and weight loss alone may not be a suitable method of determining cancer cachexia in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma.",
  "27359086": "Functional Analysis of a Bacterial Antifreeze Protein Indicates a Cooperative Effect between Its Two Ice-Binding Domains Antifreeze proteins make up a class of ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that are possessed and expressed by certain cold - adapted organisms to enhance their freezing tolerance. Here we report the biophysical and functional characterization of an IBP discovered in a bacterium recovered from a deep glacial ice core drilled at Vostok Station, Antarctica (IBPv). Our study showed that the recombinant protein rIBPv exhibited a thermal hysteresis of 2 °C at concentrations of >50 μM, effectively inhibited ice recrystallization, and enhanced bacterial viability during freeze-thaw cycling. Circular dichroism scans indicated that rIBPv mainly consists of β strands, and its denaturing temperature was 53.5 °C. Multiple-sequence alignment of homologous IBPs predicted that IBPv contains two ice-binding domains, a feature unique among known IBPs. To examine functional differences between the IBPv domains, each domain was cloned, expressed, and purified. The second domain (domain B) expressed greater ice binding activity. Data from thermal hysteresis and gel filtration assays supported the idea that the two domains cooperate to achieve a higher ice binding effect by forming heterodimers. However, physical linkage of the domains was not required for this effect.",

This study attempts to evaluate the different stages of succession in terms of composition and structure of bird populations in Hyrcanian forests. Bird - habitat relationships were investigated by comparing vegetation characteristics in three successional stages including late, initial stage, and urban areas. Bird richness, diversity, and abundance were measured within a 25-m radius of each of the 120 sampling points in various stages of succession and urban areas from May to April (2014) in the Ziarat catchment. This study indicated that every stage of succession may support certain species. Based on bird - habitat associations along the various stages of succession, two groups were distinguished. Conventional comparative analysis separated two groups of understory birds: interior specialists and edge specialists. The interior-specialist group was positively correlated with the number of dead trees, tall trees with high values of dbh and height and canopy cover. In contrast, edge specialists groups mainly included terrestrial insectivores and were positively correlated with open area and shrub cover, and percentage of shrub cover between 1 and 2 m in height. In summary, bird communities in Hyrcanian forests are highly dynamic in different vegetation covers suggesting that it is critical to increase diverse and abundant bird populations by conserving forests composed of mosaics of differently disturbed stands and mature forest patches.",

By using a murine model of S. mansoni and T. cruzi co-infection, we investigated if and to what extent these infections might interact to change the pathological outcomes typically observed when the host is infected by a single parasite species. Swiss mice were randomized into four groups: uninfected (NI) and those infected by S. mansoni (SM), T. cruzi (TC) or co-infected (SM + TC). After 120 days of S. mansoni infection, T. cruzi was concurrently inoculated and the infection occurred for 30 days. Taken together, we identified that the overlap of Th2 (schistosomiasis) and Th1 (Chagas disease) immunological patterns changes the host resistance against both pathogens. Beyond impairing the control of granulomatous inflammation, T. cruzi parasitemia and parasitism in co-infected animals, the Th2 inflammatory response against S. mansoni elicits the activation of the arginase-1 pathway to the detriment of inducible oxide nitric synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production, contributing to the liver damage, with minor effects on heart pathology.",

Pulse wave velocity (PWV) provides a measure of arterial stiffness. This study aimed to develop a technique to determine PA - PWV in horses, and secondarily to investigate a potential association between PA - PWV and arterial fibro-calcification. A dual pressure sensor catheter (PSC) was placed in the main PA of 10 sedated horses. The pressure waves were used to determine PWV along the PA, using the statistical phase offset method. Histological analysis of the PA was performed to investigate the presence of fibro-calcified lesions. The mean (±SD) PWV was 2.3±0.7m/s in the proximal PA trunk and 1.1±0.1m/s further distal (15cm) in a main PA branch. The mean (±SD) of mean arterial pressures in the proximal PA trunk was 30.1±5.2mmHg, and 22.0±6.0mmHg further distal (15cm) within the main PA branch. The mean (±SD) pulse pressure in the proximal PA trunk was 15.0±4.7mmHg, and 13.5±3.3mmHg further distal (15cm) within the main PA branch. Moderate to severe lesions of the tunica media of the PAs were observed in 7 horses, but a correlation with PWV could not be established yet. Pulmonary artery PWV may be determined in standing horses. The technique described may allow further investigation of the effect of calcification of large PAs in the pathogenesis of equine pulmonary circulatory disorders.",
  "27798174": "Are TMCs the Mechanotransduction Channels of Vertebrate Hair Cells? Sensory transduction in vertebrate hair cells and the molecules that mediate it have long been of great interest. Some components of the mechanotransduction apparatus have been identified, most as deafness gene products. Although prior candidates for the mechanotransduction channel have been proposed, each has faded with new evidence. Now, two strong candidates, TMC1 and TMC2 (transmembrane channel-like), have emerged from discovery of deafness genes in humans and mice. They are expressed at the right time during development: exactly at the onset of mechanosensitivity. They are expressed in the right place: in hair cells but not surrounding cells. Fluorescently tagged TMCs localize to the tips of stereocilia, the site of the transduction channels. TMCs bind other proteins essential for mechanosensation, suggesting a larger transduction complex. Although TMC1 and TMC2 can substitute for each other, genetic deletion of both renders mouse hair cells mechanically insensitive. Finally, the conductance and Ca(2+) selectivity of the transduction channels depend on the TMC proteins, differing when hair cells express one or the other TMC, and differing if TMC1 harbors a point mutation. Some contrary evidence has emerged: a current activated in hair cells by negative pressure, with some similarity to the transduction current, persists in TMC knock-outs. But it is not clear that this anomalous current is carried by the same proteins. Further evidence is desired, such as production of a mechanically gated conductance by pure TMCs. But the great majority of evidence is consistent with these TMCs as pore-forming subunits of the long-sought hair-cell transduction channel.",
  "27445856": "High-Intensity Intermittent Training Positively Affects Aerobic and Anaerobic Performance in Judo Athletes Independently of Exercise Mode The present study investigated the effects of high-intensity intermittent training (HIIT) on lower - and upper-body graded exercise and high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE, four Wingate bouts) performance, and on physiological and muscle damage markers responses in judo athletes. Thirty-five subjects were randomly allocated to a control group (n = 8) or to one of the following HIIT groups (n = 9 for each) and tested pre- and post -four weeks (2 training d·wk(-1)): (1) lower-body cycle-ergometer; (2) upper-body cycle-ergometer; (3) uchi-komi (judo technique entrance). All HIIT were constituted by two blocks of 10 sets of 20 s of all out effort interspersed by 10 s set intervals and 5-min between blocks. For the upper-body group there was an increase in maximal aerobic power in graded upper-body exercise test (12.3%). The lower-body group increased power at onset blood lactate in graded upper-body exercise test (22.1%). The uchi-komi group increased peak power in upper - (16.7%) and lower-body (8.5%), while the lower-body group increased lower-body mean power (14.2%) during the HIIE. There was a decrease in the delta blood lactate for the uchi-komi training group and in the third and fourth bouts for the upper-body training group. Training induced testosterone-cortisol ratio increased in the lower-body HIIE for the lower-body (14.9%) and uchi-komi (61.4%) training groups. Thus, short-duration low-volume HIIT added to regular judo training was able to increase upper-body aerobic power, lower - and upper-body HIIE performance.",
  "27905972": "A new parametric model to assess delay and compression of mortality A decrease in mortality across all ages causes a shift of the age pattern of mortality, or mortality delay, while differences in the rate of decrease across ages cause a change in the shape of the age-at-death distribution, mortality compression or expansion. Evidence exists for both compression and delay of mortality. Existing parametric models to describe the full age pattern of mortality are not able to capture mortality delay versus mortality compression. More recent models that assess delay versus compression mostly focused on the adult or old ages alone and did not distinguish mortality compression below and above the modal age at death, although they represent different mechanisms. This paper presents a new parametric model that describes the full age pattern of mortality and assesses compression - at different stages of life - and delay of mortality: the CoDe model. The model includes 10 parameters, of which five are constant over time. The five time -varying parameters reflect delay of mortality and compression of mortality in infancy, adolescence, young adulthood, late adulthood, and old age. The model describes infant and background mortality by two simple functions, uses a mixed logistic model with different slopes in adult, middle, and old age, and includes the modal age at death as a parameter to account for the delay in mortality. Applying the CoDe model to age - specific probabilities of death for Japanese, French, American, and Danish men and women between 1950 and 2010 showed a very good fit of the full age pattern of mortality. Delay of mortality explained about two-thirds of the increase in life expectancy at birth, whereas compression of mortality due to mortality declines in young age explained about one-third. No strong compression of mortality in late adulthood age was observed. Mortality compression in old age has had a small negative impact on life expectancy. The CoDe model proved a valid instrument for describing the full age pattern of mortality and for disentangling the effects of mortality delay and compression - at different stages of life - on the increase in life expectancy.",
  "28063101": "Elimination and molecular identification of endophytic bacterial contaminants during in vitro propagation of Bambusa balcooa Bambusa balcooa is an economically important, multipurpose bamboo species, decidedly used in construction industry. Availability of natural bamboo is depleting very rapidly due to accelerated deforestation and its unrestrained use. The large number and timely supply of saplings are the need of the hour for the restoration of bamboo stands. Micropropagation, being the potent alternative for season independent rapid regeneration, is restricted in bamboo because of endophytic contamination. An in vitro attempt has been taken to overcome the endophytic contamination by using broad spectrum antibiotics as surface sterilant as well as a media component. Ampicillin sodium salt (5 mg/ml for 30 min) as a surface sterilant was found as the best treatment for high bud breaking (80%) coupled with high branching and low contamination (20%) but it was found ineffective to control the contamination during multiplication stage. Then, two endophytes were isolated and minimum inhibitory concentration was determined through antibiotic susceptibility test for successful eradication at multiplication stage. Finally, contamination free cultures were obtained when streptocycline (100 μg/ml) and gentamicin sulphate (75 μg/ml) were added into the medium. The two isolated endophytes, BB1 and BB2, were identified through 16S rDNA techniques and NCBI-BLAST algorithm with 99% sequence similarity with those of Janibacter sp. (KX423734) and Serratia marcescens strain (KX423735). To our knowledge, this is the first report for B. balcooa where antibiotics were used as surface sterilant as well as medium component, to control endophytic bacterial contaminants, followed by their identification.",
  "27914987": "Tetrabromobisphenol A activates the hepatic interferon pathway in rats Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a widely used flame retardant in printed circuit boards, paper, and textiles. In a two-year study, TBBPA showed evidence of uterine tumors in female Wistar-Han rats and liver and colon tumors in B6C3F1 mice. In order to gain further insight into early gene and pathway changes leading to cancer, we exposed female Wistar Han rats to TBBPA at 0, 25, 250, or 1000mg/kg (oral gavage in corn oil, 5×/ week) for 13 weeks. Because at the end of the TBBPA exposure period, there were no treatment-related effects on body weights, liver or uterus lesions, and liver and uterine organ weights were within 10% of controls, only the high dose animals were analyzed. Analysis of the hepatic and uterine transcriptomes showed TBBPA -induced changes primarily in the liver (1000mg/kg), with 159 transcripts corresponding to 132 genes differentially expressed compared to controls (FDR=0.05). Pathway analysis showed activation of interferon (IFN) and metabolic networks. TBBPA induced few molecular changes in the uterus. Activation of the interferon pathway in the liver occurred after 13-weeks of TBBPA exposure, and with longer term TBBPA exposure this may lead to immunomodulatory changes that contribute to carcinogenic processes.",

The purpose of this study is to extend our knowledge of HBM by investigating the role of maternal body mass index (BMI), sex and stage of lactation (month 1 vs. 6) on HBM insulin, glucose, leptin, IL-6 and TNF-α and their associations with infant body composition. Thirty-seven exclusively breastfeeding infants (n = 37; 16♀, 21♂), and their mothers (19-47 kg m(-2)) were studied at 1 and 6 months of lactation. Infants had body composition measured (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and HBM collected. A significant interaction between maternal BMI and infant sex on insulin levels (p = 0.0322) was observed such that insulin was 229% higher in obese mothers nursing female infants than in normal weight mothers nursing female infants and 179% higher than obese mothers nursing male infants. For leptin, a significant association with BMI category was observed (p < 0.0001) such that overweight and obese mothers had 96.5% and 315.1% higher leptin levels than normal weight mothers, respectively. Leptin was also found to have a significant (p = 0.0004) 33.7% decrease from months 1 to 6, controlling for BMI category and sex. A significant inverse relationship between month 1 leptin levels and infant length (p = 0.0257), percent fat (p = 0.0223), total fat mass (p = 0.0226) and trunk fat mass (p = 0.0111) at month 6 was also found. No associations or interactions were observed for glucose, TNF-α or IL-6. These data demonstrate that maternal BMI, infant sex and stage of lactation affect the compositional make-up of insulin and leptin.",
  "28527513": "Enzymatic biosynthesis of novel neobavaisoflavone glucosides via Bacillus UDP - glycosyltransferase The present study was designed to perform structural modifications of of neobavaisoflavone (NBIF), using an in vitro enzymatic glycosylation reaction, in order to improve its water-solubility. Two novel glucosides of NBIF were obtained from an enzymatic glycosylation by UDP - glycosyltransferase. The glycosylated products were elucidated by LC-MS, HR-ESI-MS, and NMR analysis. The HPLC peaks were integrated and the concentrations in sample solutions were calculated. The MTT assay was used to detect the cytotoxic activity of compounds in cancer cell lines. Based on the spectroscopic analyses, the two novel glucosides were identified as neobavaisoflavone-4'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1) and neobavaisoflavone-4', 7-di-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (2). Additionally, the water-solubilities of compounds 1 and 2 were approximately 175.1- and 4 031.9-fold higher than that of the substrate, respectively. Among the test compounds, only NBIF exhibited weak cytotoxicity against four human cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 63.47 to 72.81 µmol·L(-1). These results suggest that in vitro enzymatic glycosylation is a powerful approach to structural modification, improving water-solubility.",
  "28459124": "Museum specimen data reveal emergence of a plant disease may be linked to increases in the insect vector population The emergence rate of new plant diseases is increasing due to novel introductions, climate change, and changes in vector populations, posing risks to agricultural sustainability. Assessing and managing future disease risks depends on understanding the causes of contemporary and historical emergence events. Since the mid-1990s, potato growers in the western United States, Mexico, and Central America have experienced severe yield loss from Zebra Chip disease and have responded by increasing insecticide use to suppress populations of the insect vector, the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Hemiptera: Triozidae). Despite the severe nature of Zebra Chip outbreaks, the causes of emergence remain unknown. We tested the hypotheses that 1) B. cockerelli occupancy has increased over the last century in California and 2) such increases are related to climate change, specifically warmer winters. We compiled a dataset of 87,000 museum specimen occurrence records across the order Hemiptera collected between 1900 and 2014. We then analyzed changes in B. cockerelli distribution using a hierarchical occupancy model using changes in background species lists to correct for collecting effort. We found evidence that B. cockerelli occupancy has increased over the last century. However, these changes appear to be unrelated to climate changes, at least at the scale of our analysis. To the extent that species occupancy is related to abundance, our analysis provides the first quantitative support for the hypothesis that B. cockerelli population abundance has increased, but further work is needed to link B. cockerelli population dynamics to Zebra Chip epidemics. Finally, we demonstrate how this historical macro-ecological approach provides a general framework for comparative risk assessment of future pest and insect vector outbreaks.

  "28019021": "Multiparametric estimation of brain hemodynamics with MR fingerprinting ASL Assessment of brain hemodynamics without exogenous contrast agents is of increasing importance in clinical applications. This study aims to develop an MR perfusion technique that can provide noncontrast and multiparametric estimation of hemodynamic markers. We devised an arterial spin labeling (ASL) method based on the principle of MR fingerprinting (MRF), referred to as MRF-ASL. By taking advantage of the rich information contained in MRF sequence, up to seven hemodynamic parameters can be estimated concomitantly. Feasibility demonstration, flip angle optimization, comparison with Look-Locker ASL, reproducibility test, sensitivity to hypercapnia challenge, and initial clinical application in an intracranial steno-occlusive process, Moyamoya disease, were performed to evaluate this technique. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting ASL provided estimation of up to seven parameters, including B1+, tissue T1, cerebral blood flow (CBF), tissue bolus arrival time (BAT), pass-through arterial BAT, pass-through blood volume, and pass-through blood travel time. Coefficients of variation of the estimated parameters ranged from 0.2 to 9.6%. Hypercapnia resulted in an increase in CBF by 57.7%, and a decrease in BAT by 13.7 and 24.8% in tissue and vessels, respectively. Patients with Moyamoya disease showed diminished CBF and lengthened BAT that could not be detected with regular ASL. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting ASL is a promising technique for noncontrast, multiparametric perfusion assessment.

Samples from rind and heart of Maroilles cheese were used, the LAB were selected on MRS agar at 30°C and 197 Gram-positive and catalase-negative strains were subjected to identification by MALDI-TOF MS profiling. All strains were unambiguously identified: 105 strains from Maroilles made with raw milk (38 on the rind and 67 in the heart) and 92 strains from Maroilles made with pasteurized milk (39 on the rind and 53 in the heart). MALDI-TOF MS identification allowed identification of three genera belonging to LAB including Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Leuconostoc. Lactobacillus was the most represented genus with seven species: Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), L. paracasei, L. curvatus, L. rhamnosus, L. fructivorans, L. parabuchneri, L. brevis found in Maroilles made with both kind of milk. The correlation between the 16S rDNA -based identification performed on selected strains and those obtained by MALDI-TOF-MS demonstrates that this fast, economically affordable, robust and reliable method for bacteria characterisation stands as an attractive alternative to the commonly-used methods and its application in food industry is discussed.",

Successful crosslinking of the bioactive molecules to the chitosan nanoparticles was confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The colloidal characteristics of the synthesized nanoparticles were revealed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. Morphological analysis by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed that the bioactive molecule -loaded CNPs were well-dispersed and spherical or polygonal in shape with an average size of<73.27nm than the z-average value (327nm) as measured by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). SRLE CNP - treated diabetic rats showed a significant reduction in their mean fasting blood glucose level compared with the diabetic control group.

  "27861593": "Neutrophil and Monocyte Function in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Undergoing Antiviral Therapy with Regimens Containing Protease Inhibitors with and without Interferon Real-life data showed an increased incidence of bacterial infections in patients with advanced liver disease receiving a protease inhibitor (PI)-containing antiviral regimen against hepatitis C (HCV). However, the causes of this event are unknown. We hypothesized that PIs might impair innate immune responses through the inhibition of proteases participating in the anti-bacterial functions of neutrophils and monocytes. The aims of the study were to assess phagocytic and oxidative burst capacity in neutrophils and monocytes obtained from patients receiving a PI containing- antiviral regimen, and to determine cytokine secretion after neutrophil stimulation with flagellin. Forty patients with chronic HCV (80% with cirrhosis) were enrolled in the study, 28 received triple therapy (Group A) with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin for 4 weeks followed by the addition of a PI (telaprevir, boceprevir or simeprevir), and 12 patients received an interferon -free regimen (Group B) with simeprevir and sofosbuvir. Phagocytosis and oxidative burst capacity were analyzed by flow cytometry at baseline, week 4, and week 8 of therapy. In neutrophils from Group A patients, oxidative burst rate and oxidative enzymatic activity per cell significantly decreased throughout the study period (p = 0.014 and p = 0.010, respectively). Pairwise comparisons showed a decrease between baseline and week 4 and 8 of therapy. No differences were observed after the introduction of the PI. The oxidative enzymatic activity per cell in monocytes significantly decrease during the study period (p = 0.042) due to a decrease from baseline to week 8 of therapy (p = 0.037) in patients from Group A. None of these findings were observed in Group B patients. Cytokine secretion did not significantly change during the study in both groups. In conclusion, our data suggest that the use interferon (rather than the PI) has a deleterious effect on neutrophil and monocyte phagocytic and oxidative burst capacity in this cohort of patients with HCV -related advanced liver fibrosis.",

There are limited data about the prevalence of TB patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) in Sudan. The aim of this study is to identify the prevalence and presentation of TB among Sudanese maintenance HD patients. This is a hospital -based descriptive study. The participants of the study are all HD patients distributed in 13 HD centers in Khartoum and Khartoum North Provinces in Sudan. All patients attended the HD centers from November 1, 2014 to February 1, 2015, were interviewed by a questionnaire focused on personal and clinical data. Those who were diagnosed as having active TB were studied regarding their clinical presentation, presence of comorbidities, site of TB, and methods used on diagnosis. The total number of HD patients during the study period was 1328 patients. We found 19 patients who already diagnosed and treated for TB infection. The prevalence rate of TB among HD patients is 1.4%. The mean age of patient was 44.53±8.69 years, 89.5% of them were males. The majority of them have comorbidities: 31.6%% have hypertension and 21.1% have diabetes. Extrapulmonary TB was the major presentation (57.9%) mainly tuberculous lymphadenitis (26.3%). The pulmonary presentation was found to be 42.1%. The diagnosis of TB was supported by microbiological evidence of alcohol acid-fast Bacilli present in sputum smear (21%), histological diagnosis (31.6%), polymerase chain reaction (21%), and imaging in (26.3%).

  "28051899": "Serious Games for Health: The Potential of Metadata Numerous serious games and health games exist, either as commercial products (typically with a focus on entertaining a broad user group) or smaller games and game prototypes, often resulting from research projects (typically tailored to a smaller user group with a specific health characteristic). A major drawback of existing health games is that they are not very well described and attributed with (machine -readable, quantitative, and qualitative) metadata such as the characterizing goal of the game, the target user group, or expected health effects well proven in scientific studies. This makes it difficult or even impossible for end users to find and select the most appropriate game for a specific situation (e.g., health needs). Therefore, the aim of this article was to motivate the need and potential / benefit of metadata for the description and retrieval of health games and to describe a descriptive model for the qualitative description of games for health. It was not the aim of the article to describe a stable, running system (portal) for health games. This will be addressed in future work. Building on previous work toward a metadata format for serious games, a descriptive model for the formal description of games for health is introduced. For the conceptualization of this model, classification schemata of different existing health game repositories are considered. The classification schema consists of three levels: a core set of mandatory descriptive fields relevant for all games for health application areas, a detailed level with more comprehensive, optional information about the games, and so-called extension as level three with specific descriptive elements relevant for dedicated health games application areas, for example, cardio training. A metadata format provides a technical framework to describe, find, and select appropriate health games matching the needs of the end user. Future steps to improve, apply, and promote the metadata format in the health games market are discussed.",
  "28442243": "Abnormal neural precursor cell regulation in the early postnatal Fragile X mouse hippocampus The regulation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) is indispensable for a properly functioning brain. Abnormalities in NPC proliferation, differentiation, survival, or integration have been linked to various neurological diseases including Fragile X syndrome. Yet, no studies have examined NPCs from the early postnatal Fragile X mouse hippocampus despite the importance of this developmental time point, which marks the highest expression level of FMRP, the protein missing in Fragile X, in the rodent hippocampus and is when hippocampal NPCs have migrated to the dentate gyrus (DG) to give rise to lifelong neurogenesis. In this study, we examined NPCs from the early postnatal hippocampus and DG of Fragile X mice (Fmr1 - KO). Immunocytochemistry on neurospheres showed increased Nestin expression and decreased Ki67 expression, which collectively indicated aberrant NPC biology. Intriguingly, flow cytometric analysis of the expression of the antigens CD15, CD24, CD133, GLAST, and PSA-NCAM showed a decreased proportion of neural stem cells (GLAST(+)CD15(+)CD133(+)) and an increased proportion of neuroblasts (PSA-NCAM(+)CD15(+)) in the DG of P7 Fmr1 - KO mice. This was mirrored by lower expression levels of Nestin and the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 in vivo in the P9 hippocampus, as well as a decreased proportion of cells in the G2/M phases of the P7 DG. Thus, the absence of FMRP leads to fewer actively cycling NPCs, coinciding with a decrease in neural stem cells and an increase in neuroblasts. Together, these results show the importance of FMRP in the developing hippocampal formation and suggest abnormalities in cell cycle regulation in Fragile X.",

In order to counteract these problems, effect of ascorbic acid on cell growth and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) production was investigated in Schizochytrium sp. Addition of 9g/L ascorbic acid resulted in 16.16% and 30.44% improvement in cell dry weight (CDW) and DHA yield, respectively. Moreover, the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) of cells decreased from 2.17 at 12h to 0 at 60h and did not recover, while ascorbic acid addition could extend the time of arrival zero with the reduced intracellular ROS. However, ROS levels still increased after 72h. Therefore, to further solve the problem of high ROS levels and low T-AOC of cells after 72h, a two-point addition strategy was proposed. With this strategy, DHA yield was further increased to 38.26g/L. This work innovatively investigated the feasibility of manipulating Schizochytrium sp. cultivation through ROS level and T-AOC.",

We also aimed to examine longitudinal measurement invariance and identify factors-such as age, gender, educational level, treatment and psychopathological change scores -potentially linked to cognitive change among patients. In addition, correlations between objectively measured and subjectively evaluated cognitive functioning were estimated. Neuropsychological assessments were administered to 85 patients after the initial stabilisation of their psychosis; 82 of the patients were retested. Subjectively perceived cognitive functioning was measured using a subscale derived from the Estonian version of the Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptic Scale (SWN-K-E). On average, executive functioning and processing speed improved significantly, while memory test scores decreased significantly, over time. Very high rank-order stability (r=0.80 to 0.94, p<0.001) was observed with all measured ability scores. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed the loadings of a single (broad ability) factor model were equal across both measurement occasions, but the lack of intercept invariance suggested that mean -level comparisons are more appropriately carried out at a subtest level. On average psychopathology scores and antipsychotics doses declined over time, with the latter also significantly correlating with better executive functioning. Gender was a significant moderator of some domains of cognitive performance, and decline tended to be somewhat more pronounced for women. The results also indicated the lack of any relationship between objective and subjective measurements of cognitive functioning.",
  "28202494": "Fumarate hydratase is a critical metabolic regulator of hematopoietic stem cell functions Strict regulation of stem cell metabolism is essential for tissue functions and tumor suppression. In this study, we investigated the role of fumarate hydratase (Fh1), a key component of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and cytosolic fumarate metabolism, in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. Hematopoiesis - specific Fh1 deletion (resulting in endogenous fumarate accumulation and a genetic TCA cycle block reflected by decreased maximal mitochondrial respiration) caused lethal fetal liver hematopoietic defects and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) failure. Reexpression of extramitochondrial Fh1 (which normalized fumarate levels but not maximal mitochondrial respiration) rescued these phenotypes, indicating the causal role of cellular fumarate accumulation. However, HSCs lacking mitochondrial Fh1 (which had normal fumarate levels but defective maximal mitochondrial respiration) failed to self-renew and displayed lymphoid differentiation defects. In contrast, leukemia -initiating cells lacking mitochondrial Fh1 efficiently propagated Meis1 / Hoxa9 -driven leukemia. Thus, we identify novel roles for fumarate metabolism in HSC maintenance and hematopoietic differentiation and reveal a differential requirement for mitochondrial Fh1 in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia propagation.",

Viability and yield were defined as fresh hepatocytes and their spheroids formation after 24-hour rocker culture in serum-free medium. Metabolic function was assessed by gene expression, albumin, and urea synthesis. All procedures resulted in successful hepatocyte isolation. Cells from the NB 8 + NAC group had (97.8±1.9)% viability, which was higher than the NB 8 group with (94.4±2.4)% and the NB 4 group with (94.5±3.2)% (P<.001). The final cell yield reached (11.8±1.0)×10(9) cells in the NB 8 + NAC group, compared to (9.5±2.1)×10(9) cells in the NB 8 group (P<.01) and (9.1±1.1) ×10(9) cells in the NB 4 group (P<.001). The secretion of albumin was superior in the NB 8 + NAC group at a concentration of (425.8±35.3) ng/mL compared to the NB 8 group (339.1±32.6) ng/mL (P <.001) and NB 4 group (293.6±43.3) ng/mL (P <.01). The injury of hepatocytes also decreased in the NB 8 + NAC group (P<.01). The data are presented as means ± SD. Formulated collagenase Serva NB 8 and NAC could improve the porcine hepatocyte isolation, resulting in higher yields of viable cells.",
  "27832198": "Evolution of Fitness Cost-Neutral Mutant PfCRT Conferring P. falciparum 4-Aminoquinoline Drug Resistance Is Accompanied by Altered Parasite Metabolism and Digestive Vacuole Physiology Southeast Asia is an epicenter of multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Selective pressures on the subcontinent have recurrently produced several allelic variants of parasite drug resistance genes, including the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt). Despite significant reductions in the deployment of the 4-aminoquinoline drug chloroquine (CQ), which selected for the mutant pfcrt alleles that halted CQ efficacy decades ago, the parasite pfcrt locus is continuously evolving. This is highlighted by the presence of a highly mutated allele, Cam734 pfcrt, which has acquired the singular ability to confer parasite CQ resistance without an associated fitness cost. Here, we used pfcrt -specific zinc-finger nucleases to genetically dissect this allele in the pathogenic setting of asexual blood-stage infection. Comparative analysis of drug resistance and growth profiles of recombinant parasites that express Cam734 or variants thereof, Dd2 (the most common Southeast Asian variant), or wild-type pfcrt, revealed previously unknown roles for PfCRT mutations in modulating parasite susceptibility to multiple antimalarial agents. These results were generated in the GC03 strain, used in multiple earlier pfcrt studies, and might differ in natural isolates harboring this allele. Results presented herein show that Cam734 -mediated CQ resistance is dependent on the rare A144F mutation that has not been observed beyond Southeast Asia, and reveal distinct impacts of this and other Cam734 -specific mutations on CQ resistance and parasite growth rates. Biochemical assays revealed a broad impact of mutant PfCRT isoforms on parasite metabolism, including nucleoside triphosphate levels, hemoglobin catabolism and disposition of heme, as well as digestive vacuole volume and pH. Results from our study provide new insights into the complex molecular basis and physiological impact of PfCRT -mediated antimalarial drug resistance, and inform ongoing efforts to characterize novel pfcrt alleles that can undermine the efficacy of first-line antimalarial drug regimens.",
  "27618157": "Immobilization of Lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens on Porous Polyurea and Its Application in Kinetic Resolution of Racemic 1-Phenylethanol A porous polyurea (PPU) was prepared through a simple protocol by reacting toluene diisocyanate with water in binary solvent of water - acetone. Its amine group was determined through spectrophotometric absorbance based on its iminization with p-nitrobenzaldehyde amines. PPU was then used as a novel polymer support for enzyme immobilization, through activation by glutaraldehyde followed by immobilization of an enzyme, lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFL), via covalent bonding with the amine groups of lipase molecules. Influences of glutaraldehyde and enzyme concentration and pH in the process were studied. The results revealed that the activity of the immobilized PFL reached a maximum at GA concentration of 0.17 mol/L and at pH 8. Immobilization rate of 60% or higher for PFL was obtained under optimized condition with an enzyme activity of 283 U/mg. The porous structure of PPU, prior to and after GA activation and PFL immobilization, was characterized. The activity of the immobilized PFL at different temperature and pH and its stability at 40 °C as well as its reusability were tested. The immobilized enzyme was finally used as enantioselective catalyst in kinetic resolution of racemic 1- ph enylethanol (1-PEOH), and its performance compared with the free PFL. The results demonstrate that the enzyme activity and stability were greatly improved for the immobilized PFL, and highly pure enantiomers from racemic 1-PEOH were effectively achieved using the immobilized PFL. Noticeable deactivation of PFL in the resolution was observed by acetaldehyde in situ formed. In addition, the immobilized PFL was readily recovered from the reaction system for reuse. A total of 73% of the initial activity was retained after 5 repeated reuse cycles. This work provides a novel route to preparation of a polyurea porous material and its enzyme immobilization, leading to a novel type of immobilized enzyme for efficient kinetic resolution of racemic molecules.",
  "27617011": "An Improved Culture Method for Selective Isolation of Campylobacter jejuni from Wastewater Campylobacter jejuni is one of the leading foodborne pathogens worldwide. C. jejuni is isolated from a wide range of foods, domestic animals, wildlife, and environmental sources. The currently available culture-based isolation methods are not highly effective for wastewater samples due to the low number of C. jejuni in the midst of competing bacteria. To detect and isolate C. jejuni from wastewater samples, in this study, we evaluated a few different enrichment conditions using five different antibiotics (i.e., cefoperazone, vancomycin, trimethoprim, polymyxin B, and rifampicin), to which C. jejuni is intrinsically resistant. The selectivity of each enrichment condition was measured with C t value using quantitative real-time PCR, and multiplex PCR to determine Campylobacter species. In addition, the efficacy of Campylobacter isolation on different culture media after selective enrichment was examined by growing on Bolton and Preston agar plates. The addition of polymyxin B, rifampicin, or both to the Bolton selective supplements enhanced the selective isolation of C. jejuni. The results of 16S rDNA sequencing also revealed that Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are major competing bacteria in the enrichment conditions. Although it is known to be difficult to isolate Campylobacter from samples with heavy contamination, this study well exhibited that the manipulation of antibiotic selective pressure improves the isolation efficiency of fastidious Campylobacter from wastewater.",

Results show that micro-algae are neither competitive yet with traditional oil crops nor with fossil fuel. The use of renewable technologies as photovoltaics and biogas self production might increase the competitiveness of micro-algae oil.

  "28271030": "High-fidelity Glucagon-CreER mouse line generated by CRISPR-Cas9 assisted gene targeting α-cells are the second most prominent cell type in pancreatic islets and are responsible for producing glucagon to increase plasma glucose levels in times of fasting. α-cell dysfunction and inappropriate glucagon secretion occur in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Thus, there is growing interest in studying both normal function and pathophysiology of α-cells. However, tools to target gene ablation or activation specifically of α-cells have been limited, compared to those available for β-cells. Previous Glucagon-Cre and Glucagon-CreER transgenic mouse lines have suffered from transgene silencing, and the only available Glucagon-CreER \"knock-in\" mouse line results in glucagon haploinsufficiency, which can confound the interpretation of gene deletion analyses. Therefore, we sought to develop a Glucagon-CreER(T2) mouse line that would maintain normal glucagon expression and would be less susceptible to transgene silencing. We utilized CRISPR-Cas9 technology to insert an IRES-CreER(T2) sequence into the 3' UTR of the Glucagon (Gcg) locus in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Targeted ESC clones were then injected into mouse blastocysts to obtain Gcg-CreER(T2) mice. Recombination efficiency in GCG (+) pancreatic α-cells and glucagon-like peptide 1 positive (GLP1(+)) enteroendocrine L-cells was measured in Gcg-CreER(T2); Rosa26-LSL-YFP mice injected with tamoxifen during fetal development and adulthood. Tamoxifen injection of Gcg-CreER(T2); Rosa26-LSL-YFP mice induced high recombination efficiency of the Rosa26-LSL-YFP locus in perinatal and adult α-cells (88% and 95%, respectively), as well as in first-wave fetal α-cells (36%) and adult enteroendocrine L-cells (33%). Mice homozygous for the Gcg-CreER(T2) allele were phenotypically normal. We successfully derived a Gcg-CreER(T2) mouse line that expresses CreER(T2) in pancreatic α-cells and enteroendocrine L-cells without disrupting preproglucagon gene expression. These mice will be a useful tool for performing temporally controlled genetic manipulation specifically in these cell types.",
  "27626099": "Peptide -Mediated Interference of PB2 - eIF4G1 Interaction Inhibits Influenza A Viruses ' Replication in Vitro and in Vivo Influenza viruses are obligate parasites that hijack the host cellular system. Previous results have shown that the influenza virus PB2 subunit confers a dependence of host eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-γ 1 (eIF4G1) for viral mRNA translation. Here, we demonstrated that peptide -mediated interference of the PB2 - eIF4G1 interaction inhibited virus replication in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, intranasal administration of the peptide provided 100% protection against lethal challenges of influenza A viruses in BALB/c mice, including H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 influenza virus subtypes. Mapping of the PB2 protein indicated that the eIF4G1 binding sites resided within the PB2 cap - binding domain. Virtual docking analysis suggested that the inhibitory peptide associated with the conserved amino acid residues that were essential to PB2 cap-binding activity. Overall, our results identified the PB2 - eIF4G1 interactive site as a druggable target for influenza therapeutics.",

  "28122243": "Opposing Roles of Acetylation and Phosphorylation in LIFR - Dependent Self-Renewal Growth Signaling in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells LIF promotes self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and in its absence, the cells differentiate. LIF binds to the LIF receptor (LIFR) and activates the JAK-STAT3 pathway, but it remains unknown how the receptor complex triggers differentiation or self-renewal. Here, we report that the LIFR cytoplasmic domain contains a self-renewal domain within the juxtamembrane region and a differentiation domain within the C-terminal region. The differentiation domain contains four SPXX repeats that are phosphorylated by MAPK to restrict STAT3 activation; the self-renewal domain is characterized by a 3K motif that is acetylated by p300. In mESCs, acetyl- LIFR undergoes homodimerization, leading to STAT3 hypo- or hyper-activation depending on the presence or absence of gp130. LIFR - activated STAT3 restricts differentiation via cytokine induction. Thus, LIFR acetylation and serine phosphorylation differentially promote stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.",
  "28389629": "Inhibition of p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) activity by A77 1726, the active metabolite of leflunomide, induces autophagy through TAK1 -mediated AMPK and JNK activation mTOR activation suppresses autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 at S757 and suppressing its enzymatic activity. Here we report that feedback activation of mTOR in the PI-3 kinase pathway by two p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) inhibitors (PF-4708671 and A77 1726, the active metabolite of an immunosuppressive drug leflunomide) or by S6K1 knockdown did not suppress but rather induced autophagy. Suppression of S6K1 activity led to the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK, which then phosphorylated ULK1 at S555. While mTOR feedback activation led to increased phosphorylation of ULK1 at S757, this modification did not the disrupt ULK1 - AMPK interaction nor dampen ULK1 S555 phosphorylation and the induction of autophagy. In addition, inhibition of S6K1 activity led to JNK activation, which also contributed to autophagy. 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, a specific inhibitor of TAK1, or TAK1 siRNA blocked A77 1726 -induced activation of AMPK and JNK, and LC3 lipidation. Taken together, our study establishes S6K1 as a key player in the PI-3 kinase pathway to suppress autophagy through inhibiting AMPK and JNK in a TAK1 -dependent manner.",
  "27745564": "How should proxies of cognitive reserve be evaluated in a population of healthy older adults? While some tools have been developed to estimate an individual's cognitive reserve (CR), no study has assessed the adequacy of the method used for assessing these CR proxy indicators. Therefore, we aimed to determine the most appropriate method to estimate CR by comparing two approaches: (1) the common assessment of CR proxies in the literature (e.g. years of education) and (2) the calculation of a comprehensive index based on most significant parameters used in the estimation of CR. Data on CR proxies (i.e. education, occupation, and leisure activities) were obtained in a sample of 204 older adults. Regression analyses were used to develop the two indices of CR (i.e. ICR-standard and ICR-detailed) and to determine which index best represented the level of one's CR. The ICR-standard was calculated using a combination of the three most common measures of reserve in the literature: number of schooling years, complexity of the primary occupation, and amount of current participation in stimulating activities. The ICR-detailed was calculated using the most significant parameters (established in initial analyses) of CR: highest level of education combined with the number of training courses, last occupation, and amount of current participation in social and intellectual activities. The comparison of both indices showed that higher levels of ICR-standard and ICR-detailed were associated with a greater minimization of the effects of age on cognition. However, the ICR-detailed was more strongly associated to this minimization than the ICR-standard, suggesting that the ICR-detailed best reflect one's CR. This study is the first to show that it is of great importance to question methods measuring CR proxies in order to develop a clinical tool allowing a comprehensive and accurate estimation of CR.",
  "28262340": "Gain-of-function mutation in SCN5A causes ventricular arrhythmias and early onset atrial fibrillation Mutations in SCN5A, the gene encoding the α-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel (NaV1.5), are associated with a broad spectrum of inherited cardiac arrhythmia disorders. The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic and functional determinants underlying a Dutch family that presented with a combined phenotype of ventricular arrhythmias with a likely adrenergic component, either in isolation or in combination with a mildly decreased heart function and early onset (<55 years) atrial fibrillation. We performed next generation sequencing in the proband of a two- generation Dutch family and demonstrated a novel missense mutation in SCN5A-(p.M1851V) which co-segregated with the clinical phenotype in the family. We functionally evaluated the putative genetic defect by patch clamp electrophysiological studies in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with mutant or wild-type Nav1.5. The current inactivation was slower and recovery from inactivation was faster in SCN5A-M1851V channels. The voltage dependence of inactivation was shifted towards more positive potentials and consequently, a larger TTX - sensitive window current was observed in SCN5A-M1851V channels. Furthermore, a higher upstroke velocity was observed for the SCN5A-M1851V channels, while the depolarization voltage was more negative, both indicating increased excitability. This mutation leads to a gain-of-function mechanism based on increased channel availability and increased window current, fitting the observed clinical phenotype of (likely adrenergic-induced) ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. These findings further expand the range of cardiac arrhythmias associated with mutations in SCN5A.",
  "27444328": "Extra carbohydrate binding module contributes to the processivity and catalytic activity of a non-modular hydrolase family 5 endoglucanase from Fomitiporia mediterranea MF3/22 FmEG from Fomitiporia mediterranea is a non-modular endoglucanase composed of a 24-amino acids extension and 13-amino acids linker-like peptide at the N-terminus and a 312-amino acids GH5 catalytic domain (CD) at the C-terminus. In this study, six FmEG derivatives with deletion of N-terminal fragments or fusion with an extra family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM1) was constructed in order to evaluate the contribution of CBM1 to FmEG processivity and catalytic activity. FmEG showed a weak processivity and released cellobiose (G2) and cellotriose (G3) as main end products, and cellotriose (G4) as minor end product from filter paper (FP), but more amount of G4 was released from regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC). All derivatives had similar activity on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with the same optimal pH (7.0) and temperature (50°C). However, fusing an extra CBM1 to FmEG△24 or FmEG△37 with flexible peptide significantly improved its processivity and catalytic activity to FP and RAC. Overall, 1.79- and 1.84-fold increases in the soluble /insoluble product ratio on FP, and 1.38- and 1.39-fold increases on RAC, compared to FmEG△24, were recorded for CBM1 - FmEG△24 and CBM1 -linker- FmEG△24, respectively. Meanwhile, they displayed 2.64- and 2.67-fold more activity on RAC, and 1.68- and 1.77-fold on FP, respectively. Similar improvement was also obtained for CBM1 -linker- FmEG△37 as compared with FmEG△37. Interestingly, fusion of an extra CBM1 with FmEG also caused an alteration of cleavage pattern on insoluble celluloses. Our results suggest that such improvements in processivity and catalytic activity may arise from CBM1 binding affinity. The N-terminal 24- or 37-amino acids may serve as linker for sufficient spatial separation of the two domains required for processivity and catalytic activity. In addition, deletion of the N-terminal 24- or 37-amino acids led to significant reduction in thermostability but not the enzymatic activity.",

We used the search term \" gambling \" to identify articles that were published in behaviorally oriented journals between the years 1992 and 2012 and categorized the content of each article as empirical or conceptual. Next, we examined and categorized the empirical articles by inclusion of an experimental manipulation and treatment to alleviate at least some aspect of pathological gambling, participant population used, type of gambling task employed in the research, whether the participants in the study actually gambled, and the behavioral phenomena of interest. The results show that the rate of publication of gambling research has increased in the last 6 years, and a vast majority of articles are empirical. Of the empirical articles, examinations of treatment techniques or methods are scarce; slot machine play is the most represented form of gambling, and slightly greater than half of the research included compensation based on gambling outcomes within experiments. We discuss implications and future directions based on these observations of the published literature.",

The primary end point was the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) after the protocol treatment. Secondary endpoints included response rate (RR), overall survival (OS) and median survival time (MST). The interim analysis included data only from March 2011 to September 2013, who received six cycles of DDGP chemotherapy. A total of 25 eligible patients were enrolled. Seventeen patients (17/24, 70.83%) achieved complete response (CR) and four (4/24, 16.67%) achieved partial response (PR), three (3/24, 12.50%) had progressive disease (PD). The RR after treatment was 87.50%. After a median follow-up duration of 24.67 months (range 4-48 months). The 2-year PFS and OS rate were 61.80% (95% CI, 42.00% to 81.60%) and 68.50 % (95% CI, 48.70% to 88.30%), respectively. The MST was 36.55 months (95% CI, 29.41 months to 43.70 months).

  "27878205": "Iterative Development and Evaluation of a Pharmacogenomic -Guided Clinical Decision Support System for Warfarin Dosing Pharmacogenomic -guided dosing has the potential to improve patient outcomes but its implementation has been met with clinical challenges. Our objective was to develop and evaluate a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for pharmacogenomic -guided warfarin dosing designed for physicians and pharmacists. Twelve physicians and pharmacists completed 6 prescribing tasks using simulated patient scenarios in two iterations (development and validation phases) of a newly developed pharmacogenomic -driven CDSS prototype. For each scenario, usability was measured via efficiency, recorded as time to task completion, and participants ' perceived satisfaction which were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney U tests, respectively. Debrief interviews were conducted and qualitatively analyzed. Usability findings from the first (i.e. development) iteration were incorporated into the CDSS design for the second (i.e. validation) iteration. During the CDSS validation iteration, participants took more time to complete tasks with a median (IQR) of 183 (124-247) seconds versus 101 (73.5-197) seconds in the development iteration (p=0.01). This increase in time on task was due to the increase in time spent in the CDSS corresponding to several design changes. Efficiency differences that were observed between pharmacists and physicians in the development iteration were eliminated in the validation iteration. The increased use of the CDSS corresponded to a greater acceptance of CDSS recommended doses in the validation iteration (4% in the first iteration vs. 37.5% in the second iteration, p<0.001). Overall satisfaction did not change statistically between the iterations but the qualitative analysis revealed greater trust in the second prototype. A pharmacogenomic -guided CDSS has been developed using warfarin as the test drug. The final CDSS prototype was trusted by prescribers and significantly increased the time using the tool and acceptance of the recommended doses. This study is an important step toward incorporating pharmacogenomics into CDSS design for clinical testing.",

To study symptom support in these cases, we performed gastrostomies on 3 patients with V180I genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) who had become akinetic and mute, and compared them to 14 other similar patients being fed by tube. In the 3 gastrostomy cases, there were no direct complications due to the gastrostomy or tube feeding, nor were there episodes of discontinuation of tube feeding or initiation of continuous drip infusion due to severe complications. Antibiotics were administered for mild infections, a complication of CJD, with 0.2% and 8.8% of the total time after gastrostomy being used for intravenous or transluminal administration, respectively. We compared the present patient series with that of our previous report statistically, and found that patients undergoing gastrostomy required significantly fewer discontinuations of tube feeding than those who did not. No significant difference in antibiotic administration was found between groups, however. It is our conclusion that gastrostomy should be allowed for symptom support in akinetic patients with prion disease, but adequate informed consent must be provided to the patient's family.",

The endophyte strain AR37 (Epichloë festucae var. lolii) produces epoxy-janthitrem alkaloids and is the only endophyte known to provide ryegrass with resistance against porina larvae (Wiseana cervinata (Walker)), a major pasture pest in cooler areas of New Zealand. This study examined the effect of temperature on concentrations of epoxy-janthitrems in AR37 - infected ryegrass and determined how the resulting variations in concentration affected consumption, growth and survival of porina larvae. Twenty replicate pairs of perennial (Lolium perenne L.) and Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum Lam.) plants with and without endophyte were prepared by cloning, with one of each pair grown at either high (20°C) or low (7°C) temperature. After 10 weeks, herbage on each plant was harvested, divided into leaf and pseudostem, then freeze dried and ground. Leaf and pseudostem material was then incorporated separately into semi - synthetic diets which were fed to porina larvae in a bioassay over 3 weeks. Epoxy-janthitrem concentrations within the plant materials and the semi - synthetic diets were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. AR37 - infected ryegrass grown at high temperature contained high in plant a concentrations of epoxy-janthitrem (30.6 μg/g in leaves and 83.9 μg/g in pseudostems) that had a strong anti-feedant effect on porina larvae when incorporated into their diets, reducing their survival by 25-42% on pseudostems. In comparison, in planta epoxy-janthitrem concentrations in AR37 - infected ryegrass grown at low temperature were very low (0.67 μg/g in leaves and 7.4 μg/g in pseudostems) resulting in a small anti-feedant effect in perennial but not in Italian ryegrass. Although alkaloid concentrations were greatly reduced by low temperature this reduction did not occur until after 4 weeks of exposure. Alkaloid concentrations were slightly lower in Italian than in perennial ryegrass and concentrations were higher in the pseudostems when compared with the leaves. In conclusion, epoxy-janthitrems expressed by the AR37 endophyte show strong activity against porina larvae. However, when ryegrass plants are grown at a constant low temperature for an extended period of time in planta epoxy-janthitrem concentrations are greatly reduced and are less effective against this pasture pest.",
  "27919332": "Effects of ionizing radiation on the mammalian brain Epidemiological studies on the atomic-bomb survivors, cancer survivors and occupational cohorts provide strong evidence for multifaceted damage to brain after ionizing radiation. Radiation - induced late effects may manifest as brain tumors or cognitive impairment. Decreased neurogenesis and differentiation, alteration in neural structure and synaptic plasticity as well as increased oxidative stress and inflammation are suggested to contribute to adverse effects in the brain. In addition to neural stems cells, several brain -specific mature cell types including endothelial and glial cells are negatively affected by ionizing radiation. Radiation - induced enhancement of endothelial cell apoptosis results in disruption of the vascular system and the blood brain barrier. Activated microglia create inflammatory environment that negatively affects neuronal structures and results in decreased synaptic plasticity. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in radiation - induced brain injury remain elusive, first strategies for prevention and amelioration are being developed. Drug -based prevention and treatment focus mainly on the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation. Cell replacement therapy holds great promise as first animal studies using transplantation of neural stem cells to irradiated brain have been successful in restoring memory and cognition deficits. This review summarizes the epidemiological and biological data on radiation - induced brain damage and describes prevention and therapy methods to avoid and ameliorate these adverse effects, respectively.",

Data from 22 randomized, placebo-controlled global and local (Japan, China) registration studies of vildagliptin (50 mg once-daily or twice-daily) of ≥12-week duration were analysed by race (Caucasian [n = 2764] and Asian [n = 2232]) and by ethnicity (Japanese, Chinese, and Indian). The placebo-subtracted differences in the change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight from baseline to week 12 or week 24 were evaluated by race or ethnicity using repeated measure analysis of unstructured covariance. Hypoglycaemia incidences were summarized using descriptive statistics. The HbA1c reduction from baseline with vildagliptin was similar across the racial / ethnic subgroups (-0.83% ± 0.02% to -1.01% ± 0.05%). Placebo-corrected HbA1c reduction was similar between Caucasian (-0.68% ± 0.03%) and Asian (-0.80% ± 0.03%) patients (P value for interaction = .56); analysis by race and ethnicity showed better efficacy (P < .02) in Japanese patients. Japanese patients were drug-naïve and treated with a single oral anti-diabetes drug only; they showed no response to placebo. Weight neutrality of vildagliptin was demonstrated in all groups (0.47 ± 0.11 kg to -0.29 ± 0.08 kg). Hypoglycaemic events (≥1) were infrequent in all ethnic subgroups. The glycaemic efficacy of vildagliptin was similar in Caucasian and Asian patients. The slightly better efficacy observed in Japanese patients was driven by the absence of placebo effect and might be explained by their earlier stage of diabetes compared to other subgroups.",
  "27975020": "Divided and Sliding Superficial Temporal Artery Flap for Primary Donor-site Closure Superficial temporal artery (STA) flaps are often used for reconstruction of hair-bearing areas. However, primary closure of the donor site is not easy when the size of the necessary skin island is relatively large. In such cases, skin grafts are needed at the donor site, resulting in baldness. We have solved this issue by applying the divided and sliding flap technique, which was first reported for primary donor-site closure of a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap. We applied this technique to the hair-bearing STA flap, where primary donor-site closure is extremely beneficial for preventing baldness consequent to skin grafting. The STA flap was divided into 3, and creation of large flap was possible. Therefore, we concluded that the divided and sliding STA flap could at least partially solve the donor-site problem. Although further investigation is necessary to validate the maximum possible flap size, this technique may be applicable to at least small defects that are common after skin cancer ablation or trauma.",

The clinical outcomes were assessed by Mayo Elbow Score at the final follow-up visit. All patients were male, 4 of them having injury in the left hand as the non-dominant hand. Mean age of them was 34.5 years. All cases had small bony fleck in the posterior of elbow in lateral radiograph. Three patients had associated injuries -including intra-articular fractures and medial collateral ligament rupture. In one case V-Y plasty of the distal TB was done. In 4 patients the results of surgery were excellent, one was good and one was fair. Although TB tendon rupture is rare, it should be -considered in differential diagnosis of the upper -extremity trauma and its associated injuries should be addressed properly.",
  "28042065": "Civil Society -Driven Drug Policy Reform for Health and Human Welfare - India The lack of adequate access to opioids in India as analgesics and for agonist therapies, forces millions to live with severe unalleviated pain, or languish with suffering associated with drug dependence. Although India is a major opium exporter, the excessively prohibitive 1985 narcotics law formulated to control harmful use of drugs, impeded the availability and access to opioids for medical and scientific purposes. Amendment of this law in 2014 established a new national regulatory framework for improved access to essential opioid analgesics. This article reflects on key elements and processes that led to this landmark achievement. Unlike quick timelines associated with effecting policy reforms for law enforcement, realizing the 2014 drug policy change primarily to mitigate human suffering, was a 22-year-long process. The most exacting challenges included recognizing the multilayered complexities of the prior policy framework and understanding their adverse impact on field practices to chart an appropriate and viable path for reform. The evolution of an informal civil society movement involving health care professionals, lawyers, media, policy analysts, government officials, and the public was pivotal in addressing these challenges and garnering momentum for reform. The success of the effort for improving access to opioid medications was underpinned by a three-pronged strategy of 1) persuading the executive arm of the government to take interim enabling measures; 2) leveraging judicial intervention through public interest litigation; and 3) crafting a viable policy document for legislative approval and implementation. We hope our findings are useful for realizing drug policy reforms, given the current transformed global policy mandates emphasizing humanitarian, healthcare, and quality-of-life considerations.",
  "28393819": "Morphology of root canal surface: A reflection on the process of cementation of the composite relined glass fiber post The present study was conducted to evaluate the bond strength in the different root thirds (premolars and maxillary central incisors) of composite relined glass fiber posts compared to untreated glass fiber posts cemented with dual- or chemical-cure cements. Sixty human single-rooted premolars (flat canal) (n = 15) and 12 maxillary central incisors were used (round canal) (n = 3). The teeth were sectioned, and the roots received endodontic treatment. The standardized preparation of the canals was carried out, and the roots were randomly divided into four groups according to the cementation systems: G1: cemented posts (dual: Ambar / Allcem); G2: relined posts (dual: Ambar / Allcem); G3: cemented posts (chemical: Fusion Duralink / Cement Post); and G4: relined posts (chemical: Fusion Duralink / Cement Post). The roots were cut to give two slices of each third of the root canal per specimen. Push-out test was conducted at a speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc test (α = 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the premolars (flat canal) (P = 0.959). There was a significant difference in the central incisors between the middle and apical thirds in the cemented group when using the dual system (P = 0.04) and between the middle and apical thirds (P = 0.003) and cervical and apical thirds (P = 0.033) when using the chemical system. Due to the anatomy of the root canal, flat canal of the premolars does not require relining, but round canal of the maxillary central incisors demands it for more secure in the bond strength.",
  "27598153": "Nicotine Suppressed Fetal Adrenal StAR Expression via YY1 Mediated- Histone Deacetylation Modification Mechanism Steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein plays a pivotal role in steroidogenesis. Previously, we have demonstrated that prenatal nicotine exposure suppressed fetal adrenal steroidogenesis via steroidogenic factor 1 deacetylation. This study further explored the potential role of the transcriptional repressor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in nicotine -mediated StAR inhibition. Nicotine was subcutaneously administered (1.0 mg/kg) to pregnant rats twice per day and NCI-H295A cells were treated with nicotine. StAR and YY1 expression were analyzed by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. Histone modifications and the interactions between the YY1 and StAR promoter were assessed using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Prenatal nicotine exposure increased YY1 expression and suppressed StAR expression. ChIP assay showed that there was a decreasing trend for histone acetylation at the StAR promoter in fetal adrenal glands, whereas H3 acetyl-K14 at the YY1 promoter presented an increasing trend following nicotine exposure. Furthermore, in nicotine - treated NCI-H295A cells, nicotine enhanced YY1 expression and inhibited StAR expression. ChIP assay showed that histone acetylation decreased at the StAR promoter in NCI-H295A cells and that the interaction between the YY1 and StAR promoter increased. These data indicated that YY1 -medicated histone deacetylation modification in StAR promoters might play an important role in the inhibitory effect of nicotine on StAR expression.",
  "27384243": "Conditional ablation of myeloid TNF increases lesion volume after experimental stroke in mice, possibly via altered ERK1/2 signaling Microglia are activated following cerebral ischemia and increase their production of the neuro - and immunomodulatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). To address the function of TNF from this cellular source in focal cerebral ischemia we used TNF conditional knock out mice (LysMcreTNF(fl/fl)) in which the TNF gene was deleted in cells of the myeloid lineage, including microglia. The deletion reduced secreted TNF levels in lipopolysaccharide -stimulated cultured primary microglia by ~93%. Furthermore, phosphorylated-ERK / ERK ratios were significantly decreased in naïve LysMcreTNF(fl/fl) mice demonstrating altered ERK signal transduction. Micro-PET using (18)[F]-fluorodeoxyglucose immediately after focal cerebral ischemia showed increased glucose uptake in LysMcreTNF(fl/fl) mice, representing significant metabolic changes, that translated into increased infarct volumes at 24 hours and 5 days compared to littermates (TNFfl/fl). In naïve LysMcreTNF(fl/fl) mice cytokine levels were low and comparable to littermates. At 6 hours, TNF producing microglia were reduced by 56% in the ischemic cortex in LysMcreTNF(fl/fl) mice compared to littermate mice, whereas no TNF(+) leukocytes were detected. At 24 hours, pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-5 and CXCL1) levels were significantly lower in LysMcreTNF(fl/fl) mice, despite comparable infiltrating leukocyte populations. Our results identify microglia l TNF as beneficial and neuroprotective in the acute phase and as a modulator of neuroinflammation at later time points after experimental ischemia, which may contribute to regenerative recovery.",
  "27692274": "Sleep characteristics in type 1 diabetes and associations with glycemic control: systematic review and meta-analysis The association between inadequate sleep and type 2 diabetes has garnered much attention, but little is known about sleep and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our objectives were to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing sleep in persons with and without T1D, and to explore relationships between sleep and glycemic control in T1D. Studies were identified from Medline and Scopus. Studies reporting measures of sleep in T1D patients and controls, and/or associations between sleep and glycemic control, were selected. A total of 22 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. Children with T1D had shorter sleep duration (mean difference [MD] = -26.4 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -35.4, -17.7) than controls. Adults with T1D reported poorer sleep quality (MD in standardized sleep quality score = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33, 0.70), with higher scores reflecting worse sleep quality) than controls, but there was no difference in self - reported sleep duration. Adults with TID who reported sleeping >6 hours had lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels than those sleeping ≤6 hours (MD = -0.24%; 95% CI = -0.47, -0.02), and participants reporting good sleep quality had lower HbA1c than those with poor sleep quality (MD = -0.19%; 95% CI = -0.30, -0.08). The estimated prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults with TID was 51.9% (95% CI = 31.2, 72.6). Patients with moderate-to-severe OSA had a trend toward higher HbA1c (MD = 0.39%, 95% CI = -0.08, 0.87). T1D was associated with poorer sleep and high prevalence of OSA. Poor sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, and OSA were associated with suboptimal glycemic control in T1D patients.",
  "28538990": "Measuring nonlinear signal combination using EEG Relatively little is known about the processes, both linear and nonlinear, by which signals are combined beyond V1. By presenting two stimulus components simultaneously, flickering at different temporal frequencies (frequency tagging) while measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials, we can assess responses to the individual components, including direct measurements of suppression on each other, and various nonlinear responses to their combination found at intermodulation frequencies. The result is a rather rich dataset of frequencies at which responses can be found. We presented pairs of sinusoidal gratings at different temporal frequencies, forming plaid patterns that were \" coherent \" (looking like a checkerboar d) and \" noncoherent \" (looking like a pair of transparently overlaid gratings), and found clear intermodulation responses to compound stimuli, indicating nonlinear summation. This might have been attributed to cross-orientation suppression except that the pattern of intermodulation responses differed for coherent and noncoherent patterns, whereas the effects of suppression (measured at the component frequencies) did not. A two-stage model of nonlinear summation involving conjunction detection with a logical AND gate described the data well, capturing the difference between coherent and noncoherent plaids over a wide array of possible response frequencies. Multistimulus frequency -tagged EEG in combination with computational modeling may be a very valuable tool in studying the conjunction of these signals. In the current study the results suggest a second-order mechanism responding selectively to coherent plaid patterns.",
  "28524704": "Radiation from wireless technology elevates blood glucose and body temperature in 40-year-old type 1 diabetic male A type 1 diabetic male reports multiple instances when his blood glucose was dramatically elevated by the presence of microwave radiation from wireless technology and plummeted when the radiation exposure ended. In one instance, his body temperature elevated in addition to his blood glucose. Both remained elevated for nearly 48 h after exposure with the effect gradually decreasing. Possible mechanisms for microwave radiation elevating blood glucose include effects on glucose transport proteins and ion channels, insulin conformational changes and oxidative stress. Temperature elevation may be caused by microwave radiation - triggered Ca (2+) efflux, a mechanism similar to malignant hyperthermia. The potential for radiation from wireless technology to cause serious biological effects has important implications and necessitates a reevaluation of its near-ubiquitous presence, especially in hospitals and medical facilities.",

In disorder condition, what is the first one: metabolic diseases cause inflammation or conversely? This \"chicken or egg\" type question was hard to answer. However, instead of focusing on this difficult issue, we should ask another challenging question: what are the links between inflammation and metabolic diseases? Seizing the key from this chaos may be the best way to solve the problem and break the cycle. To answer this question, we review the regulators (such as NF-κB, PPARs, mTOR, and STAT3) that have important roles in both metabolism and inflammation. These \" bridge proteins \" that link metabolic diseases and inflammation not only increase our understanding of these two diseases, but also provide potential targets for therapeutics and practical clinical applications.",
  "28088240": "Feasibility of an altruistic sperm donation program in Canada: results from a population-based model Stringent donor - screening criteria and legislation prohibiting payment for donor gametes have contributed to the radical decline of donor insemination (DI) using sperm provided by Canadian men. Thus, many individuals rely on imported sperm. This paper examines the feasibility of an altruistic sperm donation (ASD) program to meet the needs of Canadians. Using Canadian census data, published literature and expert opinions, two population-based, top-down mathematical models were developed to estimate the supply and demand for donor sperm and the feasibility of an ASD program. It was estimated that 63 donors would pass Canadian screening criteria, which would provide 1,575 donations. The demand for DI by women was 7,866 samples (4,319 same sex couples, 1,287 single women and 2,260 heterosexual couples). Considerable effort would be necessary to create the required increase in awareness of the program and change in societal behaviour towards sperm donation for an ASD program to be feasible in Canada.",
  "28184394": "Tracing cytotoxic effects of small organic Se species in human liver cells back to total cellular Se and Se metabolites Small selenium (Se) species play a major role in the metabolism, excretion and dietary supply of the essential trace element selenium. Human cells provide a valuable tool for investigating currently unresolved issues on the cellular mechanisms of Se toxicity and metabolism. In this study, we developed two isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma tandem-mass spectrometry based methods and applied them to human hepatoma cells (HepG2) in order to quantitatively elucidate total cellular Se concentrations and cellular Se species transformations in relation to the cytotoxic effects of four small organic Se species. Species - and incubation time - dependent results were obtained: the two major urinary excretion metabolites trimethylselenonium (TMSe) and methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-β-d-galactopyranoside (SeSugar 1) were taken up by the HepG2 cells in an unmodified manner and did not considerably contribute to the Se pool. In contrast, Se-methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys) and selenomethionine (SeMet) were taken up in higher amounts, they were largely incorporated by the cells (most likely into proteins) and metabolized to other small Se species. Two new metabolites of MeSeCys, namely γ-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine and Se-methylselenoglutathione, were identified by means of HPLC-electrospray-ionization-Orbitrap-MS. They are certainly involved in the (de-)toxification modes of Se metabolism and require further investigation.",
  "28046142": "Nitrogen utilization efficiency and prediction of nitrogen excretion in sheep offered fresh perennial ryegrass () Nitrogen excretion from sheep production systems is an important source of nitrate, ammonia, and nitrous oxide responsible for groundwater pollution and global warming. The present study aimed to identify key parameters influencing N utilization efficiency and develop prediction equations for manure N, feces N, and urine N outputs in sheep. Data used were collected from 82 sheep offered fresh perennial ryegrass () as the sole diet in 6 metabolism experiments (data from non-grass-only diets were not used). Sheep were from breeds of Highlander, Texel, Scottish Blackface, and Swaledale at the age of 5 to 18 mo and weighing from 24.5 to 62.7 kg. Herbage was harvested daily from 6 swards of contrasting harvest dates (May to December), offering wide variation in feed value to cover the range that would be offered in most practical farm situations. Before the commencement of each study, the experimental sward was harvested at a residual height of 4 cm and allowed to grow for 2 to 4 wk to target an average pregrazing sward height in a range of 8 to 15 cm depending on the time of year. Sheep were housed in individual pens for 14 d and then transferred to individual metabolism crates for 4 d with feed intake and feces and urine outputs measured. Data were analyzed using the linear mixed model procedure to develop prediction equations for feces N, urine N, and manure N outputs using N intake, herbage chemical composition, and digestibility with effects of sex, breed, and experimental periods removed. Nitrogen intake was the best single predictor for N output in feces, urine, and manure, and the value for prediction of manure N output was greater than those for feces N and urine N (0.86 vs. 0.70 and 0.77, respectively; < 0.001). Animal BW and herbage DM, ether extract, NDF, ADF, water soluble carbohydrate, and DE concentrations and N digestibility were also used to predict N outputs because N intake may not be available in commercial practice. The prediction equations for N utilizatio n efficiency indicated that increasing feeding level and ME concentration and reducing N concentration could improve N utilization efficiency and shift N excretion into feces rather than urine (< 0.001). The equations developed in the current study provide an approach for sheep producers to quantify N excretion against production and, consequently, to develop their own mitigation strategies to reduce the environmental impact of sheep production systems.",
  "27449818": "Estradiol prodrugs (EP) for efficient oral estrogen treatment and abolished effects on estrogen modulated liver functions Oral compared to parenteral estrogen administration is characterized by reduced systemic but prominent hepatic estrogenic effects on lipids, hemostatic factors, GH -/ IGF I axis, angiotensinogen. In order to avoid such adverse metabolic effects of oral treatment, estradiol (E2) prodrugs (EP) were designed which bypass the liver tissue as inactive molecules. Carbone17-OH sulfonamide [-O2-NH2] substituted esters of E2 (EC508, others) were synthesized and tested for carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) binding. CA II in erythrocytes is thought to oppose extraction of EP from portal vein blood during liver passage. Ovariectomized (OVX, day minus 14) rats were orally treated once daily from day 1-3. Sacrifice day 4. Uteri were dissected and weighed. Cholesterol fractions and angiotensinogen were determined in plasma. Oral E2 and ethinyl estradiol (EE) generated dose related uterine growth and important hepatic estrogenic effects. EP induced uterine growth at about hundred-fold lower doses. This was possible with almost absent effects on plasma cholesterol or angiotensinogen. Preliminary pharmacokinetic studies with EC508 used intravenous and oral administration in male rats. Resulting blood levels revealed complete oral bioavailability. Further high blood - but low plasma concentrations indicated erythrocyte binding of EC508 in vivo as potential mechanism of low extraction at liver passage. Very high systemic estrogenicity combined with markedly lower or absent adverse hepatic estrogenic effects is evidence for a systemic release of E2 from sulfonamide EP. In conclusion, tested oral EP bypass the liver in erythrocytes furnishing systemic estradiol at hydrolysis. This mechanism avoids the hepatic estrogenic impact of conventional oral estrogen therapy.",
  "28485130": "Fluorescence hyperspectral imaging (fHSI) using a spectrally resolved detector array The ability to resolve multiple fluorescent emissions from different biological targets in video rate applications, such as endoscopy and intraoperative imaging, has traditionally been limited by the use of filter-based imaging systems. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) facilitates the detection of both spatial and spectral information in a single data acquisition, however, instrumentation for HSI is typically complex, bulky and expensive. We sought to overcome these limitations using a novel robust and low cost HSI camera based on a spectrally resolved detector array (SRDA). We integrated this HSI camera into a wide-field reflectance-based imaging system operating in the near-infrared range to assess the suitability for in vivo imaging of exogenous fluorescent contrast agents. Using this fluorescence HSI (fHSI) system, we were able to accurately resolve the presence and concentration of at least 7 fluorescent dyes in solution. We also demonstrate high spectral unmixing precision, signal linearity with dye concentration and at depth in tissue mimicking phantoms, and delineate 4 fluorescent dyes in vivo. Our approach, including statistical background removal, could be directly generalised to broader spectral ranges, for example, to resolve tissue reflectance or autofluorescence and in future be tailored to video rate applications requiring snapshot HSI data acquisition.",
  "27859264": "Inwardly rectifying K(+) channels are major contributors to flow - induced vasodilatation in resistance arteries Endothelial inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir2.1) channels regulate flow - induced vasodilatation via nitric oxide (NO) in mouse mesenteric resistance arteries. Deficiency of Kir2.1 channels results in elevated blood pressure and increased vascular resistance. Flow - induced vasodilatation in human resistance arteries is also regulated by inwardly rectifying K(+) channels. This study presents the first direct evidence that Kir channels play a critical role in physiological endothelial responses to flow. Inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channels are known to be sensitive to flow, but their role in flow - induced endothelial responses is not known. The goal of this study is to establish the role of Kir channels in flow - induced vasodilatation and to provide first insights into the mechanisms responsible for Kir signalling in this process. First, we establish that primary endothelial cells isolated from murine mesenteric arteries express functional Kir2.1 channels sensitive to shear stress. Then, using the Kir2.1(+/-) heterozygous mouse model, we establish that downregulation of Kir2.1 results in significant decrease in shear - activated Kir currents and inhibition of endothelium -dependent flow - induced vasodilatation (FIV) assayed in pressurized mesenteric arteries pre-constricted with endothelin-1. Deficiency in Kir2.1 also results in the loss of flow - induced phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt, as well as inhibition of NO generation. All the effects are fully rescued by endothelial cell (EC)-specific overexpression of Kir2.1. A component of FIV that is Kir independent is abrogated by blocking Ca(2+) -sensitive K(+) channels. Kir2.1 has no effect on endothelium -independent and K(+) - induced vasodilatation in denuded arteries. Kir2.1(+/-) mice also show increased mean blood pressure measured by carotid artery cannulation and increased microvascular resistance measured using a tail-cuff. Importantly, blocking Kir channels also inhibits flow - induced vasodilatation in human subcutaneous adipose microvessels. Endothelial Kir channels contribute to FIV of mouse mesenteric arteries via an NO -dependent mechanism, whereas Ca(2+) -sensitive K(+) channels mediate FIV via an NO -independent pathway. Kir2 channels also regulate vascular resistance and blood pressure. Finally, Kir channels also contribute to FIV in human subcutaneous microvessels.",
  "27447421": "The relationship between hemorheological parameters and mortality in critically ill patients with and without sepsis The prognostic scoring systems for mortality of intensive care patients estimate clinical outcome using several physiological and biochemical parameters. In altered hemodynamic conditions of critically ill patients, hemorheological variables may play a significant role in appropriate tissue perfusion. We investigated if hemorheological parameters are altered in critical status and if they could be markers of mortality. 112 patients (67.8 ± 12 years, 58 males, 54 females) treated in intensive care unit with different non-surgical diseases were investigated. Routine laboratory parameters and prognostic scores were determined and hemorheological variables (hematocrit, plasma and whole blood viscosity, red blood cell aggregation and deformability) were measured on the 1st and the 2nd day after admission. ICU scores predicted 35.2-41.3% mortality rate, real mortality in intensive care unit was 37.5%, while 30-day mortality was 46.6%. Whole blood viscosity (WBV) and red blood cell (RBC) deformability were lower, red blood cell aggregation was higher in septic than in nonseptic patients (p < 0.05). In septic patients calcium was increased, osmolality was decreased, while in nonseptic patients WBV and RBC aggregation were higher in nonsurvivors compared to survivors (p < 0.05). Worsening of RBC deformability from day 1 to day 2 predicted higher mortality (p < 0.05). Calcium and osmolality level were associated with outcome in sepsis. Whole blood viscosity, red blood cell aggregation and change in red blood cell deformability could predict mortality in nonseptic patients and they may add prognostic information over the ICU scores. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the benefit of our findings in clinical practice.",

The principle of agricultural - purpose FDR sensors and the process for embedding this kind of sensors for subgrade engineering purposes are introduced. Based on field measured weather data, a numerical analysis model for temperature and moisture content in the subgrade's soil is built. Comparisons of the temperature and moisture data obtained from numerical simulation and FDR -based measurements are conducted. The results show that: (1) the embedding method and process, data acquisition, and remote transmission presented are reasonable; (2) the temperature and moisture changes are coordinated with the atmospheric environment and they are also in close agreement with numerical calculations; (3) the change laws of both are consistent at positions where the subgrade is compacted uniformly. These results suggest that the data measured by the agricultural - purpose FDR sensors are reliable. The findings of this paper enable a new and effective real-time monitoring method for a subgrade's temperature and moisture changes, and thus broaden the application of agricultural - purpose FDR sensors.",

Here we have examined how, during development, the cells of these two issues become isolated from each other. Epithelia from the anterior eyes of chicken embryos were labeled with the fluorescent, lipophilic dye, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI). DiI was placed on the epithelial surface of the developing anterior eye and its diffusion was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Concomitant morphologic changes in the surface cells of these epithelial were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Immunofluorescence was used to analyze the expression of cytokeratin K3, ZO-1, N-cadherin and Connexin-43 and the function of gap junctions was analyzed using a cut-loading with the fluorescent dye rhodamine-dextran. Prior to embryonic day 8 (E 8), DiI placed on the surface of the CE spreads throughout all the epithelial cells of the anterior eye. When older eyes were similarly labeled, dye diffusion was restricted to the CE. Similarly, diffusion of DiI placed on the conjunctival surface after E 8 was restricted to the conjunctiva. Scanning electron microscopy showed that developmentally (1) physical separations progressively form between the cells of the CE and those of the conjunctiva, and (2) by E 8 these separations form a ring that completely encompasses the cornea. The functional restriction of gap junctions between these tissues did not occur until E 14. During ocular development, a barrier to the diffusion of DiI forms between the contiguous CE and conjunctiva prior to the differential expression of gap junctions within these tissues.",
  "28481342": "Recurrent noncoding regulatory mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma The contributions of coding mutations to tumorigenesis are relatively well known; however, little is known about somatic alterations in noncoding DNA. Here we describe GECCO (Genomic Enrichment Computational Clustering Operation) to analyze somatic noncoding alterations in 308 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) and identify commonly mutated regulatory regions. We find recurrent noncoding mutations to be enriched in PDA pathways, including axon guidance and cell adhesion, and newly identified processes, including transcription and homeobox genes. We identified mutations in protein binding sites correlating with differential expression of proximal genes and experimentally validated effects of mutations on expression. We developed an expression modulation score that quantifies the strength of gene regulation imposed by each class of regulatory elements, and found the strongest elements were most frequently mutated, suggesting a selective advantage. Our detailed single-cancer analysis of noncoding alterations identifies regulatory mutations as candidates for diagnostic and prognostic markers, and suggests new mechanisms for tumor evolution.",
  "27317655": "Systematic and detailed analysis of behavioural tests in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke: Tests for long-term assessment In order to test therapeutics, functional assessments are required. In pre-clinical stroke research, there is little consensus regarding the most appropriate behavioural tasks to assess deficits, especially when testing over extended times in milder models with short occlusion times and small lesion volumes. In this study, we comprehensively assessed 16 different behavioural tests, with the aim of identifying those that show robust, reliable and stable deficits for up to two months. These tasks are regularly used in stroke research, as well as being useful for examining striatal dysfunction in models of Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Two cohorts of male Wistar rats underwent the intraluminal filament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (30 min) and were imaged 24 h later. This resulted in primarily subcortical infarcts, with a small amount of cortical damage. Animals were tested, along with sham and naïve groups at 24 h, seven days, and one and two months. Following behavioural testing, brains were processed and striatal neuronal counts were performed alongside measurements of total brain and white matter atrophy. The staircase, adjusting steps, rotarod and apomorphine -induced rotations were the most reliable for assessing long-term deficits in the 30 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke.",
  "27806921": "Simulating the potential role of media coverage and infected bats in the 2014 Ebola outbreak Multiple epidemiological models have been developed to model the transmission dynamics of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in West Africa in 2014 because the severity of the epidemic is commonly overestimated. A compartmental model that incorporates the media impact and the effect of infected bats was constructed and calibrated using data reported until the end of 2014. The final cumulative number of deaths and confirmed cases were estimated to be 1.0921×10(4) (95% CI 9.7706×10(3)-1.2072×10(4)) and 1.5193×10(4) (95% CI 1.3593×10(4)-1.6795×10(4)), respectively. The epidemic was estimated to end on June 2015, which was similar to the data reported by the World Health Organization. A sensitivity analysis indicated that an increase of either the media impact or the number of infectious bats that are captured daily can increase the cumulative number of confirmed cases / deaths. Of the considered epidemiological parameters, only the media coverage can significantly reduce both the peak time and the value of the cumulative confirmed cases / deaths. Thus, we propose 'the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths ' as another media mechanism. In conclusion, the media impact contributed to the control of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and infectious bats may be a potential source of the epidemic.",
  "28056457": "Personalised Medicine: A New Approach to Improving Health in Indigenous Australian Populations Personalised medicine is a newly emerging field with much to offer to all populations in improved clinical treatment options. Since the 1970s, clinicians and researchers have all been working towards improving the health of Indigenous Australians. However, there has been little research on the impact of genetics on Indigenous health, how genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to poor health in Indigenous people, and how genetic factors specific to Indigenous people affect their responses to particular treatments. This short review highlights the urgent need for more genetic studies specific to Indigenous people in order to provide more appropriate care and to improve health outcomes. This paper explores why genetic work with Indigenous communities has been limited, how personalised medicine could benefit Indigenous communities, and highlights a number of specific instances in which personalised medicine has been critical for improving morbidity and mortality in other high-risk groups. In order to take the next step in advancing the health of Indigenous peoples, targeted research into the genetic factors behind chronic diseases is critically needed. This research may allow clinicians a better understanding of how genetic factors interact with environmental factors to influence an Indigenous Australian's individual risk of disease, prognosis, and response to therapies. It is hoped that this knowledge will produce clinical interventions that will help deliver clearly targeted, more appropriate care to this at-risk population.",

The present study aimed to investigate occurrence and effect of nodal skip metastases in thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. All 578 patients undergoing esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at the Center for Esophageal Diseases located in Padova between January 1992 and December 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Selection criteria were R0 resection, pathological M0 stage and pathological lymph node involvement. Patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. The selection identified 88 patients with lymph node involvement confirmed by pathological evaluation. Sixteen patients (18.2%) had nodal skip metastasis. Adjusting for the number of lymph node metastases, patient with nodal skip metastasis had similar 5-year overall survival (14% vs. 13%, p = 0.93) and 5-year disease free survival (14% vs. 9%, p = 0.48) compared to patients with both peritumoral and distant lymph node metastases. The risk difference of nodal skip metastasis was: -24.1% (95% C.I. -43.1% to -5.2%) in patients with more than one lymph node metastasis compared to those with one lymph node metastasis; -2.3% (95% C.I. -29.8% to 25.2%) in middle thoracic esophagus and -23.0% (95% C.I. -47.8% to 1.8%) in lower thoracic esophagus compared to upper thoracic esophagus; 18.1% (95% C.I. 3.2% to 33.0%) in clinical N0 stage vs. clinical N+ stage. Nodal skip metastasis is a common pattern of metastatic lymph involvement in thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, neither overall survival nor disease free survival are associated with nodal skip metastasis occurrence.",
  "27512256": "The effects of gait time and trunk acceleration ratio during stair climbing in old-old adult females [Purpose] This study investigated the effects of gait time and trunk acceleration ratio in old-old adult females during stair climbing. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-five older adult females who were able to walk independently volunteered for this study and were categorized into two age groups (older adults or old-old adults). Gait time and trunk acceleration ratio were measured using an accelerometer during stair climbing. [Results] Gait time and trunk acceleration ratio when climbing stairs were significantly higher in the old-old age group than in the older adults group. [Conclusions] These findings suggest that old-old females have decreased upper trunk control. In addition, gait time and the trunk acceleration ratio during stair climbing are useful clinical markers for predicting function and balance control ability in old-old elderly populations.",
  "27485749": "Adenosine A2A receptors in the olfactory bulb suppress rapid eye movement sleep in rodents Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder in humans is often accompanied by a reduced ability to smell and detect odors, and olfactory bulbectomized rats exhibit increased REM sleep, suggesting that the olfactory bulb (OB) is involved in REM-sleep regulation. However, the molecular mechanism of REM-sleep regulation by the OB is unknown. Adenosine promotes sleep and its A2A receptors (A2AR) are expressed in the OB. We hypothesized that A2AR in the OB regulate REM sleep. Bilateral microinjections of the A2AR antagonist SCH58261 into the rat OB increased REM sleep, whereas microinjections of the A2AR agonist CGS21680 decreased REM sleep. Similar to the A2AR antagonist, selective A2AR knockdown by adeno-associated virus carrying short-hairpin RNA for A2AR in the rat OB increased REM sleep. Using chemogenetics on the basis of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, we demonstrated that the inhibition of A2AR neurons increased REM sleep, whereas the activation of these neurons decreased REM sleep. Moreover, using a conditional anterograde axonal tract-tracing approach, we found that OB A2AR neurons innervate the piriform cortex and olfactory tubercle. These novel findings indicate that adenosine suppresses REM sleep via A2AR in the OB of rodents.",
  "28513195": "Binge drinking: Health impact, prevalence, correlates and interventions Binge drinking (also called heavy episodic drinking, risky single-occasion drinking etc.) is a major public health problem. This paper provides an overview of recently published evidence concerning the definition and measuremen t, prevalence rates, health impact, demographic and psychosocial correlates of, and interventions for, binge drinking. Narrative review. Mostly occurring among young people at weekends, binge drinking increases the risk of both acute (e.g. injuries) and long-term negative consequences (e.g. alcohol disorders). Binge drinkers tend to be extrovert, impulsive and sensation-seeking. Stress, anxiety, traumatic events and depression are also related to binge drinking. Both alcohol-related behaviour of parents and general parenting (e.g. parenting styles, monitoring) are also important. Other major risk factors for binge drinking are frequently spending time with friends who drink, and the drinking norms observed in the wider social environment (e.g. school, community, culture). Emergency departments, birthday parties, fraternities and the workplace serve as settings for interventions; these are increasingly delivered via digital and mobile technology. There is evidence of small-sized effects across approaches (brief interventions, personalised normative feedback, protective behavioural strategies etc.) and populations. A more consistent terminology, investigating multi-level influences and identifying the most effective intervention components are challenges for future research.",

Technical barriers in the direct observation of small proteins or therapeutic agents can limit our knowledge of how they function in solution and in the body. Electron microscopy (EM) imaging performed in a liquid environment permits us to peer into the active world of cells and molecules at the nanoscale. Here, we employ liquid cell EM to directly visualize a protein-based therapeutic in its native conformation and aggregate state in a time-resolved manner. In combination with quantitative analyses, information from this work contributes new molecular insights toward understanding the behaviours of immunotherapies in a solution state that mimics the human body.",
  "28207880": "Skeletal muscle metabolic adaptations to endurance exercise training are attainable in mice with simvastatin treatment We tested the hypothesis that a 6-week regimen of simvastatin would attenuate skeletal muscle adaptation to low-intensity exercise. Male C57BL/6J wildtype mice were subjected to 6-weeks of voluntary wheel running or normal cage activities with or without simvastatin treatment (20 mg/kg/d, n = 7-8 per group). Adaptations in in vivo fatigue resistance were determined by a treadmill running test, and by ankle plantarflexor contractile assessment. The tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and plantaris muscles were evaluated for exercised -induced mitochondrial adaptations (i.e., biogenesis, function, autophagy). There was no difference in weekly wheel running distance between control and simvastatin - treated mice (P = 0.51). Trained mice had greater treadmill running distance (296%, P<0.001), and ankle plantarflexor contractile fatigue resistance (9%, P<0.05) compared to sedentary mice, independent of simvastatin treatment. At the cellular level, trained mice had greater mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., ~2-fold greater PGC1α expression, P<0.05) and mitochondrial content (e.g., 25% greater citrate synthase activity, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment. Mitochondrial autophagy -related protein contents were greater in trained mice (e.g., 40% greater Bnip3, P<0.05), independent of simvastatin treatment. However, Drp1, a marker of mitochondrial fission, was less in simvastatin treated mice, independent of exercise training, and there was a significant interaction between training and statin treatment (P<0.022) for LC3-II protein content, a marker of autophagy flux. These data indicate that whole body and skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance exercise training are attainable with simvastatin treatment, but simvastatin may have side effects on muscle mitochondrial maintenance via autophagy, which could have long-term implications on muscle health.",
  "27526663": "Differential control and function of Arabidopsis ProDH1 and ProDH2 genes on infection with biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens Arabidopsis contains two proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) genes, ProDH1 and ProDH2, encoding for homologous and functional isoenzymes. Although ProDH1 has been studied extensively, especially under abiotic stress, ProDH2 has only started to be analysed in recent years. These genes display distinctive expression patterns and show weak transcriptional co-regulation, but are both activated in pathogen - infected tissues. We have demonstrated previously that Arabidopsis plants with silenced ProDH1 / 2 expression fail to trigger defences against the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato AvrRpm1 (Pst-AvrRpm1), and that ProDH1 and ProDH2 are differentially regulated by salicylic acid (SA). In the current work, we used prodh1 and prodh2 single- mutant plants to assess the particular contribution of each gene to resistance against Pst-AvrRpm1 and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. In addition, we studied the sensitivity of ProDH1 and ProDH2 to the jasmonic acid (JA) defence pathway. We found that ProDH1 and ProDH2 are both necessary to achieve maximum resistance against Pst-AvrRpm1 and B. cinerea. However, ProDH2 has a major effect on early restriction of B. cinerea growth. Interestingly, ProDH1 is up-regulated by SA and JA, whereas ProDH2 is only activated by JA, and both genes display transcriptional inter-regulation at basal and infection conditions. These studies provide the first evidence of the contribution of ProDH2 to disease resistance, and describe the differential regulation and non-redundant but complementary function of both enzyme isoforms in infected tissues, providing support for a fundamental role of ProDH in the control of biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens.",
  "28390176": "Cucurbitacin B Protects Against Pressure Overload Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy Lack of effective anti-cardiac hypertrophy drugs creates a major cause for the increasing prevalence of heart failure. In the present study, we determined the anti-hypertrophy and anti-fibrosis potential of a natural plant triterpenoid, Cucurbitacin B both in vitro and in vivo. Aortic banding (AB) was performed to induce cardiac hypertrophy. After 1 week of surgery, mice were receive cucurbitacin B treatment (Gavage, 0.2 mg/kg body weight /2 day). After 4 weeks of AB, cucurbitacin B demonstrated a strong anti-hypertrophy and -fibrosis ability as evidenced by decreased of heart weight, myocardial cell cross-sectional area and interstitial fibrosis, ameliorated of systolic and diastolic abnormalities, normalized in gene expression of hypertrophic and fibrotic markers, reserved microvascular density in pressure overload induced hypertrophic mice. Cucurbitacin B also showed significant hypertrophy inhibitory effect in phenylephrine stimulated cardiomyocytes. The Cucurbitacin B -mediated mitigated cardiac hypertrophy was attributable to the increasing level of autophagy, which was associated with the blockade of Akt / mTOR / FoxO3a signal pathway, validated by SC79, MK2206, and 3-MA, the Akt agonist, inhibitor and autophagy inhibitor in vitro. The overexpression of constitutively active Akt completely abolished the Cucurbitacin B -mediated protection of cardiac hypertrophy in human cardiomyocytes AC16. Collectively, our findings suggest that cucurbitacin B protects against cardiac hypertrophy through increasing the autophagy level in cardiomyocytes, which is associated with the inhibition of Akt / mTOR / FoxO3a signal axis.

  "27348675": "Gender Authorship Trends of Plastic Surgery Research in the United States An increasing number of women are entering the medical profession, but plastic surgery remains a male - dominated profession, especially within academia. As academic aspirations and advancement depend largely on research productivity, the authors assessed the number of articles authored by women published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. Original articles in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery published during the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2004, and 2014 were analyzed. First and senior authors with an M.D. degree and U.S. institutional affiliation were categorized by gender. Authorship trends were compared with those from other specialties. Findings were placed in the context of gender trends among plastic surgery residents in the United States. The percentage of female authors in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery increased from 2.4 percent in 1970 to 13.3 percent in 2014. Over the same time period, the percentage of female plastic surgery residents increased from 2.6 percent to 32.5 percent. By 2014, there were more female first authors (19.1 percent) than senior authors (7.7 percent) (p < 0.001). As a field, plastic surgery had fewer female authors than other medical specialties including pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, general surgery, internal medicine, and radiation oncology (p < 0.05). The increase in representation of female authors in plastic surgery is encouraging but lags behind advances in other specialties. Understanding reasons for these trends may help improve gender equity in academic plastic surgery.",
  "28543041": "The added value of cardiac index and pulse pressure variation monitoring to mean arterial pressure - guided volume therapy in moderate-risk abdominal surgery (COGUIDE): a pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial There is disagreement regarding the benefits of goal-directed therapy in moderate-risk abdominal surgery. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of non-invasive cardiac index and pulse pressure variation monitoring to mean arterial pressure -based goal-directed therapy would reduce the incidence of postoperative complications in patients having moderate-risk abdominal surgery. In this pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial, we randomly allocated 244 patients by envelope drawing in a 1:1 fashion, stratified per centre. All patients had mean arterial pressure, cardiac index and pulse pressure variation measured continuously. In one group, healthcare professionals were blinded to cardiac index and pulse pressure variation values and were asked to guide haemodynamic therapy only based on mean arterial pressure (control group). In the second group, cardiac index and pulse pressure variation values were displayed and kept within target ranges following a pre-defined algorithm (CI-PPV group). The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications within 30 days. One hundred and seventy-five patients were eligible for final analysis. Overall complication rates were similar (42/94 (44.7%) vs. 38/81 (46.9%) in the control and CI-PPV groups, respectively; p = 0.95). The CI-PPV group had lower mean (SD) pulse pressure variation values (9.5 (2.0)% vs. 11.9 (4.6)%; p = 0.003) and higher mean (SD) cardiac indices (2.76 (0.62) l min(-1) .m(-2) vs. 2.53 (0.66) l min(-1) .m(-2); p = 0.004) than the control group. In moderate-risk abdominal surgery, we observed no additional value of cardiac index and pulse pressure variation - guided haemodynamic therapy to mean arterial pressure - guided volume therapy with regard to postoperative complications.",
  "28509318": "The duration of pregnancy in ecologically-challenged area. The effects of environmental pollution with aromatic hydrocarbons on the angiogenesis and elements of the mesenchymal tissue of the human placenta The literature presents only few reports regarding the effects of elevated levels of aromatic hydrocarbons (AH) on the functions of the human placenta. The effects of environmental contamination with AH (including phenol and 1-hydroxypyrene) have certain negative effects on parenchymal organs such as human placenta. The paper aimed to assess the effects of elevated levels of AH on the placental angiogenesis and elements of the mesenchymal tissue of the placenta. Tissue material from 50 afterbirths from Płock constituted a study group, whereas 50 afterbirths from Kutno constituted a control group. Immunohistochemical reactions with the peroxidase method using LSAB kits (DAKO) were performed. The extent and intensity of reactions were analysed. The levels of phenols and 1-hydroxypyrene in the excreted urine of pregnant women (undergoing delivery) were detected using gas chromatography and colorimetry. The levels of phenol and 1-hydroxypyrene in the excreted urine were demonstrated to be statistically significantly higher in patients living in the area of Płock. Statistically significantly higher expression of antibodies indicating placental angiogenesis was observed in the placentas in the Płock group (p < 0.01). Moreover, lower expression of vimentin indicating reactions with proteins in mesenchymal cells was observed in the Kutno group (p < 0.01). Pregnancy in the environment with elevated levels of aromatic hydrocarbons has detrimental effects on the human placenta. The foetus is protected by activation of adaptation and compensation mechanisms that are manifested as significant angiogenesis and greater development and differentiation of mesenchymal cells compared to the control group.",
  "27908689": "PCSK9 genetic variants and risk of type 2 diabetes: a mendelian randomisation study Statin treatment and variants in the gene encoding HMG-CoA reductase are associated with reductions in both the concentration of LDL cholesterol and the risk of coronary heart disease, but also with modest hyperglycaemia, increased bodyweight, and modestly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, which in no way offsets their substantial benefits. We sought to investigate the associations of LDL cholesterol -lowering PCSK9 variants with type 2 diabetes and related biomarkers to gauge the likely effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on diabetes risk. In this mendelian randomisation study, we used data from cohort studies, randomised controlled trials, case control studies, and genetic consortia to estimate associations of PCSK9 genetic variants with LDL cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, fasting insulin, bodyweight, waist-to-hip ratio, BMI, and risk of type 2 diabetes, using a standardised analysis plan, meta-analyses, and weighted gene-centric scores. Data were available for more than 550 000 individuals and 51 623 cases of type 2 diabetes. Combined analyses of four independent PCSK9 variants (rs11583680, rs11591147, rs2479409, and rs11206510) scaled to 1 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol showed associations with increased fasting glucose (0·09 mmol/L, 95% CI 0·02 to 0·15), bodyweight (1·03 kg, 0·24 to 1·82), waist-to-hip ratio (0·006, 0·003 to 0·010), and an odds ratio for type diabetes of 1·29 (1·11 to 1·50). Based on the collected data, we did not identify associations with HbA1c (0·03%, -0·01 to 0·08), fasting insulin (0·00%, -0·06 to 0·07), and BMI (0·11 kg/m(2), -0·09 to 0·30). PCSK9 variants associated with lower LDL cholesterol were also associated with circulating higher fasting glucose concentration, bodyweight, and waist-to-hip ratio, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. In trials of PCSK9 inhibitor drugs, investigators should carefully assess these safety outcomes and quantify the risks and benefits of PCSK9 inhibitor treatment, as was previously done for statins.

We reviewed results from initial screenings administered at 6 Veterans Administration primary care clinics for the homeless and responses from clinic staff members interviewed about the screening program. A total of 270 patients were screened. The average age was 53 years, and most were male (93.1%). Screening showed a high prevalence of food insecurity. Of the 270, 48.5% reported they experienced food insecurity in the previous 3 months, 55.0% reported averaging 2 meals a day, and 27.3% averaged 1 meal a day. Eighty-seven percent prepared their own meals, relying on food they bought (54.2%), help from friends and family (19.1%), and soup kitchens and food pantries (22%); 47.3% received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (food stamps). Additionally, of those who screened positive for food insecurity 19.8% had diabetes or prediabetes, and 43.5% reported hypoglycemia symptoms when without food. Clinic staff members responded positively to the screening program and described it as a good rapport builder with patients. Integrating screening for food insecurity among patients in clinical settings was well received by both patients and health care providers. Addressing these positive findings of food insecurity requires a multidisciplinary health care approach.",
  "27590051": "Generation and analyses of human synthetic antibody libraries and their application for protein microarrays Antibody -based proteomics offers distinct advantages in the analysis of complex samples for discovery and validation of biomarkers associated with disease. However, its large-scale implementation requires tools and technologies that allow development of suitable antibody or antibody fragments in a high-throughput manner. To address this we designed and constructed two human synthetic antibody fragment (scFv) libraries denoted HelL-11 and HelL-13. By the use of phage display technology, in total 466 unique scFv antibodies specific for 114 different antigens were generated. The specificities of these antibodies were analyzed in a variety of immunochemical assays and a subset was further evaluated for functionality in protein microarray applications. This high-throughput approach demonstrates the ability to rapidly generate a wealth of reagents not only for proteome research, but potentially also for diagnostics and therapeutics. In addition, this work provides a great example on how a synthetic approach can be used to optimize library designs. By having precise control of the diversity introduced into the antigen - binding sites, synthetic libraries offer increased understanding of how different diversity contributes to antibody binding reactivity and stability, thereby providing the key to future library optimization.",

However, these isolated species, especially those with sensitive life history traits, are at high risk for the adverse effects of genetic drift and habitat degradation by non-native wildlife. Here, we study the population genetic diversity, structure, and stability of a classic \" island giant \" (Xantusia riversiana, the Island Night Lizard) on San Clemente Island, California following the removal of feral goats. Using DNA microsatellites, we found that this population is reasonably genetically robust despite historical grazing, with similar effective population sizes and genetic diversity metrics across all sampling locations irrespective of habitat type and degree of degradation. However, we also found strong site-specific patterns of genetic variation and low genetic diversity compared to mainland congeners, warranting continued special management as an island endemic. We identify both high and low elevation areas that remain valuable repositories of genetic diversity and provide a case study for other low-dispersal coastal organisms in the face of future climate change.",

We previously found that fatty acid oxidation is compromised not only in these inborn errors of metabolism but also in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from all pregnancies complicated by the HELLP syndrome. Sirtuins are oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))dependent deacetylases linked to the metabolic status of the cell. SIRT 4 is known to have regulatory functions in fatty acid oxidation. The HELLP syndrome is often associated with short-term hypoxia. We studied sirtuins (SIRT 1, SIRT 3, and SIRT 4) in HUVECs from pregnancies complicated by the HELLP syndrome and uncomplicated pregnancies exposed to hypoxia (n = 7 controls, 7 HELLP; 0, 10, 60, or 120 minutes of 2% O2). Protein levels of SIRT 4 were significantly higher in HUVECs from HELLP compared to control after 60 and 120 minutes of hypoxia. The NAD(+) levels increased in a time - dependent manner.",

Each participant completed two 15-min visual search task sets at each curvature setting. The 600-mm and 1200-mm settings yielded better results than the flat setting in terms of legibility and perceived visual fatigue. Relative to the corresponding centre zone, the outermost zones of the 1200-mm and flat settings showed a decrease of 8%-37% in legibility, whereas those of the flat setting showed an increase of 26%-45% in perceived visual fatigue. Across curvature s, legibility decreased by 2%-8%, whereas perceived visual fatigue increased by 22% during the second task set. The two task sets induced an increase of 102% in the eye complaint score and a decrease of 0.3 Hz in the critical fusion frequency, both of which indicated an increase in visual fatigue. In summary, a curvature of around 600 mm, central display zones, and frequent breaks are recommended to improve legibility and reduce visual fatigue.",

We examined its potential effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) content (HDL - S1P) and HDL -mediated protection against oxidative stress, both with and without statin treatment. In a case-control study, HDL was isolated from 12 FH patients with and without statin treatment and from 12 healthy controls. The HDL - S1P content and the capacity of HDL to protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress in vitro were measured. HDL -associated S1P was significantly correlated with cell protection, but not with HDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein AI. The latter did not correlate with HDL -mediated cell protection. Neither the HDL - S1P content nor HDL protective capacity differed between nontreated FH patients and controls. The relative amounts of apolipoprotein AI and apolipoprotein M were similar between controls and FH patients. Statin treatment had no effect on any of these measures. The FH environment is not detrimental to HDL - S1P content or HDL - S1P -mediated cell protection. Statin treatment does not modulate HDL function in this regard.",

Women diagnosed with EC between 1998 and 2010 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Variables associated with the outcomes of interest were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression. Among 228,511 women identified, the percentage of blacks with stage IIIC/IV disease at diagnosis was nearly twice that of non-Hispanic whites (17.8% vs 9.8%; P<0.001). Patients with advanced disease who were insured with Medicare were less likely to receive standard-of-care postoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy than those with private insurance (odds ratio: OR 0.80, P<0.001), as were those residing in the South (reference) in comparison to the Northeast, Atlantic, Great Lakes, and Midwest regions (OR 1.3-1.7, all P<0.001). Those residing in the Mountain region were even less likely to receive appropriate treatment (OR 0.7, P<0.001). Five-year stage IIIC/IV survival was 42.8% for non-Hispanic whites vs 24.6% for blacks (hazard ratio 1.3, P<0.001). Other factors associated with inferior 5-year survival included payer status (not insured, Medicaid, Medicare, vs private, ORs 1.2-1.3, all P<0.01), and treatment at low-volume centers (<5 vs ≥30cases/year, HR 1.3, P<0.001).

  "27530243": "Drug-drug interactions of cytostatics with regular medicines in lung cancer patients Lung cancer patients have a high risk for drug-drug interactions, as they use numerous types of concomitant medicines including antineoplastic agents, cancer treatment co-medication, and medicines aimed at several types of comorbidities. The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence and the clinical relevance of the drug-drug interactions between antineoplastic agents and regular medication used by lung cancer patients. Secondary objectives are (i) to determine the effectiveness of the medication review by the hospital pharmacists concerned, (ii) to establish which patients are most at risk of drug-drug interactions and (iii) to determine whether physicians comply with advice given by hospital pharmacists. This prospective study was undertaken in a Dutch hospital pharmacy, at Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis (OLVG), Amsterdam. All lung cancer patients receiving one or more cytotoxic agents during the period 21 June 2010 till 2 December 2014 at OLVG were included. The medication list of the patients was obtained electronically from the community pharmacy and checked for interactions by a hospital pharmacist. Interactions that required intervention according to the national database were the only ones taken into account. Interventions were recorded in the patients ' electronic chart s. All medication reviews were cross-checked and analyzed by an independent pharmacist at the end of the study period. Prevalence and clinical relevance of drug-drug interactions between antineoplastic agents and other types of medication in lung cancer patients. A total of 298 lung cancer patients were included in this study. In 53 patients (18%), a total of 73 interactions with potential clinical relevance were found. The most frequent interaction was between cytostatics and coumarins while the most relevant one was between cisplatin and furosemide. According to statistical analysis, gender as well as the number of drugs prescribed were significant predictors for drug-drug interactions. Eighty-four percent of the interactions were discovered by pharmacists during daily routine. In 92% of the cases, the pulmonary physicians complied with the advice of the pharmacist. Eighteen percent of lung cancer patients treated with cytotoxic therapy had one or more relevant drug-drug interactions. This study shows that medication surveillance by a hospital pharmacist is necessary to prevent possible negative drug-drug interactions. Further research should focus on the clinical outcome of the interactions as well as on interactions between cytostatics and alternative medicines and/or over-the-counter medicines.",
  "27706190": "Influence of Different Levels of Lipoic Acid Synthase Gene Expression on Diabetic Nephropathy Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) but outcomes of many clinical trials are controversial. To define the role of antioxidants in kidney protection during the development of diabetic nephropathy, we have generated a novel genetic antioxidant mouse model with over- or under-expression of lipoic acid synthase gene (Lias). These models have been mated with Ins2Akita/+ mice, a type I diabetic mouse model. We compare the major pathologic changes and oxidative stress status in two new strains of the mice with controls. Our results show that Ins2Akita/+ mice with under-expressed Lias gene, exhibit higher oxidative stress and more severe DN features (albuminuria, glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial matrix expansion). In contrast, Ins2Akita/+ mice with highly - expressed Lias gene display lower oxidative stress and less DN pathologic changes. Our study demonstrates that strengthening endogenous antioxidant capacity could be an effective strategy for prevention and treatment of DN.",
  "28178386": "Evaluating a dignity care intervention for palliative care in the community setting: community nurses ' perspectives To evaluate a dignity care intervention provided by community nurses seeking to address dignity concerns for people with advanced and life-limiting conditions. Evidence would suggest that dying people fear a loss of dignity and a central focus of palliative care is to assist people to die with dignity. Whilst community nurses have a key role to play in the delivery of palliative care, specific interventions for dignity are lacking. A mixed methods study using online survey and focus group interviews and thematic analysis to examine data. Twenty four community nurses implemented the dignity care intervention for people with advanced and life-limiting conditions were recruited from four pilot sites across Ireland. Four focus group interviews and on line survey were conducted between March-June 2015. The community nurses found the dignity care intervention useful. It helped the nurses to provide holistic end-of-life care and assisted in the overall assessment of palliative care patients, identifying areas that might not otherwise have been noted. Whilst it was a useful tool for communication, they noted that it stimulated some emotionally sensitive conversations for which they felt unprepared. Implementing the dignity care intervention in practice was challenging. However, the dignity care intervention facilitated holistic assessment and identified patient dignity-related concerns that may not have been otherwise identified. Further support is required to overcome barriers and enable dignity-conserving care. Ensuring dignity is a key aspect of palliative and end-of-life care; however, community nurses may not feel equipped to address this aspect of care. Implementing a dignity care intervention can assist in identifying patient dignity-related concerns and provision of holistic care. Community nurses need more training to assist in difficult conversations relating to dignity and end-of-life care.",

A diagnosis of PNSC was made in 17.6% of all patients referred during the 15-month study period. Cohorts with psychogenic nonsyncopal collapse (n=40) and PNES (n=40) did not differ in age (15.5±2.2 versus 14.6±2.7, p=.11) or female gender (80% versus 72.5%, p=.43). Psychogenic nonsyncopal collapse events were briefer than PNES events (median: 45 versus 201.5s, p<.001). Negative motor signs (head drop, body limpness) predominated in PNSC (85% versus 20%, p<.001), while the positive motor signs of convulsion occurred more often with PNES (90% versus 30%, p<.001). Behavioral arrest (25% versus 32.5%, p=.46) and eye closure (85% versus 72.5%, p=.21) did not differ between PNSC and PNES. Patients with PNSC were more likely to be tearful before (30% versus 7.5%, p=.02) and after (62.5% versus 7.5%, p<.001) an event. In conclusion, although overlap exists, the features of PNSC generally appear similar to neurally mediated syncope, while the features of PNES generally appear similar to epileptic seizures. Psychogenic nonsyncopal collapse and PNES likely represent similar disorders that differ primarily by clinical semiologies and referral patterns.",
  "27818989": "SimAlba: A Spatial Microsimulation Approach to the Analysis of Health Inequalities This paper presents applied geographical research based on a spatial microsimulation model, SimAlba, aimed at estimating geographically sensitive health variables in Scotland. SimAlba has been developed in order to answer a variety of \" what-if\" policy questions pertaining to health policy in Scotland. Using the SimAlba model, it is possible to simulate the distributions of previously unknown variables at the small area level such as smoking, alcohol consumption, mental well-being, and obesity. The SimAlba microdataset has been created by combining Scottish Health Survey and Census data using a deterministic reweighting spatial microsimulation algorithm developed for this purpose. The paper presents SimAlba outputs for Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, and examines the spatial distribution of the simulated variables for small geographical areas in Glasgow as well as the effects on individuals of different policy scenario outcomes. In simulating previously unknown spatial data, a wealth of new perspectives can be examined and explored. This paper explores a small set of those potential avenues of research and shows the power of spatial microsimulation modeling in an urban context.",
  "28285800": "Perspectives on cardiovascular effects of incretin -based drugs: From bedside to bench, return trip Recently, cardiovascular outcome trials with glucose -lowering drugs used in type 2 diabetes mellitus, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), liraglutide and semaglutide, showed a reduction in cardiovascular events, which had not been observed in trials with other incretin -based drugs, such as lixisenatide or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i). Mechanisms underlying the observed cardiovascular differences between DPP4i and GLP1-RA, and across individual GLP1-RA are poorly understood. This review is aimed at collecting and summarizing available evidence from experimental and mechanistic studies on the action of GLP1-RA and DPP4i on the cardiovascular system, both deriving from clinical and pre-clinical sources. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials are interpreted on the basis of the experimental preclinical data available, paying particular attention to the heart failure results, and suggesting some novel intriguing hypotheses to explain some of the unexpected findings of cardioprotection of incretin -based drugs. In particular, we discuss the possible contribution to the incretin cardiovascular effects of a direct cardiac action of GLP-1 metabolites through GLP-1 receptor -independent pathways, and of DPP4 substrates other than GLP-1.",

Our aim was to study the methylation landscape in placenta DNA from trisomy 13, 18 and 21 pregnancies in an attempt to find trisomy -specific methylation differences better suited for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. We have conducted high-resolution methylation specific bead chip microarray analyses assessing more than 450,000 CpGs analyzing placentas from 12 T21 pregnancies, 12 T18 pregnancies and 6 T13 pregnancies. We have compared the methylation landscape of the trisomic placentas to the methylation landscape from normal placental DNA and to maternal blood cell DNA. Comparing trisomic placentas to normal placentas we identified 217 and 219 differentially methylated CpGs for CVS T18 and CVS T13, respectively (delta β>0.2, FDR<0.05), but only three differentially methylated CpGs for T21. However, the methylation differences was only modest (delta β<0.4), making them less suitable as diagnostic markers. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the gene set connected to the T18 differentially methylated CpGs was highly enriched for GO terms related to\" DNA binding \" and \" transcription factor binding \" coupled to the RNA polymerase II transcription. In the gene set connected to the T13 differentially methylated CpGs we found no significant enrichments.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of an intraoperative goal-directed fluid restriction (GDFR) strategy on the postoperative outcome of high - risk patients undergoing brain surgery. High - risk patients undergoing brain surgery were randomly assigned to a usual care group (control group) or a GDFR group. In the GDFR group, (1) fluid maintenance was restricted to 3 ml/kg/h of a crystalloid solution and (2) colloid boluses were allowed only in case of hypotension associated with a low cardiac index and a high stroke volume variation. The primary outcome variable was ICU length of stay, and secondary outcomes were lactates at the end of surgery, postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, mortality at day 30, and costs. A total of 73 patients from the GDFR group were compared with 72 patients from the control group. Before surgery, the two groups were comparable. During surgery, the GDFR group received less colloid (1.9 ± 1.1 vs. 3.9 ± 1.6 ml/kg/h, p = 0.021) and less crystalloid (3 ± 0 vs. 5.0 ± 2.8 ml/kg/h, p < 0.001) than the control group. ICU length of stay was shorter (3 days [1-5] vs. 6 days [3-11], p = 0.001) and ICU costs were lower in the GDFR group. The total number of complications (46 vs. 99, p = 0.043) and the proportion of patients who developed one or more complications (19.2 vs. 34.7%, p = 0.034) were smaller in the GDFR group. Hospital length of stay and costs, as well as mortality at 30 day, were not significantly reduced. In high - risk patients undergoing brain surgery, intraoperative GDFR was associated with a reduction in ICU length of stay and costs, and a decrease in postoperative morbidity.

  "27598421": "Culex quinquefasciatus from Rio de Janeiro Is Not Competent to Transmit the Local Zika Virus The Americas have suffered a dramatic epidemic of Zika since May in 2015, when Zika virus (ZIKV) was first detected in Brazil. Mosquitoes belonging to subgenus Stegomyia of Aedes, particularly Aedes aegypti, are considered the primary vectors of ZIKV. However, the rapid spread of the virus across the continent raised several concerns about the transmission dynamics, especially about potential mosquito vectors. The purpose of this work was to assess the vector competence of the house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus from an epidemic Zika area, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for local circulating ZIKV isolates. Culex quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti (positive control of ZIKV infection) from Rio de Janeiro were orally exposed to two ZIKV strains isolated from human cases from Rio de Janeiro (Rio-U1 and Rio-S1). Fully engorged mosquitoes were held in incubators at 26 ± 1°C, 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle and 70 ± 10% humidity. For each combination mosquito population- ZIKV strain, 30 specimens were examined for infection, dissemination and transmission rates, at 7, 14 and 21 days after virus exposure by analyzing body (thorax plus abdomen), head and saliva respectively. Infection rates were minimal to completely absent in all Cx. quinquefasciatus - virus combinations and were significantly high for Ae. aegypti. Moreover, dissemination and transmission were not detected in any Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes whatever the incubation period and the ZIKV isolate. In contrast, Ae. aegypti ensured high viral dissemination and moderate to very high transmission. The southern house mosquito Cx. quinquefasciatus from Rio de Janeiro was not competent to transmit local strains of ZIKV. Thus, there is no experimental evidence that Cx. quinquefasciatus likely plays a role in the ZIKV transmission. Consequently, at least in Rio, mosquito control to reduce ZIKV transmission should remain focused on Ae. aegypti.",
  "28344199": "Association of Toll-Like Receptor 4 on Human Monocyte Subsets and Vulnerability Characteristics of Coronary Plaque as Assessed by 64-Slice Multidetector Computed Tomography Although Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is involved in monocyte activation in patients with accelerated forms of atherosclerosis, the relationship between the expression of TLR-4 on circulating monocyte s and coronary plaque vulnerability has not previously been evaluated. We investigated this relationship using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP).Methods and Results:We enrolled 65 patients with SAP who underwent MDCT. Three monocyte subsets (CD14(++)CD16(-), CD14(++)CD16(+), and CD14(+)CD16(+)) and expression of TLR-4 were measured by flow cytometry. Intracoronary plaques were assessed by 64-slice MDCT. We defined vulnerability of intracoronary plaques according to the presence of positive remodeling (remodeling index >1.05) and/or low CT attenuation (<35 HU). The circulating CD14(++)CD16(+)monocytes more frequently expressed TLR-4 than CD14(++)CD16(-) and CD14(+)CD16(+)monocytes (P<0.001). The relative proportion of the expression of TLR-4 on CD14(++)CD16(+)monocytes was significantly greater in patients with vulnerable plaque compared with those without (10.4 [4.1-14.5] % vs. 4.5 [2.8-7.8] %, P=0.012). In addition, the relative proportion of TLR-4 expression on CD14(++)CD16(+)monocytes positively correlated with the remodeling index (r=0.28, P=0.025) and negatively correlated with CT attenuation value (r=-0.31, P=0.013). Upregulation of TLR-4 on CD14(++)CD16(+)monocytes might be associated with coronary plaque vulnerability in patients with SAP.",
  "27717775": "The Effect of l-Arginine on Dural Healing After Experimentally Induced Dural Defect in a Rat Model Incomplete repair of the dura mater may result in numerous complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis. For this reason, accurate repair of the dura mater is essential. In this study, the effect of systemic and local supplementation of l-arginine on dural healing was evaluated. Thirty male Wistar rats were used and divided into control, local, and systemic l-arginine groups, with 10 rats in each. In each group, a 5-mm experimental incision was made at the lumbar segment of the dura mater and cerebrospinal fluid leakage was induced. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups and at the end of the first and sixth weeks, the rats were killed and the damaged segments of the dura were separated, histologically evaluated and the dural healing indicators including cell types, granulation tissue formation, collagen deposit, and vascularization were compared between groups. The systematic supplementation of l-arginine showed a significant effect in dural healing compared with the control group. After the first week, granulation formation increased considerably (P < 0.031), and after 6 weeks, collagen deposition and neovascularization were significantly different compared with the control group (P < 0.030; P < 0.009). In comparison between different groups at the end of the first and sixth weeks, maximum changes in healing indicators were observed in the systemic group and the least variations were related to the control group. The systemic supplementation of l-arginine may accelerate dural healing by increasing the level of granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and vascularization.",

Alongside evidence that the condition is heritable, mutations in single genes have been reported in few human supernumerary tooth cases. Gene sequencing methods in tradition way are time-consuming and labor-intensive, whereas next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics are cost-effective for large samples and target sizes. We describe the application of a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics approach to samples from 17 mesiodens patients. Subjects were diagnosed on the basis of panoramic radiograph. A total of 101 candidate genes which were captured custom genes were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Multistep bioinformatics processing was performed including variant identification, base calling, and in silico analysis of putative disease - causing variants. Targeted capture identified 88 non-synonymous, rare, exonic variants involving 42 of the 101 candidate genes. Moreover, we investigated gene co-occurrence relationships between the genomic alterations and identified 88 significant relationships among 18 most recurrent driver alterations. Our search for co-occurring genetic alterations revealed that such alterations interact cooperatively to drive mesiodens. We discovered a gene co-occurrence network in mesiodens patients with functionally enriched gene groups in the sonic hedgehog (SHH), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), and wingless integrated (WNT) signaling pathways.",
  "27799920": "Genetic Identification of a PilT Motor in Geobacter sulfurreducens Reveals a Role for Pilus Retraction in Extracellular Electron Transfer The metal - reducing bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens requires the expression of conductive pili to reduce iron oxides and to wire electroactive biofilms, but the role of pilus retraction in these functions has remained elusive. Here we show that of the four PilT proteins encoded in the genome of G. sulfurreducens, PilT3 powered pilus retraction in planktonic cells of a PilT - deficient strain of P. aeruginosa and restored the dense mutant biofilms to wild-type levels. Furthermore, PilT3 and PilT4 rescued the twitching motility defect of the PilT - deficient mutant. However, PilT4 was the only paralog whose inactivation in G. sulfurreducens lead to phenotypes associated with the hyperpiliation of non-retractile mutants such as enhanced adhesion and biofilm-forming abilities. In addition, PilT4 was required to reduce iron oxides. Taken together, the results indicate that PilT4 is the motor ATPase of G. sulfurreducens pili and reveal a previously unrecognized role for pilus retraction in extracellular electron transfer, a strategy that confers on Geobacter spp. an adaptive advantage for metal reduction in the natural environment.",

With Ethics committee approval, 1000 consecutive patients seen before elective surgery in the anaesthesia preoperative clinic of a Swiss Level 2 hospital were asked to complete a questionnaire. Primary outcome were patients using the internet to gather any medical information related to their upcoming hospital stay, secondary outcome patients using the internet to gather information regarding the upcoming anaesthesia. Multiple regression was performed to identify independent factors associated with internet use. Eighty-two percent of the patients (n = 815) participated. 97% of those were ASA physical status 1 or 2; 83% (n = 676) had experience with previous anaesthetics, 86% (n = 700) reported to use the internet in general. Overall, about one-third of the participants used the internet to learn more about their medical condition, 26% regarding their upcoming surgical procedure. Only 7% (n = 55) obtained information about the anaesthetic. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with internet use were generally doing so, and planned moderate compared to minor surgery; not using the internet was associated with previous anaesthetic experience. Of those who did not use the Internet to learn about their anaesthetic, 34% indicated that they would have visited a trusted website. Only few patients used the internet to obtain information about their upcoming procedure and the anaesthetic part played an even smaller role.

To evaluate the frequency of TERT promoter (TERTp), BRAF and NRAS mutations in metastatic thyroid carcinomas, analyzing primary thyroid tumors, lymph node metastases (LNM) and distant metastases. Mutation analysis was performed in 437 tissue samples from 204 patients, mainly with papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) (n=180), including 196 LNM and 56 distant metastases. All the distant metastases included corresponded to radioiodine -refractory metastatic tissue. We found the following mutation frequency in primary PTC, LNM and distant metastases, respectively: TERTp - 12.9%, 10.5%, and 52.4%; BRAF - 44.6%, 41.7%, and 23.8%; NRAS - 1.2%, 1.3%, and 14.3%. There was a significant concordance between the primary tumor genotype and the corresponding LNM for all the genes, in particular BRAF -mutated PTC. The overall concordance between primary tumors and respective distant metastases was low. In the group of patients with PTC, we found a high frequency of TERTp mutations and a low frequency of BRAF mutations in distant metastases, in comparison to the paired primary tumors. When present in distant metastases, BRAF mutations frequently coexisted with TERTp mutations. When the genotype of primary tumors is compared with the genotype of LNM, the concordance is high for all the genes studied. On the other hand, distant metastases show an enrichment in TERTp mutations and a decrease in BRAF mutations. TERTp mutations may play a role in distant metastases.",

The authors hypothesize that hydrofiber dressings will hold mafenide acetate solution for an extended period of time and maintain antimicrobial activity longer than traditional gauze, thus possibly obviating the need for frequent dressing changes. Four experimental arms included: 1) hydrofiber, stored on a dry well plate as control, 2) gauze saturated with 2.5% mafenide acetate, stored on nonsterile porcine skin, 3) hydrofiber saturated with mafenide acetate, stored on dry well plate, and 4) hydrofiber saturated with mafenide acetate, stored on nonsterile porcine skin. At 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours, a 1-cm disk was cut from the dressing sheet of each study arm, placed on agar plates seeded with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and incubated for 24 hours, and the zone of inhibition was measured. A zone of 2 mm or greater was indicative of susceptibility. Each arm of the experiment was performed four times to demonstrate reproducibility. Plain hydrofiber (control) demonstrated no zone of inhibition at any time point, thereby possessing no antimicrobial activity alone. Gauze saturated with mafenide acetate did not reliably demonstrate antimicrobial activity beyond 0 hours. Hydrofiber saturated with mafenide acetate, whether stored on a dry well plate or nonsterile porcine skin, consistently possessed sustained antimicrobial activity as demonstrated by zones of inhibition greater than 2 mm to both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.

The purpose of the majority of such noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) remained paradoxical for a long time. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that long noncoding RNAs are dynamically expressed in different cell types, diseases, or developmental stages to execute a wide variety of regulatory roles at virtually every step of gene expression and translation. Indeed, long noncoding RNAs influence gene expression via epigenetic modulations, through regulating alternative splicing, or by acting as molecular sponges. The abundance of long noncoding RNAs in the cardiovascular system indicates that they may be part of a complex regulatory network governing physiology and pathology of the heart. In this review, we discuss the multifaceted functions of long noncoding RNAs and highlight the current literature with an emphasis on cardiac development and disease. Furthermore, as the enormous spectrum of long noncoding RNAs potentially opens up new avenues for diagnosis and prevention of heart failure, we ultimately evaluate the futuristic prospects of long noncoding RNAs as biomarkers, and therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, as well.",

Historically, there have been different opinions on the optimal patch test concentration of MCI/MI, and both 0.01% and 0.02% aqueous (aq.) have been proposed. In 2011, based on literature reviews, it was recommended that the concentration of 0.02% aq. should be used in the international baseline series. The aim of this study was to verify the recommendation from 2011 by comparing the patch test results from consecutive patch testing with MCI/MI 0.01% and 0.02% in clinics representing countries around the world. Two thousand seven hundred three consecutive patients with dermatitis in 8 dermatology clinics representing 8 countries were patch tested with MCI/MI 0.01% aq. and, in parallel with MCI/MI 0.02% aq., provisionally included in the baseline series. Contact allergy to MCI/MI at 0.01% and 0.02% was found in 3.7% and 5.6% of the patients, respectively (P < 0.001). Methylchloroisothiazolinone/MI 0.02% aq.

Importantly, even though the immune system of newborns may be characterized as developmentally immature, with a propensity to develop Th2 immunity, significant CD8+ T-cell responses may still be elicited in the context of optimal priming. Replication deficient adenoviral vectors have been demonstrated to induce potent CD8+ T-cell response in mice, primates and humans. The aim of the present study was therefore to assess whether replication-deficient adenovectors could overcome the risk of overwhelming antigen stimulation during the first period of life and provide a pertinent alternative in infant vaccinology. To address this, infant mice were vaccinated with three different adenoviral vectors and the CD8+ T-cell response after early life vaccination was explored. We assessed the frequency, polyfunctionality and in vivo cytotoxicity of the elicited memory CD8+ T cells, as well as the potential of these cells to respond to secondary infections and confer protection. We further tested the impact of maternal immunity against our replication-deficient adenoviral vector during early life vaccination. Overall, our results indicate that memory CD8+ T cells induced by adenoviral vectors in infant mice are of good quality and match those elicited in the adult host.",

This study examined the nature and severity of voice disorders in patients with SGS before and after a revised cricotracheal resection (CTR) procedure designed to minimize adverse effects on voice function. Eleven women with idiopathic SGS provided presurgical and postsurgical audio recordings. Voice Handicap Index (VHI) scores were also collected. Cepstral, signal-to-noise, periodicity, and fundamental frequency (F0) analyses were undertaken for connected speech and sustained vowel samples. Listeners made auditory - perceptual ratings of overall quality and monotonicity. Paired samples statistical analyses revealed that mean F0 decreased from 215 Hz (standard deviation [SD] = 40 Hz) to 201 Hz (SD = 65 Hz) following surgery. In general, VHI scores decreased after surgery. Voice disorder severity based on the Cepstral Spectral Index of Dysphonia (KayPentax, Montvale, NJ) for sustained vowels decreased (improved) from 41 (SD = 41) to 25 (SD = 21) points; no change was observed for connected speech. Semitone SD (2.2 semitones) did not change from pre- to posttreatment. Auditory - perceptual ratings demonstrated similar results. These preliminary results indicate that this revised CTR procedure is promising in minimizing adverse voice effects while offering a longer-term surgical outcome for SGS.

These lesions are often considered as pulmonary metastases and increasingly treated by non-surgical techniques without histological confirmation. The aim of this study is to determine the histological nature of SPN resected by thoracoscopy and to identify risk factors of malignancy. Single-institution retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with previously known malignancies who underwent thoracoscopic resection of SPN with unknown diagnosis between 2001 and 2014. One hundred and forty cancer patients underwent thoracoscopic resection of a SPN. The resected SPN was benign in 34 patients (24.3%) and malignant in 106 patients. The latter were metastasis in 70 patients (50%) and a primary lung cancer in 36 patients (25.7%). Upon univariate analysis, malignancy was significantly associated with age >60 years, disease -free interval ≥24 months, SPN size >8 mm, upper lobe localization and SUVmax > 2.5 on PET-CT. Upon multivariate analysis, upper lobe localization and SUVmax > 2.5 were associated with malignancy. Smoking was significantly associated with SPN containing primary lung cancer. In this series, only 50% of SPN in patients with known malignant disease were pulmonary metastases and 25% had a newly diagnosed NSCLC. Smoking was associated with primary lung cancer but no other predictor was found to allow the distinction between pulmonary metastasis and lung cancer. These results endorse the need of histological confirmation of SPN in patients with previous malignancies to avoid diagnostic uncertainty and suboptimal treatments.",

  "28158248": "Modeling the flux of metabolites in the juvenile hormone biosynthesis pathway using generalized additive models and ordinary differential equations Juvenile hormone (JH) regulates development and reproductive maturation in insects. The corpora allata (CA) from female adult mosquitoes synthesize fluctuating levels of JH, which have been linked to the ovarian development and are influenced by nutritional signals. The rate of JH biosynthesis is controlled by the rate of flux of isoprenoids in the pathway, which is the outcome of a complex interplay of changes in precursor pools and enzyme levels. A comprehensive study of the changes in enzymatic activities and precursor pool sizes have been previously reported for the mosquito Aedes aegypti JH biosynthesis pathway. In the present studies, we used two different quantitative approaches to describe and predict how changes in the individual metabolic reactions in the pathway affect JH synthesis. First, we constructed generalized additive models (GAMs) that described the association between changes in specific metabolite concentrations with changes in enzymatic activities and substrate concentrations. Changes in substrate concentrations explained 50% or more of the model deviances in 7 of the 13 metabolic steps analyzed. Addition of information on enzymatic activities almost always improved the fitness of GAMs built solely based on substrate concentrations. GAMs were validated using experimental data that were not included when the model was built. In addition, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) was developed to describe the instantaneous changes in metabolites as a function of the levels of enzymatic catalytic activities. The results demonstrated the ability of the models to predict changes in the flux of metabolites in the JH pathway, and can be used in the future to design and validate experimental manipulations of JH synthesis.",
  "27669322": "The Peptidoglycan Pattern of Staphylococcus carnosus TM300 - Detailed Analysis and Variations Due to Genetic and Metabolic Influences The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus carnosus (S. carnosus) TM300 is an apathogenic staphylococcal species commonly used in meat starter cultures. As with all Gram-positive bacteria, its cytoplasmic membrane is surrounded by a thick peptidoglycan (PGN) or murein sacculus consisting of several layers of glycan strands cross-linked by peptides. In contrast to pathogenic staphylococci, mainly Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), the chemical composition of S. carnosus PGN is not well studied so far. UPLC/MS analysis of enzymatically digested S. carnosus TM300 PGN revealed substantial differences in its composition compared to the known pattern of S. aureus. While in S. aureus the uncross-linked stem peptide consists of a pentapeptide, in S. carnosus, this part of the PGN is shortened to tripeptides. Furthermore, we found the PGN composition to vary when cells were incubated under certain conditions. The collective overproduction of HlyD, FtsE and FtsX -a putative protein complex interacting with penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2)-caused the reappearance of classical penta stem peptides. In addition, under high sugar conditions, tetra stem peptides occur due to overflow metabolism. This indicates that S. carnosus TM300 cells adapt to various conditions by modification of their PGN.",
  "27644855": "Assessment of groundwater vulnerability in the Daule aquifer, Ecuador, using the susceptibility index method The Guayas region in Ecuador is economically very important, producing 68% of the national crops. The main agricultural activities threaten the groundwater therein with nitrate contamination given the large fertiliser and water needs. The present work tests the applicability of the susceptibility index assessment method in evaluating the impact of agricultural activities on groundwater quality, using as a case study an aquifer of the Guayas river basin in Ecuador. The index adapts four parameters of the DRASTIC method and incorporated a new land use parameter. Results show that the areas highly vulnerable to contamination are located in irrigation perimeters of dominant paddy fields associated with the high recharge rates in the alluvial deposits. Respectively, moderately vulnerable and low - vulnerability areas correspond to aquatic environments and forests, semi-natural zones and water bodies. One of the main contributions of the Daule aquifer vulnerability is likely its wide, flat topography. A great part of the aquifer is at high risk of contamination by nitrates if a code of good agricultural practices is not applied. Therefore the implementation of a monitoring network to control the nitrates concentrations is the first step to assure groundwater quality for drinking purposes.",
  "27638646": "Evaluation of Cardiac Toxicity Biomarkers in Rats from Different Laboratories There is a great need for improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of potential cardiac toxicity in drug development. This study reports the evaluation of several commercially available biomarker kits by 3 institutions (SRI, Eli Lilly, and Pfizer) for the discrimination between myocardial degeneration / necrosis and cardiac hypertrophy as well as the assessment of the interlaboratory and interplatform variation in results. Serum concentrations of natriuretic peptides (N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide [NT-proANP] and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]), cardiac and skeletal troponins (cTnI, cTnT, and sTnI), myosin light chain 3 (Myl3), and fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3) were assessed in rats treated with minoxidil (MNX) and isoproterenol (ISO). MNX caused increased heart -to- body weight ratios and prominent elevations in NT-proANP and NT-proBNP concentrations detected at 24-hr postdose without elevation in troponins, Myl3, or FABP3 and with no abnormal histopathological findings. ISO caused ventricular leukocyte infiltration, myocyte fibrosis, and necrosis with increased concentrations of the natriuretic peptides, cardiac troponins, and Myl3. These results reinforce the advantages of a multimarker strategy in elucidating the underlying cause of cardiac insult and detecting myocardial tissue damage at 24-hr posttreatment. The interlaboratory and interplatform comparison analyses also showed that the data obtained from different laboratories and platforms are highly correlated and reproducible, making these biomarkers widely applicable in preclinical studies.",
  "27922526": "Air Pollutant Exposure Within a Few Days of Delivery and Placental Abruption in Japan Placental abruption is an emergency obstetric complication. Although the etiology of abruption is not fully understood, acute stimuli, such as ischemia and/or inflammation, are associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in placental separation. Ischemia and inflammation are acute biologic effects of air pollution. Using a case-crossover design, we tested the hypothesis that a short-term increase in exposure to air pollutants is a potential trigger of placental abruption. We received data for western Japan (Kyushu-Okinawa Districts) from the Japan Perinatal Registry Network database. From 2005 to 2010, 821 singleton pregnant women with placental abruption were identified. We assigned daily concentrations of air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), suspended particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide (SO2), from the nearest monitoring station to the respective delivery hospital of each woman. Because information on the onset day of abruption was not obtained, we assumed the case day to be 1 day before the day of delivery. Exposure to NO2 at 2 days' lag was associated with placental abruption (temperature adjusted odds ratio per 10 ppb increase = 1.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 1.8). The association patterns were similar, when we restricted to participants who delivered by emergency cesarean (1.4, 1.1, 1.9), or who delivered after 35 weeks of gestation (1.4, 1.0, 2.0). There was no association with suspended particulate matter, ozone, or SO2. We observed an association between NO2 exposure at 2 days before the day of delivery and placental abruption in pregnant Japanese women.",
  "28179361": "A microbial signature for Crohn's disease A decade of microbiome studies has linked IBD to an alteration in the gut microbial community of genetically predisposed subjects. However, existing profiles of gut microbiome dysbiosis in adult IBD patients are inconsistent among published studies, and did not allow the identification of microbial signatures for CD and UC. Here, we aimed to compare the faecal microbiome of CD with patients having UC and with non - IBD subjects in a longitudinal study. We analysed a cohort of 2045 non - IBD and IBD faecal samples from four countries (Spain, Belgium, the UK and Germany), applied a 16S rRNA sequencing approach and analysed a total dataset of 115 million sequences. In the Spanish cohort, dysbiosis was found significantly greater in patients with CD than with UC, as shown by a more reduced diversity, a less stable microbial community and eight microbial groups were proposed as a specific microbial signature for CD. Tested against the whole cohort, the signature achieved an overall sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 94%, 94%, 89% and 91% for the detection of CD versus healthy controls, patients with anorexia, IBS and UC, respectively. Although UC and CD share many epidemiologic, immunologic, therapeutic and clinical features, our results showed that they are two distinct subtypes of IBD at the microbiome level. For the first time, we are proposing microbiomarkers to discriminate between CD and non - CD independently of geographical regions.",
  "28361230": "Acute kidney injury and fluid overload in infants and children after cardiac surgery Acute kidney injury is a common and serious complication after congenital heart surgery, particularly among infants. This comorbidity has been independently associated with adverse outcomes including an increase in mortality. Postoperative acute kidney injury has a complex pathophysiology with many risk factors, and therefore no single medication or therapy has been demonstrated to be effective for treatment or prevention. However, it has been established that the associated fluid overload is one of the major determinants of morbidity, particularly in infants after cardiac surgery. Therefore, in the absence of an intervention to prevent acute kidney injury, much of the effort to improve outcomes has focused on treating and preventing fluid overload. Early renal replacement therapy, often in the form of peritoneal dialysis, has been shown to be safe and beneficial in infants with oliguria after heart surgery. As understanding of the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury and the ability to confidently diagnose it earlier continues to evolve, it is likely that novel preventative and therapeutic interventions will be available in the future.",
  "27802570": "Overall Quality Properties of Kiwifruit Treated by Cinnamaldehyde and Citral: Microbial, Antioxidant Capacity during Cold Storage This work was undertaken to evaluate the microbiological characteristics and antioxidant and physiological activities in kiwifruits (Actinida deliciosa var. Qinmei) with/without cinnamaldehyde (C1) and citral (C2) fumigation treatments (5 μL/L) during 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 d of storage at 4 °C. Essential oils (EOs) treatment lowered the total viable counts, yeast, and mold to 1.54, 2.36, and 2.05 log CFU/g, respectively. Moreover, EOs improved the antioxidant activities of kiwifruit. They enhanced phenolics and flavonoids content in fruit tissue by 49.48% at day 3 and 56.93% at day 6, respectively. In addition, ascorbic acid in treated groups had the lower losing rate. Similarly, MDA (malondialdehyde), H2 O2 (hydrogen peroxide), and (•) O2(-) (superoxide anion) production were effectively decreased in the range of 27.27% to 54.38%. Physicochemical characteristics showed that kiwifruits from treated group maintained higher levels of flesh luminosity and firmness. EOs also decreased the levels of reducing sugar by 45.97% at day 3, and increased the content of soluble protein and hydrolyzed amino acid. Therefore, postharvest EOs treatment has positive effects on delaying senescence and enhancing antioxidant capacities in kiwifruit.",
  "28213659": "Profiles of mental health care professionals based on work role performance The worldwide burden of mental disorders is considerable, and on the rise, putting pressure on health care systems. Current reforms aim to improve the efficiency of mental health care systems by increasing service integration in communities and strengthening primary mental health care. In this context, mental health care professionals (MHPs) are increasingly required to work on interdisciplinary teams in a variety of settings. Little is known, however, about the profiles of MHPs in relation to their perceived work role performance. MHPs in Quebec (N = 315) from four local service networks completed a self-administered questionnaire eliciting information on individual and team characteristics, as well as team processes and states. Profiles of MHPs were created using a two-step cluster analysis. Five profiles were generated. MHPs belonging to profiles labelled senior medical outpatient specialized care MHPs and senior psychosocial outpatient specialized care MHPs perceived themselves as more performing than MHPs in other profiles. The profile labelled low-collaborators was significantly less performing than all other groups. Two other profiles were identified, positioned between the aforementioned groups in terms of the perceived performance of MHPs: the junior primary care MHPs and the diversified specialized care MHPs. Seniority within the team, delivering specialized type of care, and positive team processes were all features associated with profiles where perceived work performance was high. Overall, this study supports the case for initiatives aimed at improving stability and interdisciplinary collaboration in health teams, especially in primary care.",

The aim of this study is the evaluation of hospitalizations due to HPV-related pathologies in 2001-12 in Italy. The national hospital discharge forms were provided by the Ministry of Health. The HPV -related hospitalizations were identified using specific diagnostic codes, accordingly to the ICD-9-CM coding system. The proportion of hospitalizations of potentially HPV-related pathologies, obtained from the literature, was evaluated as well as the hospitalization rates (hr) and their trend over time. Uterine cervical cancer and CIN III accounted for 40% of hospitalizations (hr: 15.6/100 000 and 17.6/100 000, respectively). Head / neck and oropharynx pathologies accounted for 24.5% of cases (hr: 16/100 000 and 3.9/100 000, in males and females, respectively), followed by genital warts (17.3% of hospitalizations; hr: 7.5/100 000 in males and 8.52/100 000 in females), anal (8.1% of hospitalizations), genitourinary (7.7%) and penis cancers (2.2%). The study, even if limited to the evaluation of hospitalizations, points out how HPV-related pathologies continue to be a relevant public health issue in Italy with a high impact on population.",

The purpose of creating FLASHE was to enable the examination of physical activity, diet, and other cancer preventive behaviors and potential correlates among parent - adolescent dyads. FLASHE surveys were developed from a process involving literature reviews, scientific input from experts in the field, cognitive testing, and usability testing. This cross-sectional, web-based study of parents and their adolescent children (aged 12-17 years) was administered between April and October 2014. The nationwide sample consisted of 1,573 parent - adolescent dyads (1,699 parents and 1,581 adolescents) who returned all FLASHE surveys. FLASHE assessed parent and adolescent reports of several intrapersonal and interpersonal domains (including psychosocial variables, parenting, and the community and home environments). On a subset of example FLASHE items across these domains, responses of parents and adolescents within the same dyads were positively and significantly correlated (r =0.32-0.63). Analyses were run in 2015-2016. FLASHE data present multiple opportunities for studying research questions among individuals or dyads, including the ability to examine similarity between parents and adolescents on many constructs relevant to cancer preventive behaviors. FLASHE data are publicly available for researchers and practitioners to help advance research on cancer preventive health behaviors.",

Acute kinematic and kinetic adaptations to wearable resistance during sprint acceleration. J Strength Cond Res 31(5): 1297-1304, 2017- Wearable resistance (WR) in the form of weighted vests and shorts enables movement-specific sprint running to be performed under load. The purpose of this study was to determine the acute changes in kinematics and kinetics when an additional load equivalent to 3% body mass (BM) was attached to the anterior or posterior surface of the lower limbs during sprint running. Nineteen male rugby athletes (age: 19.7 ± 2.3 years; body mass: 96.1 ± 16.5 kg; height: 181 ± 6.5 cm) volunteered to participate in the study. Subjects performed six 20 m sprints in a randomized fashion wearing no resistance or 3% BM affixed to the anterior (quadriceps and tibialis anterior) or posterior (hamstring and gastrocnemius) surface of the lower limbs (2 sprints per condition). Optojump and radar were used to quantify sprint times, horizontal velocity, contact and flight times, and step length and frequency. A repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc contrasts was used to determine differences (p ≤ 0.05) between conditions. No significant differences were found between the anterior and posterior WR conditions in any of the variables of interest. There was no significant change in sprint times over the initial 10 m, however, the 10-20 m split times were significantly slower (-2.2 to -2.9%) for the WR conditions compared with the unloaded sprints. A significant change in the relative force-velocity (F-v) slope (-10.5 to -10.9%) and theoretical maximum velocity (V0) (-5.4 to -6.5%) was found, whereas a nonsignificant increase in theoretical maximum force (F0) (4.9-5.2%) occurred. Wearable resistance of 3% BM may be a suitable training modality to enhance sprint acceleration performance by overloading the athlete without negatively affecting sprint running technique.",
  "27568025": "Foliar uptake of fog in coastal California shrub species Understanding plant water uptake is important in ecosystems that experience periodic drought. In many Mediterranean -type climates like coastal California, plants are subject to significant drought and wildfire disturbance. During the dry summer months, coastal shrub species are often exposed to leaf wetting from overnight fog events. This study sought to determine whether foliar uptake of fog occurs in shrub species and how this uptake affects physiology and fuel condition. In a controlled greenhouse experiment, dominant California shrub species were exposed to isotopically labeled fog water and plant responses were measured. Potted plants were covered at the base to prevent root uptake. The deuterium label was detected in the leaves of four out of five species and in the stems of two of the species. While there was a minimal effect of foliar water uptake on live fuel moisture, several species had lower xylem tension and greater photosynthetic rates after overnight fog treatments, especially Salvia leucophylla. Coastal fog may provide a moisture source for many species during the summer drought, but the utilization of this water source may vary based on foliar morphology, phenology and plant water balance. From this study, it appears that drought -deciduous species (Artemisia californica and Salvia leucophylla) benefit more from overnight fog events than evergreen species (Adenostoma fasciculatum, Baccharis pilularis and Ceanothus megacarpus). This differential response to fog exposure among California shrub species may affect species distributions and physiological tolerances under future climate scenarios.",
  "27755951": "Construction of recombinant adenovirus Ad-rat PLCγ2 and its effects on apoptosis of rat liver cell BRL-3A in vitro Although the role of PLCγ2 in apoptotic response has been reported, too little is known about whether PLCγ2 induces liver cell apoptosis during liver regeneration. Therefore, this study firstly packaged Ad-PLCγ2 recombinant adenovirus and primarily evaluated its effect on apoptosis of rat liver cell BRL-3A in vitro. Following ten days of co-transfection of pHBAd-MCMV-GFP-PLCγ2 and pHBAd-BHG into HEK293 cells, viral cytopathic effect (CPE) was apparent. Following three rounds of amplification, tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay showed that the titer value reached 1×1010 PFU/mL. After 24 h of transfection of recombinant adenovirus into BRL-3A cells, transfection efficiency of adenovirus into BRL-3A cells was above 90% when obsereved under fluorescent microscopy. qRT-PCR and Western blot assays showed mRNA and protein levels of PLCγ2 were significantly elevated in the transfected BRL-3A cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that, compared with the control and Ad-GFP groups, cell apoptosis rate of Ad-PLCγ2 group were significantly increased (P<0.01), and the cell cycle in Ad-PLCγ2 group was arrested at G1 phase which was manifested by a marked increase (P<0.01) in the percentage of G1 phase cells and a great decrease (P<0.01) in the percentage of S and G2 / M phase cells. It was concluded from above results that recombinant adenovirus Ad-PLCγ2 was packaged successfully, and could promote cell apoptosis by arresting the transition from G1 to S phase of BRL-3A cells.",

This study evaluated the PI-RADS diagnosis method in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <20 ng/ml. A total of 133 patients with PSA <20 ng/ml were prospectively recruited. T2-weighted (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted (DWI) magnetic resonance images of the prostate were acquired before a 12-core transrectal prostate biopsy. Each patient's peripheral zone was divided into six regions on the images; each region corresponded to two of the 12 biopsy cores. T2WI, DWI, and T2WI + DWI scores were computed according to PI-RADS. The diagnostic accuracy of the PI-RADS score was evaluated using histopathology of prostate biopsies as the reference standard. PCa was histologically diagnosed in 169 (21.2%) regions. Increased PI-RADS score correlated positively with increased cancer detection rate. The cancer detection rate for scores 1 to 5 was 2.8%, 15.0%, 34.6%, 52.6%, and 88.9%, respectively, using T2WI and 12.0%, 20.2%, 48.0%, 85.7%, and 93.3%, respectively, using DWI. For T2WI + DWI, the cancer detection rate was 1.5% (score 2), 13.5% (scores 3-4), 41.3% (scores 5-6), 75.9% (scores 7-8), and 92.3% (scores 9-10). The area under the curve for cancer detection was 0.700 (T2WI), 0.735 (DWI) and 0.749 (T2WI + DWI). The sensitivity and specificity were 53.8% and 89.2%, respectively, when using scores 5-6 as the cutoff value for T2WI + DWI. The PI-RADS score correlates with the PCa detection rate in patients with PSA <20 ng/ml. The summed score of T2WI + DWI has the highest accuracy in detection of PCa. However, the sensitivity should be further improved.",
  "27977319": "The relationship between thiamine and two symbioses: Root nodule symbiosis and arbuscular mycorrhiza Lotus japonicus THIC is expressed in all organs, and the encoded protein catalyzes thiamine biosynthesis. Loss of function produces chlorosis, a typical thiamine -deficiency phenotype, and mortality. To investigate thiamine's role in symbiosis, we focused on THI1, a thiamine-biosynthesis gene expressed in roots, nodules, and seeds. The thi1 mutant had green leaves, but formed small nodules and immature seeds. These phenotypes were rescued by THI1 complementation and by exogenous thiamine. Thus, THI1 is required for nodule enlargement and seed maturation. On the other hand, colonization by arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis was not affected in the thi1 mutant or by exogenous thiamine. However, spores of R. irregularis stored more thiamine than the source (host plants), despite lacking thiamine biosynthesis genes. Therefore, disturbance of the thiamine supply would affect progeny phenotypes such as spore formation and hyphal growth. Further investigation will be required to elucidate thiamine's effect on AM.",

This study assessed lesional and atrophy measures of white matter and gray matter involvement in patients with MS acquired in 7 European sites to identify the MR imaging variables most closely associated with cognitive dysfunction. Brain dual-echo, 3D T1-weighted, and double inversion recovery scans were acquired at 3T from 62 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 65 controls. Patients with at least 2 neuropsychological tests with abnormal findings were considered cognitively impaired. Focal WM and cortical lesions were identified, and volumetric measures from WM, cortical GM, the hippocampus, and deep GM nuclei were obtained. Age - and site -adjusted models were used to compare lesion and volumetric MR imaging variables between patients with MS who were cognitively impaired and cognitively preserved. A multivariate analysis identified MR imaging variables associated with cognitive scores and disability. Twenty-three patients (38%) were cognitively impaired. Compared with those with who were cognitively preserved, patients with MS with cognitive impairment had higher T2 and T1 lesion volumes and a trend toward a higher number of cortical lesions. Significant brain, cortical GM, hippocampal, deep GM nuclei, and WM atrophy was found in patients with MS with cognitive impairment versus those who were cognitively preserved. Hippocampal and deep GM nuclei atrophy were the best predictors of cognitive impairment, while WM atrophy was the best predictor of disability. Hippocampal and deep GM nuclei atrophy are key factors associated with cognitive impairment in MS. These MR imaging measures could be applied in a multicenter context, with cognition as clinical outcome.",
  "27932568": "Targeting HIF2 in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein (pVHL) is the signature \"truncal\" event in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, which is the most common form of kidney cancer. pVHL is part of a ubiquitin ligase the targets the α subunit of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor for destruction when oxygen is available. Preclinical studies strongly suggest that deregulation of HIF, and particularly HIF2, drives pVHL -defective renal carcinogenesis. Although HIF2α was classically considered undruggable, structural and chemical work by Rick Bruick and Kevin Gardner at University of Texas Southwestern laid the foundation for the development of small molecule direct HIF2α antagonists (PT2385 and the related tool compound PT2399) by Peloton Therapeutics that block the dimerization of HIF2α with its partner protein ARNT1. These compounds inhibit clear cell renal cell carcinoma growth in preclinical models, and PT2385 has now entered the clinic. Nonetheless, the availability of such compounds, together with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based gene editing approaches, has revealed a previously unappreciated heterogeneity among clear cell renal carcinomas and patient -derived xenografts with respect to HIF2 dependence, suggesting that predictive biomarkers will be needed to optimize the use of such agents in the clinic.",
  "27694780": "Dabigatran: A new oral anticoagulant. Guidelines to follow in oral surgery procedures. A systematic review of the literature Dabigatran is a newly commercialized drug that is replacing other anticoagulants in the prevention of venous thromboembolism, stroke and systemic arterial valve embolism. It acts directly on thrombin presenting in a dynamic and predictable way, which does not require monitoring these patients. Therefore, we consider the need to assess whether their use increases the risk of bleeding involved before any dental treatment. We performed a systematic review with a bibliographic search in PubMed / Medline along with the Cochrane Library. We excluded articles dealing with all anticoagulants other than dabigatran, and works about surgical treatments in anatomical locations other than the oral cavity. We included a total of 13 papers of which 1 was a randomized clinical trial, 9 narrative literature reviews, 1 case series, 2 clinical cases and 1 expert opinion. Because we did not obtain any properly designed clinical trials, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. Currently, there is no consensus on the procedure to be followed in patients taking dabigatran. However, all authors agree to treat each case individually in accordance to the risk of embolism, postoperative bleeding and renal function. Also, it is necessary to perform minimally invasive interventions, and take the appropriate local anti-hemolytic measures.",
  "28146402": "A Multicenter Study of Early Anti-inflammatory Treatment in Patients With Acute Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear It is increasingly recognized that biochemical abnormalities of the joint precede radiographic abnormalities of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) by as much as decades. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that the progression from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury to PTOA is multifactorial, involving the interplay between biomechanical disturbances and biochemical homeostasis of articular cartilage. The purposes of this randomized study using an acute ACL injury model were to (1) evaluate the natural progression of inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, (2) evaluate the relationship between subjective reports of pain and inflammatory and chondrodegenerative biomarkers, and (3) determine if postinjury arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection offer the ability to alter this biochemical cascade. Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. A total of 49 patients were randomized to 4 groups: group 1 (corticosteroid at 4 days after ACL injury, placebo injection of saline at 2 weeks), group 2 (placebo at 4 days after ACL injury, corticosteroid at 2 weeks), group 3 (corticosteroid at both time intervals), or a placebo group (saline injections at both time intervals). Patient-reported outcome measures and synovial biomarkers were collected at approximately 4 days, 11 days, and 5 weeks after injury. The change between the time points was assessed for all variables using Wilcoxon tests, and the relationship between changes in outcome scores and biomarkers were assessed by calculating Spearman ρ. Outcomes and biomarkers were also compared between the 4 groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests. No adverse events or infections were observed in any study patients. With the exception of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 (TSG-6), chondrodegenerative markers worsened over the first 5 weeks while all patient-reported outcomes improved during this time, regardless of treatment group. Patient-reported outcomes did not differ between patients receiving corticosteroid injections and the placebo group. However, increases in C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II), associated with collagen type II breakdown, were significantly greater in the placebo group (1.32 ± 1.10 ng/mL) than in either of the groups that received the corticosteroid injection within the first several days after injury (group 1: 0.23 ± 0.27 ng/mL [P = .01]; group 3: 0.19 ± 0.34 ng/mL [P = .01]). PTOA begins at the time of injury and results early on in dramatic matrix changes in the knee. However, it is encouraging that early intervention with an anti-inflammatory agent was able to affect biomarkers of chondral degeneration. Should early intervention lead to meaningful changes in either the onset or severity of symptomatic PTOA, the current treatment paradigm for patients with ACL injury may have to be restructured to include early aspiration and intra-articular intervention.

Study carried out in a preclinical porcine model Totally subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) delivers higher shock energy and can have longer time to therapy compared to transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (T-ICD). Aim of the study was to compare time to therapy and to investigate cardiac, cerebral and systemic injuries of S-ICD and T-ICD shocks delivered after ventricular fibrillation (VF) induction. Fourteen pigs were randomly implanted with a S-ICD (n = 7) or a T-ICD (n = 7). Five VF episodes were induced in each pig. For each VF episode, up to two shocks could be delivered by the T-ICD or the S-ICD to terminate the arrhythmia. Cardiac, systemic, and cerebral toxicity were monitored. Mean time to therapy was longer in the S-ICD group compared to the T-ICD group (19[18; 23] s vs. 9 [7; 10] s; P = 0.001, respectively). High-sensitivity troponin T levels were significantly higher in the T-ICD group from 1 to 24 h after the procedure (P ≤ 0.02). Creatine phosphokinase activity levels were significantly higher in the S-ICD group, at 3, 6, and 24 h after the procedure (P ≤ 0.05). Lactate levels were not significantly different between groups. S100 protein level was similar in both groups at 1 h after the procedure and then decreased in the T-ICD group compared to the S-ICD group (P = 0.04). Time to therapy in S-ICD was twice as long as for T-ICD, but didn't induce relevant brain injury. Conversely, S-ICD shocks were less cardiotoxic than T-ICD shocks.",

Twenty-five barrows (initial BW: 30.53 ± 1.73 kg) were equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and randomly allotted to a 25 × 8 Youden square design with 25 diets and 8 periods. Results indicate that the concentration of CP was greater (< 0.05) in SBM from Brazil and India (49.3 and 49.5%, respectively) than in SBM from China, Argentina, or the U.S. (45.1, 46.7, and 47.3%, respectively, as-fed basis). The concentration of most indispensable AA followed the same pattern as CP with the exception that SBM from the U.S. contained more (< 0.05) indispensable AA than SBM from China or Argentina. However, SBM from India contained more (< 0.05) trypsin inhibitors than SBM from the other countries. A greater (< 0.05) AID and SID of CP and most AA was observed in SBM from the U.S. compared with SBM from Brazil, Argentina, and India, but there were no differences between SBM from the U.S. and SBM from China. However, because of the lower concentration of AA in SBM from China, the concentration of standardized ileal digestible AA in SBM from China was less (< 0.05) than in SBM from the U.S. Soybean meal from the U.S. or Brazil had less (< 0.05) variability in SID values than SBM from Argentina, China, or India. In conclusion, the SID of CP and AA is dependent on the country where the SBM is produced. This difference and the variability within each country should be evaluated when formulating diets for pigs.",
  "28058593": "Ceftaroline fosamil for community-acquired pneumonia and skin and skin structure infections: a systematic review Background Ceftaroline is a parentally administered cephalosporin that has an in vitro expanded spectrum of activity compared with other cephalosporins yet data is conflicting regarding its place in therapy. Aim of the Review To compare the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline against standard antibiotic regimens for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs). Method The databases of MEDLINE, EBSCO, and Embase were searched up to June 2016. Manual review of references was completed and experts in the field were contacted for unpublished data. Randomized controlled trials of ceftaroline in CAP or cSSSI populations were included. Outcomes included clinical cure, mortality, adverse events, serious adverse events, and discontinuation due to adverse events. Meta-analysis was used to pool results for these outcomes. We performed subgroup analyses for gram positive infections in CAP and infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in cSSSIs. Risk of bias was assessed for all studies. Results Six trials (three for each indication) were included, each of which had an unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. For CAP, ceftaroline was significantly more efficacious in achieving clinical cure than ceftriaxone [risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.19; I(2) = 47%]. For cSSSIs, there was no significant difference in clinical cure between ceftaroline and vancomycin plus aztreonam (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.05; I(2) = 0%). No differences were found for overall mortality, serious adverse events, discontinuation due to adverse events, and overall adverse events. Conclusion Ceftaroline is a viable therapeutic alternative for patients with CAP and cSSSIs, yet identified risks of bias and poor external validity preclude it from being recommended as a first-line agent.",

  "28258403": "Structural properties and psychometric improvements of the Health Literacy Questionnaire in a Slovak population Health literacy is an important determinant of health and health equity and therefore requires robust measurement. The aim was to examine the psychometric properties of the Slovak version of the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) including revised wording of response categories. A cross-sectional survey of the general Slovak adult population (N = 360, mean age 39) was conducted with the HLQ following its translation and cultural adaptation. Psychometric tests (confirmatory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability) and association (linear regression, ANOVA) with sociodemographic variables were undertaken. The performance of alternative version of response options were explored with the Mann-Whittney U test and item response theory. A highly restrictive nine-factor confirmatory factor analysis showed acceptable fit [χ (2)WLSMV = 1684 (df = 866), p < 0.0001; CFI = 0.943, TLI = 0.938, RMSEA = 0.051, WRMR = 1.297] and reliability was acceptable (range 0.73-0.84). The revised response categories had a better distribution with lower average scores in three domains, compared with the original, and improved item information curves. The nine HLQ scales are robust, providing a fine-grained assessment of health literacy. The revised response options improve psychometric properties and are recommended for future studies.",
  "27371819": "The nurse-patient communication: voices from nursing students Effective communication skills have been found to be one of the pivotal factors in building positive interpersonal relationships. Little is known about nursing undergraduates ' perspectives on communicating with patients. This study aimed to explore nursing students' perspectives and experiences of nurse-patient communication in their clinical placement. The participants included 21 second-year undergraduates and 21 first-year master's students. Interviews were conducted in Cantonese and then transcribed in Chinese and translated into English. A content analysis approach was adopted to analyze the data. Five themes emerged from the interview data. 'The necessity of nurse-patient communication ' reveals why the students valued nurse-patient communication. 'The conversation contents ' describes the content of the conversations that students typically had with patients. The third theme is ' self-reflection on the nurse-patient communication '. The last two themes, 'the communication pattern in different hospital settings ' and 'the obstacles impeding nurse-patient communication ', are about the students' communication styles in different hospitals and the barriers they encounter. To improve students' communication skills, educators and clinical staff should listen to students, enhance students' reflective skills and strengthen their confidence. Through understanding students' difficulties in the nurse-patient communication experience and the skills that they lack, educators can provide them with helpful recommendations to improve their communication skills in clinical practice. The results of this study reveal that students' nurse-patient communication skills need to be improved.",

Expression of 46 selected microRNAs was studied in formalin -fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 165), ampullary cancer (n=59), duodenal cancer (n = 6), distal common bile duct cancer (n = 21), and gastric cancer (n = 20); chronic pancreatitis (n = 39); and normal pancreas (n = 35). The microRNAs were analyzed by PCR using the Fluidigm platform. Twenty-two microRNAs were significantly differently expressed in patients with pancreatic cancer when compared to healthy controls and chronic pancreatitis patients; 17 miRNAs were upregulated (miR-21-5p, - 23a-3p, - 31-5p, - 34c-5p, - 93-3p, - 135b-3p, - 155-5p, - 186-5p, - 196b-5p, - 203, - 205-5p, - 210, - 222-3p, - 451, - 492, - 614, and miR-622) and 5 were downregulated (miR-122-5p, - 130b-3p, - 216b, - 217, and miR-375). MicroRNAs were grouped into diagnostic indices of varying complexity. Ten microRNAs associated with prognosis were identified (let-7 g, miR-29a-5p, - 34a-5p, - 125a-3p, - 146a-5p, - 187, - 205-5p, - 212-3p, - 222-5p, and miR-450b-5p). Prognostic indices based on differences in expression of 2 different microRNAs were constructed for pancreatic and ampullary cancer combined and separately (30, 5, and 21 indices). The study confirms that pancreatic cancer tissue has a microRNA expression profile that is different from that of other periampullary cancers, chronic pancreatitis, and normal pancreas. We identified prognostic microRNAs and microRNA indices that were associated with shorter overall survival in patients with radically resected pancreatic cancer.",
  "28329231": "Cardiac protective effects of remote ischaemic preconditioning in children undergoing tetralogy of fallot repair surgery: a randomized controlled trial Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) by inducing brief ischaemia in distant tissues protects the heart against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in children undergoing open-heart surgery, although its effectiveness in adults with comorbidities is controversial. The effectiveness and mechanism of RIPC with respect to myocardial IRI in children with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), a severe cyanotic congenital cardiac disease, undergoing open heart surgery are unclear. We hypothesized that RIPC can confer cardioprotection in children undergoing ToF repair surgery. Overall, 112 ToF children undergoing radical open cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were randomized to either a RIPC group (n = 55) or a control group (n = 57). The RIPC protocol consisted of three cycles of 5-min lower limb occlusion and 5-min reperfusion using a cuff-inflator. Serum inflammatory cytokines and cardiac injury markers were measured before surgery and after CPB. Right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT) tissues were collected during the surgery to assess hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif)-1α and other signalling proteins. Cardiac mitochondrial injury was assessed by electron microscopy. The primary results showed that the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) was longer in the control group than in the RIPC group (52.30 ± 13.43 h vs. 47.55 ± 10.34 h, respectively, P = 0.039). Patients in the control group needed longer post-operative ventilation time compared to the RIPC group (35.02 ± 6.56 h vs. 31.96 ± 6.60 h, respectively, P = 0.016). The levels of post-operative serum troponin-T at 12 and 18 h, CK-MB at 24 h, as well as the serum h-FABP levels at 6 h, after CPB were significantly lower, which was coincident with significantly higher protein expression of cardiac Hif-1α, p-Akt, p-STAT3, p-STAT5, and p-eNOS and less vacuolization of mitochondria in the RIPC group compared to the control group. In ToF children undergoing open heart surgery, RIPC attenuates myocardial IRI and improves the short-term prognosis.",
  "28051263": "Psychological factors associated with NAFLD / NASH: a systematic review Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide. So far, the pathogenesis of NAFLD and its more severe variant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is yet unclear, with many mechanisms being proposed as possible causes. This article aims to review the psychological factors associated with NAFLD / NASH. Three main categories of factors have been investigated: emotional, cognitive and behavioral. Five electronic databases were searched, limited to studies published in the English language, during the period 2005-2015: PubMed, Thomson ISI - Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect. Results indicated the most relevant emotional factors to be depression and anxiety. The areas of investigation for cognitive functioning concern those contents and processes related to the ability to initiate and maintain lifestyle changes. The most important behavioral factors identified are physical activity, nutrition / food intake and substance consumption: coffee, alcohol, cigarettes. Some of the factors identified act as protective factors, other as vulnerability factors. NAFLD / NASH may be considered a cognitive-behavioral disease, the most effective management being lifestyle changes, with emphasis on diet and exercise.",
  "27738068": "Cryoballoon ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation: feasibility and safety of left atrial roof ablation with generation of conduction block in addition to antral pulmonary vein isolation Although the generation of linear lesions by ablation improves success rates in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), the procedure has been considered unsuitable for cryoablation balloon catheter technologies. We developed a technique for linear ablations, using second-generation cryoballoon technology. This was a single-arm, prospective study in 76 patients with persistent AF treated consecutively at our centre. Cryoablation was performed using a 28 mm second-generation cryoballoon. The first cryoenergy application was performed in close proximity to the position during isolation of the left superior pulmonary vein (PV). Sequential overlapping freezes were applied along the left atrial (LA) roof by slight clockwise rotation of the sheath in combination with slight retraction of the sheath and incremental advancement of the cryoballoon, until reaching the original position for right superior PV isolation. The acute endpoint was the creation of a roofline, defined as complete conduction block across the LA roof >120 ms and ascending activation across the posterior LA wall. Acute success in roofline generation was achieved in 88% of patients, applying on average five (median 4-6) freezes with nadir temperature of -40°C (-36 to -44°C). In five patients, conduction block could not be achieved. No phrenic nerve injuries occurred during roofline generation. Generation of linear roofline lesions is possible with the second-generation cryoballoon. The technique can be used in combination with PV isolation to treat persistent AF with good acute success rates, short procedure times, and acceptable safety concerns. If validated by further studies, the method would be an appealing alternative to radiofrequency ablation techniques.",
  "27932585": "Structural and functional characterization of the TYW3 / Taw3 class of SAM-dependent methyltransferases S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases regulate a wide range of biological processes through the modification of proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, as well as various metabolites. TYW3 / Taw3 is a SAM-dependent methyltransferase responsible for the formation of a tRNA modification known as wybutosine and its derivatives that are required for accurate decoding in protein synthesis. Here, we report the crystal structure of Taw3, a homolog of TYW3 from Sulfolobus solfataricus, which revealed a novel α/β fold. The sequence motif (S/T)xSSCxGR and invariant aspartate and histidine, conserved in TYW3 / Taw3, cluster to form the catalytic center. These structural and sequence features indicate that TYW3 / Taw3 proteins constitute a distinct class of SAM-dependent methyltransferases. Using site-directed mutagenesis along with in vivo complementation assays combined with mass spectrometry as well as ligand docking and cofactor binding assays, we have identified the active site of TYW3 and residues essential for cofactor binding and methyltransferase activity.",
  "27542694": "Development of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for quantitative analysis of trace d-amino acids d-Amino acids have recently attracted much attention in various research fields including medical, clinical and food industry due to their important biological functions that differ from l-amino acid. Most chiral amino acid separation techniques require complicated derivatization procedures in order to achieve the desirable chromatographic behavior and detectability. Thus, the aim of this research is to develop a highly sensitive analytical method for the enantioseparation of chiral amino acids without any derivatization process using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). By optimizing MS/MS parameters, we established a quantification method that allowed the simultaneous analysis of 18 d-amino acids with high sensitivity and reproducibility. Additionally, we applied the method to food sample (vinegar) for the validation, and successfully quantified trace levels of d-amino acids in samples. These results demonstrated the applicability and feasibility of the LC-MS/MS method as a novel, effective tool for d-amino acid measurement in various biological samples.",
  "28239454": "Transcriptional analysis of blaNDM-1 and copy number alteration under carbapenem stress New Delhi metallo beta-lactamase is known to compromise carbapenem therapy and leading to treatment failure. However, their response to carbapenem stress is not clearly known. Here, we have investigated the transcriptional response of blaNDM-1 and plasmid copy number alteration under carbapenem exposure. Three blaNDM-1 harboring plasmids representing three incompatibility types (IncFIC, IncA/C and IncK) were inoculated in LB broth with and without imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem. After each 1 h total RNA was isolated, immediately reverse transcribed into cDNA and quantitative real time PCR was used for transcriptional expression of blaNDM-1. Horizontal transferability and stability of the plasmids encoding blaNDM-1 were also determined. Changes in copy number of blaNDM-1 harboring plasmids under the exposure of different carbapenems were determined by real time PCR. Clonal relatedness among the isolates was determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Under carbapenem stress over an interval of time there was a sharp variation in the transcriptional expression of blaNDM-1 although it did not follow a specific pattern. All blaNDM-1 carrying plasmids were transferable by conjugation. These plasmids were highly stable and complete loss was observed between 92(nd) to 96(th) serial passages when antibiotic pressure was withdrawn. High copy number of blaNDM-1 was found for IncF type plasmids compared to the other replicon types. This study suggests that the single dose of carbapenem pressure does not significantly influence the expression of blaNDM-1 and also focus on the stability of this gene as well as the change in copy number with respect to the incompatible type of plasmid harboring resistance determinant.",
  "28233874": "Comprehensive analysis of long non-coding RNAs highlights their spatio-temporal expression patterns and evolutional conservation in Sus scrofa Despite modest sequence conservation and rapid evolution, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) appear to be conserved in expression pattern and function. However, analysis of lncRNAs across tissues and developmental stages remains largely uncharacterized in mammals. Here, we systematically investigated the lncRNAs of the Guizhou miniature pig (Sus scrofa), which was widely used as biomedical model. We performed RNA sequencing across 9 organs and 3 developmental skeletal muscle, and developed a filtering pipeline to identify 10,813 lncRNAs (9,075 novel). Conservation patterns analysis revealed that 57% of pig lncRNAs showed homology to humans and mice based on genome alignment. 5,455 lncRNAs exhibited typical hallmarks of regulatory molecules, such as high spatio-temporal specificity. Notably, conserved lncRNAs exhibited higher tissue specificity than pig - specific lncRNAs and were significantly enriched in testis and ovary. Weighted co-expression network analysis revealed a set of conserved lncRNAs that are likely involved in postnatal muscle development. Based on the high degree of similarity in the structure, organization, and dynamic expression of pig lncRNAs compared with human and mouse lncRNAs, we propose that these lncRNAs play an important role in organ physiology and development in mammals. Our results provide a resource for studying animal evolution, morphological complexity, breeding, and biomedical research.",
  "28471447": "MicroRNA-18a-5p functions as an oncogene by directly targeting IRF2 in lung cancer Lung cancer is the major form of cancer resulting in cancer-related mortality around the world. MicroRNAs are endogenous small non-coding single-stranded RNAs, which can engage in the regulation of gene expression. In this study, miR-18a-5p significantly upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and NSCLC cell lines, suggesting an oncogenic function in lung cancer. Additionally, miR-18a-5p can promote carcinogenesis by directly targeting interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2). Further experiments indicated that IRF2 can increase cell apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation and migration ability. Our study demonstrates that miR-18a-5p promotes autophagy in NSCLC. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-18a-5p can not only promote NSCLC by suppressing IRF2, but also will be a promising target in the near future.",
  "28027117": "Precision Medicine Starts With Preanalytics: Real-Time Assessment of Tissue Fixation Quality by Ultrasound Time-of-Flight Analysis Personalized medicine promises diagnosis and treatment of disease at the individual level and relies heavily on clinical specimen integrity and diagnostic assay quality. Preanalytics, the collection and handling steps of a clinical specimen before immunohistochemistry or other clinical assay, are critically important to enable the correct diagnosis of disease. However, the effects of preanalytics are often overlooked due to a lack of standardization and limited assessment tools to quantify their variation. Here, we report a novel real-time ultrasound time-of-flight instrument that is capable of monitoring and imaging the critical step in formalin fixation, diffusion of the fixative into tissue, which provides a quantifiable quality metric for tissue fixation in the clinical laboratory ensuring consistent downstream molecular assay results. We analyzed hundreds of tissue specimens from 34 distinct human tissue types and 12 clinically relevant diseased tissues for diffusion and fixation metrics. Our measurements can be converted into tissue diffusivity constants that correlate with the apparent diffusion constant calculated using magnetic resonance imaging (R=0.83), despite the differences in the approaches, indicating that our approach is biophysically plausible. Using data collected from time-of-flight analysis of many tissues, we have therefore developed a novel rapid fixation program that could ensure high-quality downstream assay results for a broad range of human tissue types.",

This retrospective study included 67 SCCL patients with obtainable lung cancer tissue and records on EGFR-TKI treatment response and survival. EGFR protein expression in lung cancer tissue was measured by immunohistochemistry with a specific antibody that recognizes the intracellular domain (ID) of EGFR. PTEN expression in lung cancer tissue was also evaluated with immunohistochemistry. PI3KCA gene amplification was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and FGFR1 amplification was assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. EGFR ID expression (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53, P=0.022) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (HR 0.43, P=0.022) were significantly related with progression - free survival following EGFR-TKIs treatment. PTEN expression (HR 0.52, P=0.025) was significantly related to overall survival. The group of EGFR - positive or PTEN - positive patients with ECOG PS of 0 or 1 had better clinical outcomes than patients who were EGFR - negative and PTEN - negative or who had poor ECOG PS with longer median progression - free survival (2.1 vs 1.0 months, P=0.05) and overall survival (6.2 vs 2.1 months, P=0.05). EGFR expression using an ID -specific antibody and PTEN protein expression may be used to identify SCCL patients who might benefit from EGFR-TKI treatment.",
  "28329001": "Experimental demonstration of the possible role of Acanthamoeba polyphaga in the infection and disease progression in Buruli Ulcer (BU) using ICR mice The transmission of Buruli ulcer (BU), caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), remains puzzling although a number of hypothesis including through bites of infected aquatic insects have been proposed. We report the results of experiments using ICR mice that give credence to our hypothesis that Acanthamoeba species may play a role in BU transmission. We cocultured MU N2 and MU 1615 which expresses red fluorescent protein (RFP) and Acanthamoeba polyphaga (AP), and confirmed infected AP by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining. We tested for viability of MU inside AP and observed strong RFP signals inside both trophozoites and cysts after 3 and 42 days of coculturing respectively. ICR mice were topically treated, either on shaved intact or shaved pinpricked rumps, with one of the following; MU N2 only (2.25 x 106 colony forming units [CFU] / ml), MU N2: AP coculture (2.96 x 104 CFU: 1.6 x 106 cells/ml), AP only (1.6 x 106 cells/ml), PYG medium and sterile distilled water. Both MU N2 only and MU N2: AP elicited reddening on day (D) 31; edema on D 45 and D 44 respectively, and ulcers on D 49 at pinpricked sites only. To ascertain infectivity and pathogenicity of MU N2 only and MU N2: AP, and compare their virulence, the standard mouse footpad inoculation method was used. MU N2: AP elicited reddening in footpads by D 3 compared to D 14 with MU N2 only of the same dose of MU N2 (2.96 x 104 CFU). ZN-stained MU were observed in both thin sectioned and homogenized lesions, and aspirates from infected sites. Viable MU N2 were recovered from cultures of the homogenates and aspirates. This study demonstrates in ICR mice MU transmission via passive infection, and shows that punctures in the skin are prerequisite for infection, and that coculturing of MU with AP enhances pathogenesis.",
  "28473531": "Oncogenic RAS regulates long non-coding RNA Orilnc1 in human cancer RAS and its downstream cascades transmit cellular signals resulting in increased transcription of genes involved in cell growth and division. Protein-coding gene targets of RAS signaling have been characterized extensively, but long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) regulated by these processes have not. Using a custom-designed lncRNA microarray, we identified the lncRNA Orilnc1 as a genetic target of RAS that is critical for RAS oncogenicity. Orilnc1 expression was regulated by RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling via the transcription factor AP1. Orilnc1 was highly expressed in BRAF-mutant cancers such as melanoma. Silencing of Orilnc1 blocked tumor cell proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, Orilnc1 blockade reduced expression of Cyclin E1 and induced G1/S cell cycle arrest in tumor cells. Taken together, our results identify Orilnc1 as a novel, non-protein mediator of RAS/RAF activation which may serve as a therapeutic target in RAS/RAF-driven cancers.",
  "27445319": "Morphological and enzymatic response of the thermotolerant fungus Fomes sp. EUM1 in solid state fermentation under thermal stress Thermotolerance of the fungus Fomes sp. EUM1 was evaluated in solid state fermentation (SSF). This thermotolerant strain improved both hyphal invasiveness (38%) and length (17%) in adverse thermal conditions exceeding 30°C and to a maximum of 40°C. In contrast, hyphal branching decreased by 46% at 45°C. The production of cellulases over corn stover increased 1.6-fold in 30°C culture conditions, xylanases increased 2.8-fold at 40°C, while laccase production improved 2.7-fold at 35°C. Maximum production of lignocellulolytic enzymes was obtained at elevated temperatures in shorter fermentation times (8 to 6 days), although the proteases appeared as a thermal stress response associated with a drop in lignocellulolytic activities. Novel and multiple isoenzymes of xylanase (four bands) and cellulase (six bands) were secreted in the range of 20-150 kDa during growth in adverse temperature conditions. However, only a single laccase isoenzyme (46 kDa) was detected. This is the first report describing the advantages of a thermotolerant white-rot fungus in SSF. These results have important implications for large-scale SSF, where effects of metabolic heat are detrimental to growth and enzyme production, which are severely affected by the formation of high temperature gradients.",
  "27629156": "Simultaneous determination of eight metabolites of organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides in urine A simultaneous method for quantifying eight metabolites of organophosphate pesticides and pyrethroid pesticides in urine samples has been established. The analytes were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction coupled with WCX solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Eight metabolites were chemically derivatized before analysis using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS-MS). The separation was performed on a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) with temperature programming. The detection was performed under electro-spray ionization (ESI) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. An internal standard method was used. The extraction solvent, types of SPE cartridges and eluents were optimized by comparing the sample recoveries under different conditions. The results showed that the calibration curves of the five organophosphorus pesticides metabolites were linear in the range of 0.2-200 μg/L (r(2) ≥ 0.992) and that of the three pyrethroid pesticides metabolites were linear in the range of 0.025-250 μg/L (r(2) ≥ 0.991). The limits of detection (LODs, S/N ≥ 3) and the limits of quantification (LOQs, S/N ≥ 10) of the eight metabolites were 0.008-0.833 μg/L and 0.25-2.5 μg/L, respectively. The recoveries of the eight metabolites ranged from 54.08% to 82.49%. This efficient, stable, and cost-effective method is adequate to handle the large number of samples required for surveying the exposure level of organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides in the general population.",

We investigated the prevalence of features of BED and their association with body mass index (BMI) and psychological distress among men (n = 2423) and women (n = 2825) from the longitudinal community-based FinnTwin16 cohort (born 1975-1979). Seven eating -related cognitions and behaviors similar to the defining features of BED were extracted from the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 and were assessed at a mean age of 24. BMI and psychological distress, measured with the General Health Questionnaire, were assessed at ages 24 and 34. We assessed prevalence of the features and their association with BMI and psychological distress cross-sectionally and prospectively. More than half of our participants reported at least one feature of BED; clustering of several features in one individual was less common, particularly among men. The most frequently reported feature was ' stuffing oneself with food ', whereas the least common was ' eating or drinking in secrecy '. All individual features of BED and their clustering particularly were associated with higher BMI and more psychological distress cross-sectionally. Prospectively, the clustering of features of BED predicted increase in psychological distress but not additional weight gain when baseline BMI was accounted for. In summary, although some features of BED were common, the clustering of several features in one individual was not. The features were cumulatively associated with BMI and psychological distress and predicted further increase in psychological distress over ten years of follow-up.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of AAPR in patients with metastatic NPC. We retrospectively reviewed 209 metastatic NPC patients treated with cisplatin -based regimens. Survival data were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards regression methodology. The optimal cutoff level of AAPR for assessing overall survival (OS) was 0.447, which was determined by R software. An AAPR less than 0.447 was significantly associated with a higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (273 vs. 185 U/L, P = 0.004), a higher EBV DNA viral load (5.59×10(5) vs. 3.49×10(4) copies/ml, P = 0.001), and more liver and bone metastases (P = 0.005 and P = 0.001, respectively). Additionally, patients with an AAPR < 0.447 had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 3.269, 95% confidence interval: 1.710-6.248; HR: 2.295, 95% confidence interval: 1.217-4.331, respectively) than those with an AAPR ≥ 0.447. Our study suggested that the AAPR might be a novel prognostic factor in metastatic NPC patients treated with cisplatin -based regimens. However, a prospective study to validate its prognostic value is needed, and the mechanisms underlying the low AAPR and poor survival in metastatic NPC need to be further investigated.",
  "28053655": "An investigation of fungal contamination on the surface of medicinal herbs in China The dried parts of medicinal herbs are susceptible to the infection of fungi during p re- or post-harvest procedure. This study aimed to investigate the presence of fungi and their metabolites mycotoxins on the surface of medicinal herbs collected from China. Forty-five retail samples of 15 different medicinal herbs were collected from 3 different regions in China. Then the potential fungi were immediately washed off from the surface of each sample with 0.1% Tween-20 followed by incubation of the rinse on petri-dish with potato dextrose agar containing chloramphenicol at 28 °C. The obtained fungi were isolated as single colonies and then characterized by morphology and molecular identification using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing with extracted DNA. Meanwhile, the mycotoxin -producing potential of the isolates was studied by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS / MS). A total of 126 fungi were identified from the surface of samples by morphology and ITS sequencing, with Aspergillus and Penicillium genera as the predominant contaminants. The mycotoxin -producing potential analysis showed that 6 of 8 A. versicolor isolates could produce sterigmatocystin. All 3 A. aculeatus isolates produced ochratoxin A, but only 1 of 3 A. flavus strains produced aflatoxins B1 and B2 without G1 and G2. Although the sample contamination ratios were high (≥95.6%), there was no significant difference (χ(2) = 1.05, P = 1.0) among the samples from 3 regions, which demonstrates the prevalent fungal contamination in the herbal medicines. The prevalent contamination phenomenon of fungi and high potential risk of sterigmatocystin and ochratoxin A were observed in 45 medicinal herbs collected from China.",

  "28440461": "The role of miR-451 in the switching between proliferation and migration in malignant glioma cells: AMPK signaling, mTOR modulation and Rac1 activation required Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), WHO grade IV astrocytoma, is the most common primary neoplasm of the central nervous system (CNS) and has the highest malignancy and mortality rates. The invasive nature of GBM complicates surgical resection and restricts chemotherapeutic access, contributing to poor patient prognosis. The migration of tumor cells is closely related to the tumor cell proliferation. The acquisition of migratory capability, in addition to intracellular factors, is proposed to be a crucial mechanism during the progression of invasion. Using qRT-PCR analysis, we determined that the expression of miR-451 in glioma tissue was lower than in control brain tissue, especially in the central portions of the tumor. In glioma cell lines, we found that decreased miR-451 expression suppressed tumor cell proliferation but enhanced migration with a concomitant low level of CAB39 / AMPK / mTOR pathway activation and high level of Rac1 / cofilin pathway activation, respectively. Notably, the effect of miR-451 on cytological behavior and on the activation of mTOR and Rac1 was limited when AMPKα1 expression was knocked-down with a synthetic shRNA. We suggest that the glioma microenvironment results in heterogeneity of miR-451 expression. Our data indicated that miR-451 relays environmental signals by upregulating the activity of AMPK signaling, thereby modulating the activation of mTOR and Rac1 / cofilin which, in turn, play key roles in glioma cell proliferation and migration, respectively. Our results highlight the need to consider opposing roles of a therapeutic target which, while suppressing tumor cell proliferation, could also promote cell infiltration.",
  "28096973": "A fission yeast cell-based system for multidrug resistant HIV-1 proteases HIV-1 protease (PR) is an essential enzyme for viral production. Thus, PR inhibitors (PIs) are the most effective class of anti-HIV drugs. However, the main challenge to the successful use of PI drugs in patient treatment is the emergence of multidrug resistant PRs (mdrPRs). This study aimed to develop a fission yeast cell-based system for rapid testing of new PIs that combat mdrPRs. Three mdrPRs were isolated from HIV-infected patients that carried seven (M7PR), ten (M10PR) and eleven (M11PR) PR gene mutations, respectively. They were cloned and expressed in fission yeast under an inducible promoter to allow the measurement of PR -specific proteolysis and drug resistance. The results showed that all three mdrPRs maintained their abilities to proteolyze HIV viral substrates (MA ↓ CA and p6) and to confer drug resistance. Production of these proteins in the fission yeast caused cell growth inhibition, oxidative stress and altered mitochondrial morphologies that led to cell death. Five investigational PIs were used to test the utility of the established yeast system with an FDA - approved PI drug Darunavir (DRV) as control. All six compounds suppressed the wildtype PR (wtPR) and the M7PR -mediated activities. However, none of them were able to suppress the M10PR or the M11PR. The three clinically isolated mdrPRs maintained their viral proteolytic activities and drug resistance in the fission yeast. Furthermore, those viral mdrPR activities were coupled with the induction of growth inhibition and cell death, which could be used to test the PI activities. Indeed, the five investigational PIs and DRV suppressed the wtPR in fission yeast as they did in mammalian cells. Significantly, two of the high level mdrPRs (M10PR and M11PR) were resistant to all of the existing PI drugs including DRV. This observation underscores the importance of continued searching for new PIs against mdrPRs.",
  "28125006": "Support Vector Machine Classification of Drunk Driving Behaviour Alcohol is the root cause of numerous traffic accidents due to its pharmacological action on the human central nervous system. This study conducted a detection process to distinguish drunk driving from normal driving under simulated driving conditions. The classification was performed by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained to distinguish between these two classes by integrating both driving performance and physiological measurements. In addition, principal component analysis was conducted to rank the weights of the features. The standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDNN), the root mean square value of the difference of the adjacent R-R interval series (RMSSD), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), the ratio of the low and high frequencies (LF/HF), and average blink duration were the highest weighted features in the study. The results show that SVM classification can successfully distinguish drunk driving from normal driving with an accuracy of 70%. The driving performance data and the physiological measurements reported by this paper combined with air - alcohol concentration could be integrated using the support vector regression classification method to establish a better early warning model, thereby improving vehicle safety.",
  "28282510": "CXCR4 (CD184) expression on stem cell harvest and CD34(+) cells post-transplant CXCR4 is a receptor for stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a molecule that has a chemotactic activity for lymphocytes and is important in homing of hematopoietic stem cells to their adult marrow. We evaluated the CXCR4 (CD184) expression in the harvest cells and in the post-transplant bone marrow (BM) and its relation to engraftment, as determined by the consensus criteria and chimerism. This is a prospective study which included 30 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; 15 patients received autograft and 15 patients received allograft on dates between January 2012 and May 2014. We assessed CD184 (CXCR4) using flow cytometry in the harvest cells together with post-transplant BM assessment on Day 28 and Day 90 for complete morphologic, molecular studies, and detection of CD184 expression on CD34(+) cells with chimerism studies on total peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Diagnoses of the enrolled patients were as follows: seven (24.1%) with acute myeloid leukemia, eight (27.6%) with multiple myeloma, four (13.8%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, three (10.3%) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two (6.9%) with myelodysplastic syndromes, two (6.9%) with aplastic anemia, two (6.9%) with chronic myeloid leukemia, one (3.4%) with Hodgkin lymphoma, and one (3.4%) with plasmacytomas. One patient died and was excluded from the study because there were not enough data about engraftment. There was no statistical significance between the level of CD184 in stem cell harvest and the prediction of successful engraftment (p>0.05) as well as in Day 28 BM sample (p>0.05), whereas there was a statistical significance between the level of CD184 in Day 90 BM sample and the occurrence of successful engraftment (p=0.002). SDF-1 / CXCR4 axis plays a crucial role in engraftment; however, more studies are warranted to assess their expression post-transplant. Evaluating the ligand (chemokine, SDF-1) or its receptor (CXCR4) may serve as potential surrogate markers for assessment of engraftment.",
  "27656565": "Evaluation of Outcome Following Coronectomy for the Management of Mandibular Third Molars in Close Proximity to Inferior Alveolar Nerve Iatrogenic damage to Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) is a significant risk factor following prophylactic or therapeutic removal of impacted mandibular third molar. The risk to IAN injury increases many fold, when the third molar root overlaps the nerve canal as identified by the radiographic imaging. Various methods like orthodontic assisted extraction, staged removal of tooth or coronectomy have been advocated to reduce the incidence of IAN injury in high risk cases with variable outcome. The aim of present study was to evaluate the fate of the root (resorbed, exfoliated, covered by bone) after coronectomy or intentional root retention of impacted mandibular 3(rd) molars in patients with high risk for inferior alveolar nerve damage as evaluated by the intra oral periapical radiograph. Twenty impacted mandibular third molar teeth, in 18 patients with high risk of injury to IAN based on Rood's Criteria in an intra oral periapical radiographic examination, between the age group of 18 to 40 years, were included in the study. Preoperatively the impacted third molars were evaluated clinically as well as radiographically. Pederson Difficulty Index and Winter's Classification of impacted tooth was recorded. Coronectomy was done at the cemento enamel junction leaving the roots 2-3mm below the alveolar crest and primary closure was done. Patients were evaluated periodically for two years at six months interval. Post operative pain, swelling, IAN injury or any other complications were observed and recorded. None of the patients had IAN injury and none required second surgical removal. There was no incidence of post-operative infection and none required second surgical intervention. However, two of our patients had failed coronectomy (10%) due to mobilization of roots intra operatively and the roots were removed. One patient developed profuse bleeding intra-operatively in the failed coronectomy case. One patient had temporary lingual nerve paresthesia. Coronectomy procedure is effective in controlling inferior alveolar nerve injury following third molar surgery, in radiographically evaluated high risk cases and it has very low incidence of complications.",
  "27837915": "Toward optimizing dental implant performance: Surface characterization of Ti and TiZr implant materials Targeting understanding enhanced osseointegration kinetics, the goal of this study was to characterize the surface morphology and composition of Ti and TiZr dental implant substrates subjected to one of two surface treatments developed by Straumann. These two treatments are typically known as SLA and SLActive, with the latter resulting in more rapid osseointegration. A range of techniques was applied to characterize four different substrate / surface treatment combinations (TiSLA, TiSLActive, TiZrSLA, and TiZrSLActive). Contact angle measurements establish establish their hydrophilic / hydrophobic nature. Surface morphology was probed with scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction, Raman μ-spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to elucidate the composition of the near- surface region. Consistent with previous work, surface morphology was found to differ only at the nanoscale, with both SLActive substrates displaying nano - protrusions. Spectroscopic data indicate that all substrates exhibit surface films of titanium oxide displaying near TiO2 stoichiometry. Raman μ-spectroscopy reveals that amorphous TiO2 is most likely the only phase present on TiSLA, whilst rutile - TiO2 is also evidenced on TiSLActive, TiZrSLA, and TiZrSLActive. For TiZr alloy substrates, there is no evidence of discrete phases of oxidized Zr. X-ray photoelectron spectra demonstrate that all samples are terminated by adventitious carbon, with it being somewhat thicker (∼1nm) on TiSLA and TiZrSLA. Given previous in vivo studies, acquired data suggest that both nanoscale protrusions, and a thinner layer of adventitious carbon contribute to the more rapid osseointegration of SLActive dental implants. Composition of the surface oxide layer is apparently less important in determining osseointegration kinetics.",

The differences correspond to the distribution and structure of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids as well as other metabolites. These differences depended on the type and the grade of cancer. The sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs on individual specific was also discussed. Here, we emphasize that FTIR spectroscopy and imaging can be considered as a promising technique and will find its place on the detection of this dreadful disease because of high sensitivity, accuracy and inexpensive technique. Now the medical community started using and accepting this technique for early stage cancer detection. But, this technique endures several challenges on its application into the diagnosis of cancer in regards of sample preparations, data interpretation, and data analysis.

Our previous study indicated that obesity increases activity of the pro-tumorigenic Wnt-signaling. Presently, we sought to further advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which obesity promotes CRC by examining associations between microbiome, inflammation and Wnt-signaling in Apc(+/1638N) mice whose obesity was induced by one of two modalities, diet - or genetically-induced obesity. Three groups were employed: Apc(+/1638N) Lepr(+/+) fed a low fat diet (10% fat), Apc(+/1638N) Lepr(+/+) fed a high fat diet (60% fat, diet - induced obesity), and Apc(+/1638N) Lepr(db/db) fed a low fat diet (genetically-induced obesity). All animals received diets for 16 weeks from 8 to 24 weeks of age. The abundance of 19 bowel cancer -associated bacterial taxa were examined by real-time PCR. The abundance of Turicibacter and Desulfovibrio decreased, but F. prausnitizii increased, in diet - induced obese mice (p < 0.05). In contrast, in genetically-induced obese mice, Bifidobacterium, A. muciniphila and E. rectale decreased, but Peptostrptococcus, and E. coli increased (p < 0.05). Both diet - and genetically-induced obesity altered the expression of genes involved in bacterial recognition (MyD88) and increased inflammation as indicated by elevated levels of cytokines (IFNγ and TNF-α for genetically-induced obesity, and IL-6 for diet - induced obesity). The elevated inflammation was associated with altered expression of genes that are integral components of the Wnt-signaling cascade in a fashion indicating its activation. These findings demonstrate that the composition of the small intestinal microbiome is affected differently in diet - and genetically-induced obesity, but both are associated with elevated intestinal inflammation and alterations of the Wnt pathway towards enhancing tumorigenesis.",

  "27553875": "Estimation of the HIV-1 backward mutation rate from transmitted drug-resistant strains One of the serious threats facing the administration of antiretroviral therapy to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infected patients is the reported increasing prevalence of transmitted drug resistance. However, given that HIV-1 drug-resistant strains are often less fit than the wild-type strains, it is expected that drug-resistant strains that are present during the primary phase of the HIV-1 infection are replaced by the fitter wild-type strains. This replacement of HIV-1 resistant mutations involves the emergence of wild-type strains by a process of backward mutation. How quickly the replacement happens is dependent on the class of HIV-1 mutation group. We estimate the backward mutation rates and relative fitness of various mutational groups known to confer HIV-1 drug resistance. We do this by fitting a stochastic model to data for individuals who were originally infected by an HIV-1 strain carrying any one of the known drug resistance -conferring mutations and observed over a period of time to see whether the resistant strain is replaced. To do this, we seek a distribution, generated from simulations of the stochastic model, that best describes the observed (clinical data) replacement times of a given mutation. We found that Lamivudine/Emtricitabine -associated mutations have a distinctly higher, backward mutation rate and low relative fitness compared to the other classes (as has been reported before) while protease inhibitors -associated mutations have a slower backward mutation rate and high relative fitness. For the other mutation classes, we found more uncertainty in their estimates.",
  "27763528": "Up-Regulation of Claudin-6 in the Distal Lung Impacts Secondhand Smoke -Induced Inflammation It has long been understood that increased epithelial permeability contributes to inflammation observed in many respiratory diseases. Recently, evidence has revealed that environmental exposure to noxious material such as cigarette smoke reduces tight junction barrier integrity, thus enhancing inflammatory conditions. Claudin-6 (Cldn6) is a tetraspanin transmembrane protein found within the tight junctional complex and is implicated in maintaining lung epithelial barriers. To test the hypothesis that increased Cldn6 ameliorates inflammation at the respiratory barrier, we utilized the Tet-On inducible transgenic system to conditionally over-express Clnd6 in the distal lung. Cldn6 transgenic (TG) and control mice were continuously provided doxycycline from postnatal day (PN) 30 until euthanasia date at PN90. A subset of Cldn6 TG and control mice were also subjected to daily secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) via a nose only inhalation system from PN30-90 and compared to room air (RA) controls. Animals were euthanized on PN90 and lungs were harvested for histological and molecular characterization. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was procured for the assessment of inflammatory cells and molecules. Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting revealed increased Cldn6 expression in TG vs. control animals and SHS decreased Cldn6 expression regardless of genetic up-regulation. Histological evaluations revealed no adverse pulmonary remodeling via Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining or any qualitative alterations in the abundance of type II pneumocytes or proximal non-ciliated epithelial cells via staining for cell specific propeptide of Surfactant Protein-C (proSP-C) or Club Cell Secretory Protein (CCSP), respectively. Immunoblotting and qRT-PCR confirmed the differential expression of Cldn6 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. As a general theme, inflammation induced by SHS exposure was influenced by the availability of Cldn6. These data reveal captivating information suggesting a role for Cldn6 in lungs exposed to tobacco smoke. Further research is critically necessary in order to fully explain roles for tight junctional components such as Cldn6 and other related molecules in lungs coping with exposure.",

MSPD parameters, such as solvent, solid support and clean-up sorbent, were optimized. Besides, since blank problems were observed for some parabens, these were investigated and blanks were tackled by precleaning all sorbents prior to use. Under final conditions, 0.5g of freeze-dried mollusk were dispersed with 1.2g of silica and packed into a cartridge containing 3g of C18, as on-line clean-up sorbent. This cartridge was eluted with 10mL of acetonitrile, evaporated and reconstituted in methanol for analysis. In the validation stage, successful linearity (R(2)>0.999), recoveries (between 71 and 117% for most analytes), precision (RSD lower than 21%) and limits of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ, lower than 0.4 and 1.4ngg(-1) dry weight respectively) levels were achieved. Finally, the new methodology was applied to mussel, clam and cockle samples. Methyl paraben was above the LOQ in five of the six samples (not found in one clam sample) at concentrations up to 7ngg(-1) dry weight.

This prospective case series included 42 consecutive patients with unilateral exudative AMD. Choroidal images were segmented into luminal area and stromal area. Choroidal vascularity index was defined as the ratio of luminal area to total choroid area. Mean choroidal vascularity index and mean choroidal thickness between study and fellow eyes of the same patient with dry AMD were compared using Student's t-test. There was a significantly lower choroidal vascularity index in eyes with exudative AMD (60.14 ± 4.55 vs. 62.75 ± 4.82, P < 0.01). Luminal area (P < 0.01) was decreased in eyes with exudative AMD but there was no significant difference in total choroid area (P = 0.05) and choroidal thickness (P = 0.93) between study and fellow eyes. Eyes with exudative AMD demonstrated reduced choroidal vascularity index but insignificant differences in choroidal thickness compared with their fellow eyes.

For the (co-) design of targeted patient information, it is key to involve this group in determining their communication barriers and information needs. Objective To gain insight into how people with low literacy use and evaluate written drug information, and to identify ways in which they feel the patient leaflet can be improved, and in particular how images could be used. Setting Food banks and an education institution for Dutch language training in the Netherlands. Method Semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews were held with low-literate participants (n = 45). The thematic framework approach was used for analysis to identify themes in the data. Main outcome measure Low-literate people's experience with patient information leaflets, ideas for improvements, and perceptions on possible uses for visuals. Results Patient information leaflets were considered discouraging to use, and information difficult to find and understand. Many rely on alternative information sources. The leaflet should be shorter, and improved in terms of organisation, legibility and readability. Participants thought images could increase the leaflet's appeal, help ask questions, provide an overview, help understand textual information, aid recall, reassure, and even lead to increased confidence, empowerment and feeling of safety. Conclusion Already at the stages of paying attention to the leaflet and maintaining interest in the message, low-literate patients experience barriers in the communication process through written drug information. Short, structured, visual / textual explanations can lower the motivational threshold to use the leaflet, improve understanding, and empower the low-literate target group.",

The most commonly described sites of distant metastasis are the bones, lungs, and liver, whereas axillary metastasis is seldom reported. We hereby present the case of a 66-year-old man with NPC, cT2N2M0, at diagnosis. He had completed chemoradiotherapy and been disease-free for 7 years. After that period, late recurrence in the form of a solitary axillary lymph node metastasis was detected and confirmed by core-needle biopsy. The lesion was chemoresistant but responded to salvage radiotherapy at a dose of 65 Gy in 21 fractions. Post-radiotherapy positron emission tomography scan showed no evidence of disease. We suggested that long-term follow-up of NPC patients is important because a late relapse may occur at an unusual site. Aggressive management of solitary metastasis may achieve good outcome.",

In this study, we tested cervical tissues at various stages of tumor progression for 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and also DNA promoter methylation profile of a panel of genes for its diagnostic potential. In total, 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and promoter methylation of 33 genes were evaluated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based technique, and bisulfate-based next generation sequencing. The 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine contents were significantly reduced in squamous cell carcinoma and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant difference in (1) 5-methylcytosine between normal and squamous cell carcinoma tissues (area under the curve = 0.946) and (2) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels among normal, squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous cell carcinoma. Analyses of our next generation sequencing results and data from five independent published studies consisting of 191 normal, 10 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 21 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 335 malignant tissues identified a panel of nine genes (ARHGAP6, DAPK1, HAND2, NKX2-2, NNAT, PCDH10, PROX1, PITX2, and RAB6C) which could effectively discriminate among the various groups with sensitivity and specificity of 80%-100% (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 12 gene promoters (ARHGAP6, HAND2, LHX9, HEY2, NKX2-2, PCDH10, PITX2, PROX1, TBX3, IKBKG, RAB6C, and DAPK1) were also methylated in one or more of the cervical cancer cell lines tested.

  "28003464": "Nat1 promotes translation of specific proteins that induce differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells Novel APOBEC1 target 1 (Nat1) (also known as \" p97 ,\" \" Dap5 ,\" and \" Eif4g2 \") is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein that is homologous to the C-terminal two thirds of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (Eif4g1). We previously showed that Nat1 - null mouse embryonic stem cells (mES cells) are resistant to differentiation. In the current study, we found that NAT1 and eIF4G1 share many binding proteins, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF3 and eIF4A and ribosomal proteins. However, NAT1 did not bind to eIF4E or poly(A)-binding proteins, which are critical for cap-dependent translation initiation. In contrast, compared with eIF4G1, NAT1 preferentially interacted with eIF2, fragile X mental retardation proteins (FMR), and related proteins and especially with members of the proline-rich and coiled-coil-containing protein 2 (PRRC2) family. We also found that Nat1 - null mES cells possess a transcriptional profile similar, although not identical, to the ground state, which is established in wild-type mES cells when treated with inhibitors of the ERK and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling pathways. In Nat1 - null mES cells, the ERK pathway is suppressed even without inhibitors. Ribosome profiling revealed that translation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (Map3k3) and son of sevenless homolog 1 (Sos1) is suppressed in the absence of Nat1 Forced expression of Map3k3 induced differentiation of Nat1 - null mES cells. These data collectively show that Nat1 is involved in the translation of proteins that are required for cell differentiation.",
  "28004225": "Modeling viscous dissipation during vocal fold contact: the influence of tissue viscosity and thickness with implications for hydration The mechanics of vocal fold contact during phonation is known to play a crucial role in both normal and pathological speech production, though the underlying physics is not well understood. Herein, a viscoelastic model of the stresses during vocal fold contact is developed. This model assumes the cover to be a poroelastic structure wherein interstitial fluid translocates in response to mechanical squeezing. The maximum interstitial fluid pressure is found to generally increase with decreasing viscous dissipation and/or decreasing tissue elasticity. A global minimum in the total contact stress, comprising interstitial fluid pressure and elastic stress in the tissue, is observed over the studied dimensionless parameter range. Interestingly, physiologically reasonable estimates for the governing parameters fall within this global minimum region. The model is validated against prior experimental and computational work, wherein the predicted contact stress magnitude and impact duration agree well with published results. Lastly, observations of the potential relationship between vocal fold hydration and increased risk of tissue damage are discussed based upon model predictions of stress as functions of cover layer thickness and viscosity.",
  "27515958": "Gut Microbiota and Alcoholic Liver Disease The gut-liver axis model has often explained liver disease physiopathology. Among the latter we can mention Non-Alcoholic Liver Steatosis (NAFLD), Liver Steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis. In this frame an altered Intestinal Permeability (IP) is the gate for antigenic / toxic substances from gut lumen until target organs such as liver in NAFLD. Altered intestinal permeability was discovered almost forty years ago as consequence of acute and chronic alcohol ingestion. Alcohol Liver Disease (ALD) is a systemic pathology whose beginning and end belong to the intestine. Several recent evidences from the literature show how gut microbiota composition can be altered by alcohol, affects IP and can be modulated by several nonpharmacological and pharmacological agents, becoming the target for ALD treatment. In this review we describe the definition of ALD, gut microbiota composition in healthy and ALD, definition and role of IP in ALD physiopathology and emerging evidences on gut microbiota modulation in ALD treatment from preliminary clinical and non-clinical studies.",

For a Rb+ methane diode-pumped alkali laser (DPAL), the temperature rise was obtained. Especially, the temperature differences (∼10 K) between lasing and un-lasing cases were well identified, which demonstrated a high sensitivity of the method. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of extending the methane -based TDLAS method to DPAL study.",
  "27394375": "Ictal unilateral blinking is an unreliable lateralizing sign in tuberous sclerosis complex Ictal unilateral blinking is an uncommon but reportedly reliable lateralizing sign, indicating an ipsilateral seizure focus. We aimed to determine its lateralizing utility in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We reviewed the video-EEGs of 92 children with TSC and drug-resistant epilepsy. Eleven (12%) had seizures with unilateral blinking, of which 10 underwent epilepsy surgery. Lateralization of seizures was inferred from other semiology, ictal scalp EEG and outcome following tuberectomy. Seizures manifesting with unilateral blinking were focal motor in four patients, focal motor evolving into epileptic spasms in six, and epileptic spasms with focal features in one. Associated unilateral facial contraction was seen in five patients and arm jerking in four. Lateralized scalp ictal rhythms were seen in seven patients. Following tuberectomies, seven patients are seizure free and two had >90% reduction. Overall lateralization of seizures with unilateral blinking was contralateral in six patients and ipsilateral in four. When unilateral blinking was early in seizures, overall lateralization was more often contralateral (6/7 patients, PPV 85%). Ictal unilateral blinking is not infrequent but unreliable in lateralizing seizures in TSC. Unrecognized seizure propagation to contralateral symptomatogenic regions and potentially different mechanisms may account for the variable lateralization.",

The WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 1 (2007-2010) in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa is the data source. Prevalence of alcohol use / abstinence is reported by previous - day and previous - month pain. Multinomial logistic regressions (crude and adjusted for sex and country) tested associations between recent pain and alcohol use in the pooled multicountry sample. Across the six SAGE countries, about one-third of respondents reported alcohol use, being highest in Russia (74%) and lowest in India (16%). Holding the effects of sex and country constant, compared with abstainers, people with previous - day pain were more likely to be previous - day or other users. With regard to the quantity and frequency of alcohol use, people with previous - day pain were more likely to be non-heavy drinkers. Overall, we found that, in this population of older adults in six LMICs, recent pain was associated with moderate use of alcohol, although there were differences between countries. The findings provide a platform for country - specific research to better understand bi-directional associations between pain and alcohol in older adults.",
  "27473877": "Expressing sexuality in nursing homes. The experience of older women: A qualitative study In nursing homes, a number of barriers to the expression of sexuality exist, such as the lack of privacy, certain attitudes on behalf of the staff and the family, the lack of a sexual partner, and physical limitations. The aim of this study was to describe the lived experience of sexuality in elderly Spanish women residing in nursing homes. A qualitative phenomenological approach was followed. Data were collected over an 18- month period between 2013 and 2015. Purposeful sampling was conducted with Spanish residents in nursing homes in Madrid. Data were collected using unstructured and semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Twenty female residents participated. Three main themes emerged from the data: a) expressing sexuality, b) sexuality as a duty and c) respecting vows. Female residents reported key elements influencing how they manage their sexuality in Nursing Homes. These results serve to improve our understanding regarding the expression of sexuality in older female nursing home residents.",
  "27878992": "FUSCA3 interacting with LEAFY COTYLEDON2 controls lateral root formation through regulating YUCCA4 gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana Lateral root (LR) development is a post-embryonic organogenesis event that gives rise to most of the underground parts of higher plants. Auxin promotes LR formation, but the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still not well understood. We analyzed LR formation induced by FUSCA3 (FUS3), a B3 domain transcription factor, which may function by promoting auxin biosynthesis during this process. We identified FUS3 -interacting proteins that function in LR formation. In addition, we searched for the common targets of both FUS3 and its interacting protein. The role of their interactions in regulating auxin accumulation and LR initiation was examined. We identified LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) as an interacting factor of FUS3, and demonstrated that these two homologous B3 transcription factors interact to bind to the auxin biosynthesis gene YUCCA4 (YUC4) and synergistically activate its transcription during LR formation. Furthermore, FUS3 expression is activated by LEC2 in LR initiation. The observations indicate that the FUS3 - LEC2 complex functions as a key regulator in auxin -regulated LR formation. The results of this study provide new information for understanding the mechanisms of LR regulation.",

This paper aims to review the current state of knowledge on the frequency of MPAs and dermatoglyphic abnormalities in mood disorders. A MEDLINE, PsychInfo and Web of Science search was carried out to collect all publications on the frequency of MPAs and on dermatoglyphic traits in bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. 24 studies on MPAs, 19 on dermatoglyphics, and 5 dealing with both were found with discrepant findings. The relative contribution of neurodevelopmental retardation to the aetiology of affective disorders remains undetermined, the field is open for further research. Increased recognition of neurodevelopmental processes in the origin of affective disorders may allow for earlier and more effective intervention and prevention.",
  "28074211": "Safe Practices for Copy and Paste in the EHR. Systematic Review, Recommendations, and Novel Model for Health IT Collaboration Copy and paste functionality can support efficiency during clinical documentation, but may promote inaccurate documentation with risks for patient safety. The Partnership for Health IT Patient Safety was formed to gather data, conduct analysis, educate, and disseminate safe practices for safer care using health information technology (IT). To characterize copy and paste events in clinical care, identify safety risks, describe existing evidence, and develop implementable practice recommendations for safe reuse of information via copy and paste. The Partnership 1) reviewed 12 reported safety events, 2) solicited expert input, and 3) performed a systematic literature review (2010 to January 2015) to identify publications addressing frequency, perceptions / attitudes, patient safety risks, existing guidance, and potential interventions and mitigation practices. The literature review identified 51 publications that were included. Overall, 66% to 90% of clinicians routinely use copy and paste. One study of diagnostic errors found that copy and paste led to 2.6% of errors in which a missed diagnosis required patients to seek additional unplanned care. Copy and paste can promote note bloat, internal inconsistencies, error propagation, and documentation in the wrong patient chart. Existing guidance identified specific responsibilities for authors, organizations, and electronic health record (EHR) developers. Analysis of 12 reported copy and paste safety events was congruent with problems identified from the literature review. Despite regular copy and paste use, evidence regarding direct risk to patient safety remains sparse, with significant study limitations. Drawing on existing evidence, the Partnership developed four safe practice recommendations: 1) Provide a mechanism to make copy and paste material easily identifiable; 2) Ensure the provenance of copy and paste material is readily available; 3) Ensure adequate staff training and education; 4) Ensure copy and paste practices are regularly monitored, measured, and assessed.",
  "28221018": "Low Efficiency Upconversion Nanoparticles for High-Resolution Coalignment of Near-Infrared and Visible Light Paths on a Light Microscope The combination of near-infrared (NIR) and visible wavelengths in light microscopy for biological studies is increasingly common. For example, many fields of biology are developing the use of NIR for optogenetics, in which an NIR laser induces a change in gene expression and/or protein function. One major technical barrier in working with both NIR and visible light on an optical microscope is obtaining their precise coalignment at the imaging plane position. Photon upconverting particles (UCPs) can bridge this gap as they are excited by NIR light but emit in the visible range via an anti-Stokes luminescence mechanism. Here, two different UCPs have been identified, high- efficiency micro (540)- UCPs and lower efficiency nano (545)- UCPs, that respond to NIR light and emit visible light with high photostability even at very high NIR power densities (>25 000 Suns). Both of these UCPs can be rapidly and reversibly excited by visible and NIR light and emit light at visible wavelengths detectable with standard emission settings used for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a commonly used genetically encoded fluorophore. However, the high efficiency micro (540)- UCPs were suboptimal for NIR and visible light coalignment, due to their larger size and spatial broadening from particle -to- particle energy transfer consistent with a long-lived excited state and saturated power dependence. In contrast, the lower efficiency nano - UCPs were superior for precise coalignment of the NIR beam with the visible light path (∼2 μm versus ∼8 μm beam broadening, respectively) consistent with limited particle -to- particle energy transfer, superlinear power dependence for emission, and much smaller particle size. Furthermore, the nano - UCPs were superior to a traditional two- camera method for NIR and visible light path alignment in an in vivo Infrared-Laser-Evoked Gene Operator (IR-LEGO) optogenetics assay in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In summary, nano - UCPs are powerful new tools for coaligning NIR and visible light paths on a light microscope.",
  "27434112": "Phenozan, a Synthetic Phenolic Antioxidant, Inhibits the Development of Spontaneous Tumors in Rats and Mice Synthetic phenolic antioxidant β-(4-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl) propionic acid, named phenozan, is a potential antiepileptic drug. In pre-clinical trials this substance did not manifest any toxicity, and also inhibited the development of some spontaneous tumors in animals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate inhibiting effect of phenozan on spontaneous carcinogenesis in rats and mice. In experiments with rats LIO and mice SHR of local breeding, with high spontaneous tumor incidence, phenozan was dissolved in sunflower oil and administered by gavage in therapeutic dose 5 mg/kg 3 times per week for 18 months. There were no any signs of toxicity and differences in weight of animals during the phenozan treatment compared with the control (sunflower oil). Phenozan significantly reduced the overall incidence and multiplicity of all tumors but only multiplicity of malignant tumors, compared with the control. Moreover a significant decrease of overall incidence and multiplicity was observed in pituitary and breast tumors in females and only overall multiplicity of tumors of pituitary and lymphoid tissue in males. In mice phenozan reduced overall incidence and multiplicity of lung tumors (in females) and also overall multiplicity of all tumors (in females) and only malignant tumors (in males). These findings allow us to classify phenozan as anticarcinogenic agent. Anticarcinogenic activity of phenozan is important because clinical study of this drug as the possible antiepileptic drug goes along and it is known that such drugs are designed for long-term use.",
  "28381379": "Clinical outcomes of ERCP -related retroperitoneal perforations Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-related perforations represent rare but often severe conditions. While lesions with intraperitoneal perforation have an almost imperative indication to surgery, whether or not to manage retroperitoneal perforations surgically is still an area of debate. The aim of the present work was to review the available clinical evidence on the operatively and medically treated ERCP -related retroperitoneal perforations. From MEDLINE / PubMed databases 137 patients with retroperitoneal perforation were included from 12 studies that met the selection criteria for data investigation and analysis. Twenty-four patients were treated by prompt surgery; 113 were primarily managed conservatively and about 20% of these patients required surgery subsequently. Overall, the morbidity and mortality were 15.4% and 6.6%, respectively. Although most patients with retroperitoneal perforation may benefit from a non-operative management, a considerable number of patients fail to respond to medical treatment and require surgery afterwards. Identifying those patients who are at highest risk of poor outcome after conservative treatment should be considered a research priority.",
  "28167866": "The Role of Metal-on-Metal Bearings in Total Hip Arthroplasty and Hip Resurfacing: Review Article The current role of metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings in hip arthroplasty remains controversial. The low wear offered by MoM bearings compared to metal-on-polyethylene and the possibility of a lower risk of dislocation with larger head sizes, encouraged a trend towards the re-introduction of the MoM bearing couple. However, recent evidence has shown that not all designs of the MoM bearing have been successful. The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on the use of MoM bearings and address the following issues: (1) the reintroduction of metal-on-metal bearings in total hip arthroplasty, (2) the failure of metal-on-metal bearings in stemmed total hip arthroplasty, (3) the role of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing in modern orthopaedics and (4) metal-on-metal hip resurfacing versus total hip arthroplasty. A literature search strategy was conducted using various search terms in MEDLINE and Embase. The highest quality articles that met the inclusion criteria and best answered the topics of focus of this review were selected. Key search terms included ' metal-on-metal ', ' total hip arthroplasty ' and ' hip resurfacing '. The initial search retrieved 1240 articles. Twenty-two articles were selected and used in the review. Metal-on-metal hip resurfacing is still a suitable treatment option in specific patient populations with the appropriate implant design and surgical skill, while stemmed metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty should be avoided in all patient populations. Continued follow-up of patients undergoing metal-on-metal hip resurfacing is critical in order to further understand the long-term outcomes of these patients and why certain complications tend to occur with this procedure.",
  "28103582": "AMPK - autophagy inhibition sensitizes icaritin - induced anti-colorectal cancer cell activity The current research studied the potential effect of autophagy on icaritin - induced anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) cell activity. Treatment of icaritin in both primary and established (HT-29) CRC cells induced feedback activation of autophagy, evidenced by p62 degradation, Beclin-1 and autophagy-related gene-5 (ATG-5) upregulation, as well as light chain 3B (LC3B)- GFP puncta formation. Pharmacological inhibiting of autophagy dramatically potentiated icaritin - induced CRC cell death and apoptosis. Meanwhile, shRNA -mediated knockdown of Beclin-1 or ATG-5 also sensitized icaritin - induced CRC cell death and apoptosis. Icaritin activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in CRC cells, functioning as the upstream signaling for autophagy activation. shRNA / siRNA -mediated knockdown of AMPKα1 inhibited icaritin - induced autophagy activation, but exacerbated CRC cell death. On the other hand, the AMPK activator compound 13 (C13) or the autophagy activator MHY1485 attenuated icaritin - induced cytotoxicity. In nude mice, icaritin (oral administration)- induced HT-29 tumor growth inhibition was potentiated when combined with AMPKα1 shRNA knockdown in tumors. We conclude that feedback activation of AMPK - autophagy pathway could be a primary resistance factor of icaritin.",

Moreover, light - inducible systems provide fast and reversible means for spatiotemporal control of gene expression. Here, in HEK 293 cells, we present combinatory genetic circuits responding to light and chemical signals, simultaneously. We first constructed a dual input circuit converting different light intensities into varying of the sensitivity of the promoter to a chemical inducer (doxycycline). Next, we generated a ternary input circuit, which responded to light, doxycycline and cumate. This circuit allowed us to use different combinations of blue light and the two chemical inducers to generate gradual output values over two orders of magnitude. Overall, in this study, we devise genetic circuits sensing and processing light and chemical inducers. Our work may provide insights into bio-computation and fine-tuning expression of the transgene.",

Professionals from different disciplines collaborate and coordinate care to deal with the complex health care needs. There is lack of information on current practices regarding interprofessional team (IPT) meetings. This study aimed to improve our understanding of the process of interprofessional collaboration in primary care team meetings in the Netherlands by observing the current practice and exploring personal opinions. Qualitative study involving observations of team meeting s and interviews with participants. Eight different IPT meetings (n = 8) in different primary care practices were observed by means of video recordings. Experiences were explored by conducting individual semi-structured interviews (n = 60) with participants (i.e. health care professionals from different disciplines) of the observed team meetings. The data were analysed by means of content analysis. Most participants expressed favourable opinions about their team meetings. However, observations showed that team meetings were more or less hectic, and lacked a clear structure and team coordinator or leader. There appears to be a discrepancy between findings from observations and interviews. From the interviews, four main themes were extracted: (1) Team structure and composition, (2) Patient-centredness, (3) Interaction and (4) Attitude and motivation. IPT meetings could benefit from improvements in structure, patient-centredness and leadership by the chairpersons. Given the discrepancy between observations and interviews, it would appear useful to improve team members ' awareness of aspects that could be improved before training them in dealing with specific challenges.",
  "27655704": "Poorer breast cancer survival outcomes in males than females might be attributable to tumor subtype Substantial controversy exists regarding the differences in tumor subtypes between male breast cancer (MBC) and female breast cancer (FBC). This is the largest population-based study to compare MBC and FBC patients. Using data obtained by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from 2010-2012, a retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted to investigate tumor subtype - specific differences in various characteristics, overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) between males and females. In all, 181,814 BC patients (1,516 male and 180,298 female) were eligible for this study. The male patients were more likely to be black, older, and have lower histological grades, more advanced stages, larger tumors, more lymph node and distant metastases and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- negative tumors (each p<0.05). A matched analysis showed that the 2-year OS was 91.2% and 93.7% and that the BCSM was 2.2% and 2.5% for male and female patients, respectively. The univariate analysis showed that male triple-negative (TN), hormone receptor (HoR)-positive/HER2-positive and HoR-positive/HER2-negative patients had poorer OS (p <0.01). Meanwhile, the HoR-positive/HER2-positive and TN subtypes were associated with a higher BCSM in MBC patients (p<0.01). The multivariate analysis revealed that TN MBC patients had poorer OS and BCSM (p<0.05). Simultaneously, the results showed that male patients in the HoR-positive/HER2-negative subgroup were less likely to die of BC when adjusting for other factors (p<0.05). The analysis of 2-year OS and BCSM among the BC subtypes showed clear differences between MBC and FBC patients with the TN subtype; these differences warrant further investigation.",

It obtains projection vectors by greedy strategy, i.e., all projection vectors are optimized individually through maximizing the objective function. Thus, the obtained solution does not necessarily best optimize the corresponding trace ratio optimization algorithm, which is the essential objective function for general dimensionality reduction. It results in insufficient recognition accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose a nongreedy algorithm to solve the trace ratio formula of DLPP-L1, and analyze its convergence.

  "28132389": "An Improved Method for Identifying Specific DNA-Protein-Binding Sites In Vitro Binding of proteins to specific DNA sequences is essential for a variety of cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription and responses to external stimuli. Chromatin immunoprecipitation is widely used for determining intracellular DNA fragments bound by a specific protein. However, the subsequent specific or accurate DNA-protein-binding sequence is usually determined by DNA footprinting. Here, we report an alternative method for identifying specific sites of DNA-protein-binding (designated SSDP) in vitro. This technique is mainly dependent on antibody-antigen immunity, simple and convenient, while radioactive isotope labeling and optimization of partial degradation by deoxyribonuclease (DNase) are avoided. As an example, the specific binding sequence of a target promoter by DdrO (a DNA damage response protein from Deinococcus radiodurans) in vitro was determined by the developed method. The central sequence of the binding site could be easily located using this technique.",
  "28381880": "20S immunoproteasomes remove formaldehyde - damaged cytoplasmic proteins suppressing caspase-independent cell death Immunoproteasomes are known for their involvement in antigen presentation. However, their broad tissue presence and other evidence are indicative of nonimmune functions. We examined a role for immunoproteasomes in cellular responses to the endogenous and environmental carcinogen formaldehyde (FA) that binds to cytosolic and nuclear proteins producing proteotoxic stress and genotoxic DNA - histone crosslinks. We found that immunoproteasomes were important for suppression of a caspase-independent cell death and the long-term survival of FA-treated cells. All major genotoxic responses to FA, including replication inhibition and activation of the transcription factor p53 and the apical ATM and ATR kinases, were unaffected by immunoproteasome inactivity. Immunoproteasome inhibition enhanced activation of the cytosolic protein damage sensor HSF1, elevated levels of K48-polyubiquitinated cytoplasmic proteins and increased depletion of unconjugated ubiquitin. We further found that FA induced the disassembly of 26S immunoproteasomes, but not standard 26S proteasomes, releasing the 20S catalytic immunoproteasome. FA-treated cells also had higher amounts of small activators PA28αβ and PA28γ bound to 20S particles. Our findings highlight the significance of nonnuclear damage in FA injury and reveal a major role for immunoproteasomes in elimination of FA-damaged cytoplasmic proteins through ubiquitin - independent proteolysis.",
  "27451448": "Yersinia ruckeri Isolates Recovered from Diseased Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) in Scotland Are More Diverse than Those from Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Represent Distinct Subpopulations Yersinia ruckeri is the etiological agent of enteric redmouth (ERM) disease of farmed salmonids. Enteric redmouth disease is traditionally associated with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum), but its incidence in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is increasing. Yersinia ruckeri isolates recovered from diseased Atlantic salmon have been poorly characterized, and very little is known about the relationship of the isolates associated with these two species. Phenotypic approaches were used to characterize 109 Y. ruckeri isolates recovered over a 14-year period from infected Atlantic salmon in Scotland; 26 isolates from infected rainbow trout were also characterized. Biotyping, serotyping, and comparison of outer membrane protein profiles identified 19 Y. ruckeri clones associated with Atlantic salmon but only five associated with rainbow trout; none of the Atlantic salmon clones occurred in rainbow trout and vice versa These findings suggest that distinct subpopulations of Y. ruckeri are associated with each species. A new O serotype (designated O8) was identified in 56 biotype 1 Atlantic salmon isolates and was the most common serotype identified from 2006 to 2011 and in 2014, suggesting an increased prevalence during the time period sampled. Rainbow trout isolates were represented almost exclusively by the same biotype 2, serotype O1 clone that has been responsible for the majority of ERM outbreaks in this species within the United Kingdom since the 1980s. However, the identification of two biotype 2, serotype O8 isolates in rainbow trout suggests that vaccines containing serotypes O1 and O8 should be evaluated in both rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon for application in Scotland. Vaccination plays an important role in protecting Atlantic salmon against the bacterial pathogen Yersinia ruckeri, but, in recent years, there has been an increasing incidence of vaccine breakdown in salmon. This is largely because current vaccines are aimed at rainbow trout and are based on serotypes specific for this species. A wider range of serotypes is responsible for infection in Atlantic salmon, but very little is known about the diversity of these strains and their relationships to those recovered from rainbow trout. In the present study, we demonstrate that Y. ruckeri isolates recovered from diseased Atlantic salmon in Scotland are more diverse than those from rainbow trout; furthermore, isolates from the two species represent distinct subpopulations. In addition, a new O serotype was identified that is responsible for a significant proportion of the disease in Atlantic salmon. Our findings are likely to have important implications for the development of improved vaccines against Y. ruckeri.",

Between May 2009 and November 2012, this open-label, randomized, crossover study enrolled 26 men suffering with RE at Department of Reproductive Medicine, Omori Hospital. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (n=13 each). The amoxapine - B12 group received amoxapine (50 mg daily for 4 weeks, orally) followed (after a 1- week washout period) by vitamin B12 (500 μg three-times daily for 4 weeks). The B12 - amoxapine group received the opposite regimen. All pa-tients masturbated to ejaculation at least twice during each treatment period. The primary outcome was antegrade ejaculation of semen, as reported by the patient, on more than one occasion during either treatment period (defined as treatment success). Any adverse events were noted. Success rates were compared between treatments using Fisher's exact test. One patient (B12 - amoxapine group) withdrew for personal reasons (breakdown of marital relations); all other patients completed the study. Overall success rate was 88% (22/25). Success rate was higher for amoxapine than for vitamin B12 (80%, 20/25 vs 16%, 4/25; P<0.0001). 18 patients were responsive to amoxapine but not to vitamin B12, 2 patients were responsive to vitamin B12 but not amoxapine, 2 patients were responsive to both drugs, and 3 patients had no response to either drug. One patient (4%) reported sleepiness and 2 (8%) reported constipation while receiving amoxapine. No adverse events were reported during vitamin B12 treatment. Amoxapine may be an effective, safe and well-tolerated therapy for RE.",

The aims of this study were (1) to investigate defecation habits and (2) to examine the prevalence of constipation using the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine (JSIM) and the Rome III criteria using an online survey. An online questionnaire composed of items on the frequency, interval, form of defecation, the management, and self-recognition of constipation (reference standard of constipation) was created. A total of 5155 valid responses were received. In addition, constipation symptoms were evaluated through a survey using the JSIM and the Rome III criteria. In the internet survey, 28.4% of the respondents considered themselves to be constipated. Stratified by sex, significantly more females (37.5%) than males (19.1%) considered themselves to be constipated (P < 0.001). The prevalence of constipation among the respondents was 28.0% using the Rome III, but only 10.1% using the JSIM. The diagnostic accuracy was 73.2% for the Rome III and 78.1% for the JSIM, while the diagnostic specificity was 81.1% for the Rome III and 97.5% for the JSIM. However, the diagnostic sensitivities for both measures were low, at 52.2% and 29.2% for the Rome III and the JSIM, respectively. The online survey developed for this study was able to provide clarification regarding defecation patterns. The results also suggest a discrepancy between the self-recognized prevalence of constipation in Japan and prevalence of constipation based on the JSIM criteria.",

Being airborne or soilborne, the cosmopolitan nature of mycotoxigenic fungi contribute to the worldwide occurrence of mycotoxins. On the basis of the global occurrence data reported during the past 10 years, the incidences and maximum levels in raw cereal grains were 55% and 1642 μg/kg for aflatoxins, 29% and 1164 μg/kg for ochratoxin A, 61% and 71,121 μg/kg for fumonisins, 58% and 41,157 μg/kg, for deoxynivalenol, and 46% and 3049 μg/kg for zearalenone. The concentrations of mycotoxins tend to be lower in processed food products; the incidences varied depending on the individual mycotoxins, possibly due to the varying stability during processing and distribution of mycotoxins. It should be noted that more than one mycotoxin, produced by a single or several fungal species, may occur in various combinations in a given sample or food. Most studies reported additive or synergistic effects, suggesting that these mixtures may pose a significant threat to public health, particularly to infants and young children. Therefore, information on the co-occurrence of mycotoxins and their interactive toxicity is summarized in this paper.",
  "27760149": "BEST: Next-Generation Biomedical Entity Search Tool for Knowledge Discovery from Biomedical Literature As the volume of publications rapidly increases, searching for relevant information from the literature becomes more challenging. To complement standard search engines such as PubMed, it is desirable to have an advanced search tool that directly returns relevant biomedical entities such as targets, drugs, and mutations rather than a long list of articles. Some existing tools submit a query to PubMed and process retrieved abstracts to extract information at query time, resulting in a slow response time and limited coverage of only a fraction of the PubMed corpus. Other tools preprocess the PubMed corpus to speed up the response time; however, they are not constantly updated, and thus produce outdated results. Further, most existing tools cannot process sophisticated queries such as searches for mutations that co-occur with query terms in the literature. To address these problems, we introduce BEST, a biomedical entity search tool. BEST returns, as a result, a list of 10 different types of biomedical entities including genes, diseases, drugs, targets, transcription factors, miRNAs, and mutations that are relevant to a user's query. To the best of our knowledge, BEST is the only system that processes free text queries and returns up-to-date results in real time including mutation information in the results. BEST is freely accessible at http://best.korea.ac.kr.",
  "28540536": "Effects of robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis Technology-supported training is emerging as a solution to support therapists in their efforts providing high-intensity, repetitive, and task-specific treatment, in order to enhance the recovery process. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of different robotic devices (end-effector and exoskeleton robots) in comparison with any other type of intervention. Furthermore, we aim to assess whether or not better improvements are obtained in the sub-acute phase after stroke onset than in the chronic phase. A research was conducted in the electronic bibliographic databases Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. A total of 17 studies were included: 14 randomized controlled trials, 2 systematic reviews, and one meta-analysis. Fugl-Meyer and modified Ashworth scale were selected to measure primary outcomes, i.e., motor function and muscle tone. Functional independence measure and motor activity log were selected to measure secondary outcomes, i.e., activities of daily living. In comparison with conventional therapy, the robot-assisted rehabilitation is more effective in improving upper limb motor function recovery, especially in chronic stroke patients. No significant improvements are observed in the reduction of muscle tone or daily living activities. The present systematic review shows that the use of robotic devices can positively affect the recovery of arm function in patients with stroke.",
  "27550556": "Examining the relationship between home literacy environment and neural correlates of phonological processing in beginning readers with and without a familial risk for dyslexia: an fMRI study Developmental dyslexia is a language - based learning disability characterized by persistent difficulty in learning to read. While an understanding of genetic contributions is emerging, the ways the environment affects brain functioning in children with developmental dyslexia are poorly understood. A relationship between the home literacy environment (HLE) and neural correlates of reading has been identified in typically developing children, yet it remains unclear whether similar effects are observable in children with a genetic predisposition for dyslexia. Understanding environmental contributions is important given that we do not understand why some genetically at-risk children do not develop dyslexia. Here, we investigate for the first time the relationship between HLE and the neural correlates of phonological processing in beginning readers with (FHD+, n = 29) and without (FHD-, n = 21) a family history of developmental dyslexia. We further controlled for socioeconomic status to isolate the neurobiological mechanism by which HLE affects reading development. Group differences revealed stronger correlation of HLE with brain activation in the left inferior / middle frontal and right fusiform gyri in FHD- compared to FHD+ children, suggesting greater impact of HLE on manipulation of phonological codes and recruitment of orthographic representations in typically developing children. In contrast, activation in the right precentral gyrus showed a significantly stronger correlation with HLE in FHD+ compared to FHD- children, suggesting emerging compensatory networks in genetically at-risk children. Overall, our results suggest that genetic predisposition for dyslexia alters contributions of HLE to early reading skills before formal reading instruction, which has important implications for educational practice and intervention models.",
  "27801735": "Fading With Time of PD-L1 Immunoreactivity in Non-Small Cells Lung Cancer Tissues: A Methodological Study Blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints is currently arising as a potential immunologic option for tumor therapy. Inhibition of programmed cell death protein 1 and/or its specific ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was effective in clinical trials in advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) bladder and kidney cancer. The predictive role of the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PD-L1 is highly debated. Different reagents, clones, cutoffs of cell expression and subjective interpretation of PD-L1 immunoreactivity in epithelial cells and lymphocytes are the main issue. In this study we selected 58 consecutive NSCLC surgical specimens that underwent pathologic examination from January 2014 to July 2015. Using a tissue microarray approach we evaluated the IHC expression of PD-L1 in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor cells (TCs) and compared the ICH staining with tumor histology, grade and the age of the tissue blocks. The main new finding was the fading of PD-L1 IHC expression in TCs in tissues processed in 2014 compared with 2015. PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the 2 years was similar. We also found a significant higher immunoreactivity of TCs in high grade NSCLC and in the squamous carcinoma histotype compared with low grade tumors and the adenocarcinoma histology (P=0.013). We demonstrated that the IHC evaluation of PD-L1 in NSCLC archival tissues is feasible and can be implemented in a routine pathology setting, but it should be carefully assessed in tissue blocks older than 1 year.",
  "28509710": "Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis: a novel parasternal approach The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel pericardiocentesis technique using an in-plane parasternal medial -to- lateral approach with the use of a high-frequency probe in patients with cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography is pivotal in the diagnosis of pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. Ultrasound guidance for pericardiocentesis is currently considered the standard of care. Several approaches have been described recently, which differ mainly on the site of puncture (subxiphoid, apical, or parasternal). Although they share the use of low-frequency probes, there is absence of complete control of needle trajectory and real-time needle visualization. An in-plane and real-time technique has only been described anecdotally. A retrospective analysis of 11 patients (63% men, mean age: 37.7±21.2 years) presenting with cardiac tamponade admitted to the tertiary-care emergency department and treated with parasternal medial-to-lateral in-plane pericardiocentesis was carried out. The underlying causes of cardiac tamponade were different among the population. All the pericardiocentesis were successfully performed in the emergency department, without complications, relieving the hemodynamic instability. The mean time taken to perform the eight- step procedure was 309±76.4 s, with no procedure-related complications. The parasternal medial-to-lateral in-plane pericardiocentesis is a new technique theoretically free of complications and it enables real-time monitoring of needle trajectory. For the first time, a pericardiocentesis approach with a medial-to-lateral needle trajectory and real-time, in-plane, needle visualization was performed in a tamponade patient population .This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

  "28473015": "MESOTHELIAL CELL ADHERENCE TO VASCULAR PROSTHESES AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT GROWTH IN VITRO Cell seeding may decrease the thrombogenicity of implanted vascular grafts, but its application is hampered by the limited availability of autologous endothelial cells. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells have blood flow supporting qualities and are readily available. This study investigated the adherence of mesothelial cells to vascular prostheses and their subsequent growth in vitro. Circular pieces of various vascular prosthetic materials were seeded with 51Chromium-labeled mesothelial and endothelial cells and left for either 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. The unattached cells were removed and the degree of cell attachment was measured. The number of mesothelial cells to Dacron increased during the first 60 min up to 35.2 % of the seeded inoculum where after a plateau was reached. Scanning electron microscopy showed spreaded mesothelial cells adherent to the Dacron fibers. A significant increase in adherence was observed after preincubation of Dacron with 10 μg/mL fibronectin, but no improvement was found after preincubation with human serum albumin or gelatin. Mesothelial cells adhered better to Gelcoated than to Gelsealed or plain Dacron. The adherence of mesothelial cells to ePTFE (Teflon) was significantly poorer. No significant differences in adherence were found between mesothelial and endothelial cells. Mesothelial cell growth on Dacron resulted in a modest increase in the number of viable cells during 27 days, which implies biocompatibility of Dacron and mesothelial cells in vitro.",
  "27395784": "Lateral hypothalamus orexinergic system modulates the stress effect on pentylenetetrazol induced seizures through corticotropin releasing hormone receptor type 1 Stress is a trigger factor for seizure initiation which activates hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis as well other brain areas. In this respect, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and lateral hypothalamus (LH) orexinergic system are involved in seizure occurrence. In this study, we investigated the role of LH area and orexin expression in (mediation of) stress effect on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) - induced seizures with hippocampal involvement. Two mild foot shock stresses were applied to intact and adrenalectomized animals; with or without CRHr1 blocking (NBI 27914) in the LH area. Then, changes in orexin production were evaluated by RT-PCR. Intravenous PTZ infusion (25 mg/ml) - induced convulsions were scored upon modified Racine scale. Finally, hippocampal glutamate and GABA were evaluated to study excitability changes. We demonstrated that the duration and severity of convulsions in stress - induced as well as adrenalectomized group were increased. Plasma corticosterone (CRT) level and orexin mRNA expression were built up in the stress and/or seizure groups. Furthermore, glutamate and GABA content was increased and decreased respectively due to stress and seizures. In contrast, rats receiving CRHr1 inhibitor showed reduced severity and duration of seizures, increased GABA, decreased glutamate and corticosterone and also orexin mRNA compared to the inhibitor free rats. Stress and adrenalectomy induced augmenting effect on seizure severity and duration and the subsequent reduction due to CRHr1 blocking with parallel orexin mRNA changes, indicated the likely involvement of CRH1r induced orexin expression of the LH in gating stress effect on convulsions.",

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available data on NOM, with the intention of formulating standardized protocols on which to base future investigations. A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted. A highly sensitive literature search identified all relevant studies published between January 2004 and December 2016. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed independently by two authors, and resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. In total, 15 studies, including 920 patients, met the inclusion criteria; 575 (62.5%) of these patients underwent NOM after cCR, with the remaining patients forming a surgical control group. The weighted mean follow-up was 39.4 (12.7) months in the NOM group and 39.8 (5.1) months in the surgery group. The pooled regrowth rate in the NOM group was 21.3% at a mean of 15.6 (7.0) months. Surgical salvage was possible and was undertaken in 93.2% of these patients. Overall survival in the NOM group was 91.7%, while disease-free survival was 82.7%. For the comparison proctectomy group, pooled rates of local recurrence, overall survival, and disease-free survival were 8.4, 92.4, and 87.5%, respectively. NOM may be a feasible option for surgically eligible rectal cancer patients with cCR after nCRT. Before such a strategy can be widely implemented, further prospective data are required with standardized definitions, diagnostic criteria, and management protocols, with an emphasis on shared patient-provider decision making and patient-centered outcomes.",
  "27456062": "Somatic Therapy of a Mouse SMA Model with a U7 snRNA Gene Correcting SMN2 Splicing Spinal Muscular Atrophy is due to the loss of SMN1 gene function. The duplicate gene SMN2 produces some, but not enough, SMN protein because most transcripts lack exon 7. Thus, promoting the inclusion of this exon is a therapeutic option. We show that a somatic gene therapy using the gene for a modified U7 RNA which stimulates this splicing has a profound and persistent therapeutic effect on the phenotype of a severe Spinal Muscular Atrophy mouse model. To this end, the U7 gene and vector and the production of pure, highly concentrated self-complementary (sc) adenovirus - associated virus 9 vector particles were optimized. Introduction of the functional vector into motoneurons of newborn Spinal Muscular Atrophy mice by intracerebroventricular injection led to a highly significant, dose-dependent increase in life span and improvement of muscle functions. Besides the central nervous system, the therapeutic U7 RNA was expressed in the heart and liver which may additionally have contributed to the observed therapeutic efficacy. This approach provides an additional therapeutic option for Spinal Muscular Atrophy and could also be adapted to treat other diseases of the central nervous system with regulatory small RNA genes.",
  "27454738": "Co-ChIP enables genome-wide mapping of histone mark co-occurrence at single-molecule resolution Histone modifications play an important role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation, but despite the large amount of genome-wide histone modification data collected in different cells and tissues, little is known about co-occurrence of modifications on the same nucleosome. Here we present a genome-wide quantitative method for combinatorial indexed chromatin immunoprecipitation (co-ChIP) to characterize co-occurrence of histone modifications on nucleosomes. Using co-ChIP, we study the genome-wide co-occurrence of 14 chromatin marks (70 pairwise combinations), and find previously undescribed co-occurrence patterns, including the co-occurrence of H3K9me1 and H3K27ac in super-enhancers. Finally, we apply co-ChIP to measure the distribution of the bivalent H3K4me3 - H3K27me3 domains in two distinct mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) states and in four adult tissues. We observe dynamic changes in 5,786 regions and discover both loss and de novo gain of bivalency in key tissue-specific regulatory genes, suggesting a functional role for bivalent domains during different stages of development. These results show that co-ChIP can reveal the complex interactions between histone modifications.",
  "27984052": "Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockers in Hypertension: Alive and Well Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (β-blockers) are an appropriate treatment for patients having systemic hypertension (HTN) who have concomitant ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure, obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection or certain cardiac arrhythmias. β-Blockers can be used in combination with other antiHTN drugs to achieve maximal blood pressure control. Labetalol can be used in HTN emergencies and urgencies. β-Blockers may be useful in HTN patients having a hyperkinetic circulation (palpitations, tachycardia, HTN, and anxiety), migraine headache, and essential tremor. β-Blockers are highly heterogeneous with respect to various pharmacologic properties: degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, membrane stabilizing activity, β1 selectivity, α1-adrenergic blocking effects, tissue solubility, routes of systemic elimination, potencies and duration of action, and specific properties may be important in the selection of a drug for clinical use. β-Blocker usage to reduce perioperative myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular (CV) complications may not benefit as many patients as was once hoped, and may actually cause harm in some individuals. Currently the best evidence supports perioperative β-blocker use in two patient groups: patients undergoing vascular surgery with known IHD or multiple risk factors for it, and for those patients already receiving β-blockers for known CV conditions.",
  "27795701": "Targeted therapy in gastric cancer Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide. Surgery in combination with multimodal therapy provides the only curative therapy until now. The importance of targeted therapy became clear over the last few years. Due to the implication of HER2 and angiogenesis -directed targeted therapies major advances in the treatment of gastric cancer could be reached. Nevertheless, benefits in survival remain unsatisfactory and the development of resistance to monoclonal antibodies is arising. A comprehensive and comparative literature research was performed to evaluate the status of HER2 and angiogenesis -directed targeted therapy in gastric cancer. Up to now, trastuzumab and ramucirumab are the only agents showing remarkable benefits in the therapy for the patients suffering from gastric cancer. The limitations of targeted therapies in gastric cancer are mainly associated with the development of secondary resistance. Addition of targeted therapy in second-line treatment is beneficial when compared with chemotherapy alone. Nevertheless, results in first-line treatment remain modest. Therefore, new therapeutic agents and combinations in the first-line treatment of gastric cancer are urgently needed and remain to be validated in clinical trials.",

Multiple groups demonstrated α-syn accumulation in CNS accessory structures, including the eyes and olfactory terminals, as well as in peripheral organs of Parkinsonian patients. Retinal imaging studies of mice overexpressing fused α-syn :: GFP were conducted to evaluate the presence and progression of retinal pathology in a PD / DLB transgenic mouse model. Bright-field image retinal maps and fluorescent images were acquired at 1-month intervals for 3 months. Retinal imaging revealed the accumulation of GFP -tagged α-syn in retinal ganglion cell layer and in the edges of arterial blood vessels in the transgenic mice. Double labeling studies confirmed that the α-syn :: GFP -positive cells were retinal ganglion cells containing α-syn. Accumulation of α-syn persisted in the same cells and increased with age. Accumulation of α-syn :: GFP was reduced by immunization with single chain antibodies against α-syn. In conclusion, longitudinal live imaging of the retina in the PDGF - α-syn :: GFP mice might represent a useful, non-invasive tool to monitor the fate of α-syn accumulation in the CNS and to evaluate the therapeutic effects of compounds targeting α-syn.",
  "28266689": "Local induction of inflammation affects bone formation To explore the influence of inflammatory processes on bone formation, we applied a new in vivo screening model. Confined biological pockets were first created in rabbits as a response to implanted bone cement discs. These biomembrane pockets were subsequently used to study the effects of inflammatory stimuli on ectopic bone formation within biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) constructs loaded with TNF-α, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), all with or without bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2. Analysis of bone formation after 12 weeks demonstrated that the inflammatory mediators were not bone - inductive in combination with the BCP alone, but inhibited or enhanced BMP -induced bone formation. LPS was associated with a strong inhibition of bone formation by BMP-2, while LTA and TNF-α showed a positive interaction with BMP-2. Since the biomembrane pockets did not interfere with bone formation and prevented the leakage of pro-inflammatory compounds to the surrounding tissue, the biomembrane model can be used for in vivo approaches to study local inflammation in conjunction with new bone formation. Using this model, it was shown that the modulation of the inflammatory response could be beneficial or detrimental to the subsequent bone formation process. The co-delivery of inflammatory factors and bone -related growth factors should be further explored as a strategy to enhance the bone-forming efficacy of bone substitutes.",

RNA-seq data of READ were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Differential analysis was performed with package edgeR. False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and |log2 (fold change)|>1 were set as cut-off values to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene coexpression network was constructed with package Ebcoexpress. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed for the DEGs in the gene coexpression network with DAVID online tool. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis was also performed for the genes with KOBASS 2.0. A total of 620 DEGs, 3ated genes, and 231 down-regulated genes, were identified from 163 READ samples and 9 normal controls. A gene coexpression network consisting of 71 DEGs and 253 edges were constructed. Genes were associated with ribosome and focal adhesion functions. Three modules were identified, in which genes were involved in muscle contraction, negative regulation of glial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix organization functions, respectively. Several critical hub genes were disclosed, such as RPS2, MMP1, MMP11 and FAM83H. Thirteen relevant small molecule drugs were identified, such as scriptaid and spaglumic acid. A total of 8 TFs and 5 miRNAs were acquired, such as MYC, NFY, STAT5A, miR-29, miR-200 and miR-19. Several critical genes and relevant drugs, TFs and miRNAs were revealed in READ.

  "27478387": "Amphetamine Withdrawal Differentially Increases the Expression of Organic Cation Transporter 3 and Serotonin Transporter in Limbic Brain Regions Amphetamine withdrawal increases anxiety and stress sensitivity related to blunted ventral hippocampus (vHipp) and enhances the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) serotonin responses. Extracellular serotonin levels are regulated by the serotonin transporter (SERT) and organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), and vHipp OCT3 expression is enhanced during 24 hours of amphetamine withdrawal, while SERT expression is unaltered. Here, we tested whether OCT3 and SERT expression in the CeA is also affected during acute withdrawal to explain opposing regional alterations in limbic serotonergic neurotransmission and if respective changes continued with two weeks of withdrawal. We also determined whether changes in transporter expression were confined to these regions. Male rats received amphetamine or saline for two weeks followed by 24 hours or two weeks of withdrawal, with transporter expression measured using Western immunoblot. OCT3 and SERT expression increased in the CeA at both withdrawal timepoints. In the vHipp, OCT3 expression increased only at 24 hours of withdrawal, with an equivalent pattern seen in the dorsomedial hypothalamus. No changes were evident in any other regions sampled. These regionally specific changes in limbic OCT3 and SERT expression may partially contribute to the serotonergic imbalance and negative affect during amphetamine withdrawal.",

Atrioventricular dissociation (including fusion / capture beats and partial dissociation) was assigned two points. We recommend ≥3 VT score points for a firm diagnosis of VT. A cut-off ≥1 point can be used for diagnosis of VT when highest overall accuracy rather than error - free diagnosis is desired. However, in case of VT score of 0-2 (i.e., not fully diagnostic ECG), we recommend using other options (electrophysiological study, clinical data, previous and following ECGs, etc.) for confirming the diagnosis.",
  "27348285": "Economic Burden of Illness Among Patients with Severe Asthma in a Managed Care Setting Despite intensive pharmacotherapy, a considerable number of patients with severe asthma have inadequate disease control. Patients with severe asthma who experience exacerbations consume significant health care resources. To assess health care resource utilization and associated costs among patients with persistent severe asthma who experienced exacerbations compared with patients with persistent but nonsevere asthma. This retrospective analysis of a national administrative claims database identified patients aged ≥ 12 years who had at least 1 medical claim with an asthma diagnosis in 2012 and had continuous medical and pharmacy coverage under a commercial or Medicare Advantage plan from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013. Patients were assigned to 1 of 2 mutually exclusive cohorts - persistent asthma (PA) or severe asthma (SA)-according to an established algorithm based on asthma -related health care resource use and pharmacy claims for controller medication. SA patients were required to meet PA criteria and also have evidence of ≥2 asthma exacerbations in 2012. Asthma -related health care resource utilization and costs were computed from asthma medication use (rescue and controller therapy) and medical claims with an asthma diagnosis in the primary position in 2012 and 2013. Adherence to controller therapy was assessed over 365 days by using the proportion of days covered (PDC), starting with the first claim for controller therapy in 2012. Differences between the PA and SA cohorts were analyzed by t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Asthma -related costs in 2013 were also analyzed using a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log link, adjusted for patient demographics (age, gender, region, and insurance type) and Quan-Charlson comorbidity score. A total of 65,359 patients were included: 63,597 (97.3%) PA patients and 1,762 SA patients (2.7%). Compared with the PA cohort, the SA cohort was older (mean age = 50.8 years vs. 46.5 years, P < 0.001) and had higher mean comorbidity score (1.47 vs. 1.31, P< 0.001). The mean count of all asthma medications fills was 2.2-fold (2012) and 2.1-fold (2013) higher in the SA cohort, compared with the PA cohort (P< 0.001). Mean PDC for all oral and inhaled controller therapy was also higher in the SA cohort compared with the PA cohort (0.80 vs. 0.65, P< 0.001). SA patients had a significantly greater mean count of asthma -related hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and ambulatory visits in 2012 and 2013 (P< 0.001). Unadjusted mean annual asthma -related costs in the SA versus PA cohorts were $6,496 versus $2,739 (P < 0.001) in 2012 and $5,174 versus $1,775 (P< 0.001) in 2013. Higher asthma -related costs were driven by greater mean annual asthma medication costs in 2012 ($4,545 vs. $1,738, P< 0.001) and 2013 ($4,068 vs. $1,348, P< 0.001). Adjusted mean annual asthma -related costs in 2013 were $3,336 greater (cost ratio =2.878, P< 0.001) in the SA cohort, and adjusted mean annual asthma medication costs were $2,672 higher (cost ratio=2.982, P< 0.001) in the SA cohort. Patients with SA who experienced 2 or more exacerbations had 2.1-fold greater use of controller medications across both study years and were more adherent to controller therapy than patients with PA. Despite more intensive pharmacotherapy, SA patients incurred 2.9-fold higher adjusted asthma -related costs and 3-fold higher adjusted asthma medication costs than PA patients. Patients with SA consistently demonstrated a higher rate of health care utilization. Funding for this study (HO-14-14443) was provided by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

  "27482315": "Preoperative ultrasonographic findings of internal jugular veins and carotid arteries in kidney transplant recipients Hemodialysis via the internal jugular vein (IJV) has been widely used for patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, as they have a higher risk of arterial diseases. We investigated the ultrasonographic findings of the IJV and carotid artery (CA) in recipients of kidney transplantation (KT) and identified factors influencing IJV / CA abnormalities. We enrolled 120 adult KT recipients. Patients in group A (n = 57) had a history of IJV hemodialysis, while those in group B (n = 63) were not yet on dialysis or undergoing dialysis methods not involving the IJV. The day before surgery, we evaluated the state of the IJV and CA using ultrasonography. We followed patients with IJV stenosis for six months after KT. Ultrasonography revealed that four patients (7%) in group A had IJV abnormalities, while no patients in group B had abnormalities (P = 0.118). Of the four patients with abnormalities, one with 57.4% stenosis normalized during follow- up. However, another patient with 90.1% stenosis progressed to occlusion, while the two patients with total occlusion remained the same. Twenty patients in group A (n = 11) and B (n = 9) had several CA abnormalities (P = 0.462). Upon multivariate analysis with stepwise selection, height and age were significantly correlated with IJV stenosis (P = 0.043, odds ratio = 0.9) and CA abnormality (P = 0.012, odds ratio = 1.1), respectively. IJV abnormalities (especially with a history of IJV hemodialysis) and CA abnormalities may be present in ESRD patients. Therefore, we recommend ultrasonographic evaluation before catheterization.",

Remarkable improvement in mechanical properties of the nanocomposites was noticed after micro-tensile analysis. Enlarged surface area and higher aspect ratio of CaSiO3 nanowires were the key factors responsible for such improvement. This was supported by EDS and XRD analysis in terms of proper distribution of nanofiller through the copolymer matrix and corresponding rise in percentage crystallanity respectively. Contact angle and biodegradation studies further clarified that nano - CaSiO3 did not affect the hydrophilicity and general degradation route of chitosan copolymer respectively. This renders the nano - CaSiO3 as an ideal substitute for preparing high performance nanocomposites to be applicable for biomedical applications.",
  "27588139": "Clinicopathological relevance of kinesin family member 18A expression in invasive breast cancer Recently, kinesin motor proteins have been focused on as targets for cancer therapy. Kinesins are microtubule -based motor proteins that mediate diverse functions within the cell, including the transport of vesicles, organelles, chromosomes and protein complexes, as well as the movement of microtubules. In the current study, the expression of kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A), a member of kinesin superfamily, was investigated in breast cancer using immunohistochemistry, and its effect on breast cancer prognosis was examined. KIF18A expression level was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.047). In patients with high levels of KIF18A expression, survival was significantly poorer compared to patients with low levels of KIF18A expression (disease-free survival, P=0.030). Multivariate analysis revealed that venous invasion (hazard ratio, 9.22; 95% confidence interval, 3.90-23.66; P<0.001) and KIF18A expression (hazard ratio, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-6.09; P=0.010) were independent predictive factors for lymph node metastasis. KIF18A may be a useful predictive marker for lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which could facilitate curative adjuvant treatment.",
  "27754397": "Total Energy Expenditure in Obese Kuwaiti Primary School Children Assessed by the Doubly-Labeled Water Technique The aim of this pilot study was to assess body composition and total energy expenditure (TEE) in 35 obese 7-9 years old Kuwaiti children (18 girls and 17 boys). Total body water (TBW) and TEE were assessed by doubly-labeled water technique. TBW was derived from the intercept of the elimination rate of deuterium and TEE from the difference in elimination rates of (18)O and deuterium. TBW was used to estimate fat-free mass (FFM), using hydration factors for different ages and gender. Fat mass (FM) was calculated as the difference between body weight and FFM. Body weight was not statistically different but TBW was significantly higher (p = 0.018) in boys (44.9% ± 3.3%) than girls (42.4% ± 3.0%), while girls had significantly higher estimated FM (45.2 ± 3.9 weight % versus 41.6% ± 4.3%; p = 0.014). TEE was significantly higher in boys (2395 ± 349 kcal/day) compared with girls (1978 ± 169 kcal/day); p = 0.001. Estimated physical activity level (PAL) was significantly higher in boys; 1.61 ± 0.167 versus 1.51 ± 0.870; p = 0.034. Our results provide the first dataset of TEE in 7-9 years old obese Kuwaiti children and highlight important gender differences to be considered during the development of school based interventions targeted to combat childhood obesity.",
  "28251753": "Optomechanical Control of Quantum Yield in Trans-Cis Ultrafast Photoisomerization of a Retinal Chromophore Model The quantum yield of a photochemical reaction is one of the most fundamental quantities in photochemistry, as it measures the efficiency of the transduction of light energy into chemical energy. Nature has evolved photoreceptors in which the reactivity of a chromophore is enhanced by its molecular environment to achieve high quantum yields. The retinal chromophore sterically constrained inside rhodopsin proteins represents an outstanding example of such a control. In a more general framework, mechanical forces acting on a molecular system can strongly modify its reactivity. Herein, we show that the exertion of tensile forces on a simplified retinal chromophore model provokes a substantial and regular increase in the trans-to-cis photoisomerization quantum yield in a counterintuitive way, as these extension forces facilitate the formation of the more compressed cis photoisomer. A rationale for the mechanochemical effect on this photoisomerization mechanism is also proposed.",
  "27677676": "Early second-trimester plasma levels of NT-proBNP in women who subsequently develop early-onset preeclampsia Plasma levels of NT-proBNP are elevated in women with preeclampsia at the time of diagnosis. The objective of this case-control study was to evaluate N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) in maternal plasma as an early second-trimester biomarker for prediction of early-onset preeclampsia. In early second-trimester samples, women who later developed preeclampsia at gestational age 34 wk + 0 or earlier (n = 16) had similar plasma levels of NT-proBNP (median 51.8, range 26.1-131.9 pg/ml) as women with uncomplicated pregnancy outcomes (n = 43) (53.0, 14.9-184.2 pg/ml). The early second-trimester level of NT-proBNP cannot therefore be used as a predictive biomarker of early-onset preeclampsia.",
  "28125165": "Inhibitor Selectivity for Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 7: A Structural, Thermodynamic, and Modelling Study Deregulation of the cell cycle by mechanisms that lead to elevated activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) is a feature of many human diseases, cancer in particular. We identified small-molecule inhibitors that selectively inhibit CDK7, the kinase that phosphorylates cell-cycle CDKs to promote their activities. To investigate the selectivity of these inhibitors we used a combination of structural, biophysical, and modelling approaches. We determined the crystal structures of the CDK7 -selective compounds ICEC0942 and ICEC0943 bound to CDK2, and used these to build models of inhibitor binding to CDK7. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of inhibitors bound to CDK2 and CDK7 generated possible models of inhibitor binding. To experimentally validate these models, we gathered isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) binding data for recombinant wild-type and binding site mutants of CDK7 and CDK2. We identified specific residues of CDK7, notably Asp155, that are involved in determining inhibitor selectivity. Our MD simulations also show that the flexibility of the G-rich and activation loops of CDK7 is likely an important determinant of inhibitor specificity similar to CDK2.",
  "28534189": "National Trends in Bariatric Surgery 2012-2015: Demographics, Procedure Selection, Readmissions, and Cost Bariatric surgery is widely accepted as the best treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) have become the predominant bariatric procedures in the USA over the last several years, although the most recent trends in selection are unknown. The objective of this study is to assess selection trends, readmission rates, and cost of bariatric procedures in the USA from 2012 to 2015. We used the Premier database from 2012 to 2015 to examine trends in incidence of RYGB, adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), and SG; readmissions; and cost. Multivariate regression was performed to identify predictors of readmission. The proportion of SG went up from 38 to 63% while the RYGB decreased from 44 to 30% over this time period. LAGB has decreased in use from 13 to 2%. In comparison to RYGB, readmission was less likely for SG (OR 0.64), males (OR 0.91), and more likely for black race (OR 1.27). The overall proportion of patients seeking RYGB with type 2 diabetes was higher than with SG (36 versus 25%), but SG has now overtaken RYGB as the most common procedure among diabetics. The SG is less costly than RYGB ($11,183 versus $13,485). There is a continued overall trend in the increased popularity of the SG and decreased utilization of the RYGB and LAGB, although growth of the SG appears to be slowing. This is also true among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Regardless of surgery type, underinsured and African-American race were more likely to be readmitted.",
  "27465939": "microRNA-145 Mediates the Inhibitory Effect of Adipose Tissue -Derived Stromal Cells on Prostate Cancer Adipose-derived stromal cell (ASC), known as one of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), is a promising tool for regenerative medicine; however, the effect of ASCs on tumor growth has not been studied sufficiently. We investigated the hypothesis that ASCs have an inhibitory effect on metastatic tumor progression. To evaluate the in vitro inhibitory effect of ASCs on metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), direct coculture and indirect separate culture experiments with PC3M-luc2 cells and human ASCs were performed, and ASCs were administered to PC3M-luc2 cell -derived tumor -bearing nude mice for in vivo experiment. We also performed exosome microRNA (miRNA) array analysis to explore a mechanistic insight into the effect of ASCs on PCa cell proliferation / apoptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments exhibited the inhibitory effect of ASCs on PC3M-luc2 cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis and PCa growth, respectively. Among upregulated miRNAs in ASCs compared with fibroblasts, we focused on miR-145, which was known as a tumor suppressor. ASC -derived conditioned medium (CM) significantly inhibited PC3M-luc2 cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, but the effect was canceled by miR-145 knockdown in ASCs. ASC miR-145 knockdown CM also reduced the expression of Caspase 3 / 7 with increased antiapoptotic protein, BclxL, expression in PC3M-luc2 cells. This study provides preclinical data that ASCs inhibit PCa growth, inducing PCa cell apoptosis with reduced activity of BclxL, at least in part, by miR-145, including exosomes released from ASCs, suggesting that ASC administration could be a novel and promising therapeutic strategy in patients with PCa.",
  "27334669": "Self-assembled polymeric vectors mixtures: characterization of the polymorphism and existence of synergistic effects in photodynamic therapy The objective of this work was to assess the relation between the purity of polymeric self-assemblies vectors solution and their photodynamic therapeutic efficiency. For this, several amphiphilic block copolymers of poly(ethyleneoxide-b-ε-caprolactone) have been used to form self-assemblies with different morphologies (micelles, worm-like micelles or vesicles). In a first step, controlled mixtures of preformed micelles and vesicles have been characterized both by dynamic light scattering and asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation (AsFlFFF). For this, a custom-made program, STORMS, was developed to analyze DLS data in a thorough manner by providing a large set of fitting parameters. This showed that DLS only sensed the larger vesicles when the micelles / vesicles ratio was 80/20 w/w. On the other hand, AsFlFFF allowed clear detection of the presence of micelles when this same ratio was as low as 10/90. Subsequently, the photodynamic therapy efficiency of various controlled mixtures was assessed using multicellular spheroids when a photosensitizer, pheophorbide a, was encapsulated in the polymer self-assemblies. Some mixtures were shown to be as efficient as monomorphous systems. In some cases, mixtures were found to exhibit a higher PDT efficiency compared to the individual nano - objects, revealing a synergistic effect for the efficient delivery of the photosensitizer. Polymorphous vectors can therefore be superior in therapeutic applications.",

Validation of such methods is an obstacle in the adoption of new bio-sensing technologies for water testing. Therefore, establishing a quality assurance and quality control (QA / QC) plan is essential to demonstrate accuracy and reliability of the biosensor method for the detection of E. coli in drinking water samples. In this study, different reagents and assay conditions including temperatures, holding time, E. coli strains and concentrations, dissolving agents, salinity and pH effects, quality of substrates of various suppliers of 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (MUG), and environmental water samples were included in the QA / QC plan and used in the assay optimization and documentation. Furthermore, the procedural QA / QC for the monitoring of drinking water samples was established to validate the performance of the biosensor platform for the detection of E. coli using a culture -based standard technique. Implementing the developed QA / QC plan, the same level of precision and accuracy was achieved using both the standard and the biosensor methods. The established procedural QA / QC for the biosensor will provide a reliable tool for a near real-time monitoring of E. coli in drinking water samples to both industry and regulatory authorities.",

Here, a case of severe sprue-like enteropathy and acute kidney injury is described in a 68-year-old male taking olmesartan for 3-4 years. He presented to hospital with a five-week history of diarrhea, vomiting, and a 20 lb weight loss. Anti-TTG was negative with a normal IgA. Biopsies of the distal duodenum and duodenal cap revealed marked blunting of the villi with near complete villous atrophy of the biopsies from the bulb. There was an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes as well as neutrophils in the surface epithelium. The patient's diarrhea improved upon discontinuation of olmesartan and he returned to his previous weight. Repeat endoscopy four months later demonstrated complete resolution of inflammatory change with normal villous architecture. Long-term olmesartan use is associated with severe sprue-like enteropathy. The mechanism of intestinal injury is unknown. Duodenal biopsy results may mimic other enteropathies such as celiac disease. Physicians should consider medications as potential etiologies of enteropathy.",

Biosafety Level 4 Suit Laboratory Suite Entry and Exit Procedures Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) suit laboratories are specifically designed to study high-consequence pathogens for which neither infection prophylaxes nor treatment options exist. The hallmarks of these laboratories are: custom-designed airtight doors, dedicated supply and exhaust airflow systems, a negative-pressure environment, and mandatory use of positive-pressure (\"space\") suits. The risk for laboratory specialists working with highly pathogenic agents is minimized through rigorous training and adherence to stringent safety protocols and standard operating procedures. Researchers perform the majority of their work in BSL-2 laboratories and switch to BSL-4 suit laboratories when work with a high-consequence pathogen is required. Collaborators and scientists considering BSL-4 projects should be aware of the challenges associated with BSL-4 research both in terms of experimental technical limitations in BSL-4 laboratory space and the increased duration of such experiments. Tasks such as entering and exiting the BSL-4 suit laboratories are considerably more complex and time-consuming compared to BSL-2 and BSL-3 laboratories. The focus of this particular article is to address basic biosafety concerns and describe the entrance and exit procedures for the BSL-4 laboratory at the NIH / NIAID Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick. Such procedures include checking external systems that support the BSL-4 laboratory, and inspecting and donning positive-pressure suits, entering the laboratory, moving through air pressure - resistant doors, and connecting to air-supply hoses. We will also discuss moving within and exiting the BSL-4 suit laboratories, including using the chemical shower and removing and storing positive-pressure suits.",

Knowledge of LS accessory attachments is relevant to clinicians working in the fields of radiology, surgery, neurology, and musculoskeletal medicine. The purpose of this study was to explore the incidence and spectrum of LS caudal accessory attachments in vivo using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in a young cohort. MR images of the cervical spine were obtained from 37 subjects (13 males and 24 females) aged 18-36 years using an axial T1-weighted spin echo sequence acquired from a 3-Tesla MR scanner. The LS muscle was identified, and the presence of caudal accessory attachments was recorded and described. LS caudal accessory attachments were identified in 16 subjects (4 right, 6 left, and 6 bilateral; 12 female). Ten had unilateral accessory attachments to the serratus anterior, serratus posterior superior or the first/second rib. Four had bilateral accessory attachments to serratus anterior. One had bilateral accessory attachments to serratus posterior superior and unilateral accessory attachment to serratus anterior. One had bilateral attachments to both muscles. Both unilateral and bilateral LS caudal accessory attachments were present in nearly half of the subjects examined. They were relatively more frequent in females than males. The findings indicate that these accessory attachments are common, and in some cases, those accessory attachments can occur bilaterally and to more than one site.",
  "27998493": "Periodontal status of tuberculosis patients - Is there a two-way link? The influence of systemic disorders on periodontal tissues is well established. Amongst various chronic debilitating diseases, tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major health problems in most developing countries. Although it has a definite affinity for the lungs, it can affect any part of the body including the oral cavity. TB and periodontitis are the two distinct disease processes. But environmental and biological factors play a key role in etiopathogenesis of both the diseases. These factors alter tissue microenvironment leading to cascade of untoward events. To assess and compare the periodontal status of TB patients with that of non-TB subjects. 50 subjects were recruited and divided into 2 groups. Group A consisted of subjects suffering from TB serving as Test group while group B included non-TB subjects serving as Control group. Unpaired t-test was used. Statistically significant difference in probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing was found between groups A and B, with the difference being higher in group A subjects, thus concluding that periodontal status might be linked with TB.",

All CTA-TA exams at the study institution performed between 1/1/2013 and 8/14/2015 were reviewed retrospectively to identify those exams which had been performed using ION-IVA (ION-exams). ION-exams were then analyzed to determine aortic attenuation and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Linear regression was used to determine how injection rate and other variables affected image quality for ION-exams. Patient electronic medical records were reviewed to identify any adverse events related to CTA-TA or ION-IVA. 17 (∼0.2%) of 7401 exams were ION-exams. ION-exam CMI rates varied between 2.5 and 4 ml/s. Mean attenuation was 312 HU (SD 88 HU) and mean CNR was 25 (SD 9.9). A strong positive linear association between attenuation and injection rate was found. No immediate or delayed complications related to the ION-exams, or intraosseous needle use in general, occurred. For CTA-TA, ION-IVA appears to be a safe and effective route for CMI at rates up to 4 ml/s.",
  "27722881": "Fluoranthene degradation and binding mechanism study based on the active-site structure of ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase in Microbacterium paraoxydans JPM1 In this study, a gram-positive fluoranthene-degrading bacterial strain was isolated from crude oil in Dagang Oilfield and identified as Microbacterium paraoxydans JPM1 by the analysis of 16S rDNA sequence. After 25 days of incubation, the strain JPM1 could degrade 91.78 % of the initial amount of fluoranthene. Moreover, four metabolites 9-fluorenone-1-carboxylic acid, 9-fluorenone, phthalic acid, and benzoic acid were detected in the culture solution. The gene sequence encoding the aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase was amplified in the strain JPM1 by PCR. Based on the translated protein sequence, a homology modeling method was applied to build the crystal structure of dioxygenase. Subsequently, the interaction mechanism between fluoranthene and the active site of dioxygenase was simulated and analyzed by molecular docking. Consequently, a feasible degrading pathway of fluoranthene in the strain JPM1 was proposed based on the metabolites and the interaction analyses. Additionally, the thermodynamic analysis showed that the strain JPM1 had high tolerance for fluoranthene, and the influence of fluoranthene for the bacterial growth activity was negligible under 100 to 400 mg L(-1) concentrations. Taken together, this study indicates that the strain JPM1 has high potential for further study in bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)- contaminated sites.",

First, the nutrients were recovered from wheat bran by acid protease hydrolysis. Then, cellulosic hydrolysates were prepared from protease -treated samples after acid pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification. The combined use of nutrients and hydrolysates as nitrogen and carbon sources for fermentation by S. inulinus YB1-5 resulted in d-Lactate levels of 99.5g/L, with an average production efficiency of 1.94g/L/h and a yield of 0.89g/g glucose. Moreover, fed-batch simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process at 40°C, 20% (w/v) solid loading and 20FPU/g solid cellulase concentration was obtained. d-Lactate concentrations, yield, productivity, and optical purity were 87.3g/L, 0.65g/g glucose, 0.81g/L/h and 99.1%, respectively. This study provided a feasible procedure that can help produce cellulosic d-Lactate using agricultural waste without external nutrient supplementation.",
  "27651148": "Striatal dopamine modulates timing of self-initiated saccades The ability to adjust movement timing is essential in daily life. Explorations of the underlying neural mechanisms have reported a gradual increase or decrease in neuronal activity prior to self-timed movements within the cortico - basal ganglia loop. Previous studies in both humans and animals have shown that endogenous dopamine (DA) plays a modulatory role in self-timing. However, the specific site of dopaminergic regulation remains elusive because the systemic application of DA - related substances can directly alter both cortical and subcortical neuronal activities. To investigate the role of striatal DA in self-timing, we locally injected DA receptor agonists or antagonists into the striatum of two female monkeys (Macaca fuscata) while they performed two versions of the memory-guided saccade (MS) task. In the conventional, triggered MS task, animals made a saccade to the location of a previously flashed visual cue in response to the fixation point offset. In the self-timed MS task, monkeys were rewarded for making a self-initiated saccade within a predetermined time interval following the cue. Infusion of a small amount of a D1 or D2 antagonist led to early saccades in the self-timed, but not the triggered MS tasks, while infusion of DA agonists produced no consistent effect. We also found that local administration of nicotinic but not muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists and antagonists altered the timing of self-initiated saccades. Our data suggest that the timing of self-initiated movements may be regulated by the balance of signals in the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways, as well as that between both hemispheres of the brain.",

  "28370728": "Towards culturally competent paediatric oncology care. A qualitative study from the perspective of care providers In order to gain more insight on the influence of ethnic diversity in paediatric cancer care, the perspectives of care providers were explored. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 12 paediatric oncologists and 13 nurses of two different paediatric oncology wards and were analysed using a framework method. We found that care providers described the contact with Turkish and Moroccan parents as more difficult. They offered two reasons for this: (1) language barriers between care provider and parents hindered the exchange of information; (2) cultural barriers between care provider and parents about sharing the diagnosis and palliative perspective hindered communication. Care providers reported different solutions to deal with these barriers, such as using an interpreter and improving their cultural knowledge about their patients. They, however, were not using interpreters sufficiently and were unaware of the importance of eliciting parents ' perspectives. Communication techniques to overcome dilemmas between parents and care providers were not used and care providers were unaware of stereotypes and prejudice. Care providers should be offered insight in cultural barriers they are unaware of. Training in cultural competence might be a possibility to overcome manifest barriers.",

We hypothesized that revision of MOMA for painful micromotion of the cup, in the absence of ALTR, would have a more favorable outcome. We reviewed our database for Durom acetabular shell revision with minimum 24 months (24 months to 8 years) follow-up. Patients with a diagnosis of painful micromotion in the absence of pseudotumor was identified. At mid-term follow-up, 71 patients had undergone revision of a Durom MOMA. Twenty-seven of these (38%) were for painful micromotion (9 total hip arthroplasty, 18 hip resurfacing) of the cup alone. Following revision surgery, all patients reported resolution of the preoperative pain, as well as satisfactory outcome measures (mean scores: The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index [WOMAC] 84.6, oxford hip score 84.7, Short Form Health Survey (SF-16) 51, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) 7.3). Radiologically, all cases demonstrated osseointegration of the revision shells; 1 case had zone-3 radiolucency that was nonprogressive. One patient had a dislocation treated by closed reduction at 10 weeks. Revision MOMA for painful micromotion of the shell in the absence of ALTR is not similar to revision for ALTR and is associated with predictable improvement in pain and quality of life.",

Herein, we evaluated whether 1-hour post-load plasma glucose ≥155 mg/dl combined with HbA1c may identify pre-diabetic individuals with a higher cardio-metabolic risk. Anthropometric and metabolic characteristics, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion assessed by OGTT -derived indexes, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), pulse pressure, and rate pressure product were evaluated in 1495 individuals. As compared with subjects with 1-hour post-load glucose <155 mg/dl, individuals with 1-hour post-load glucose ≥155 mg/dl exhibited a significantly worse cardio metabolic profile, both in the group with HbA1c <5.7%, and in the group with prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7-6.4%). Specifically, in both groups, subjects with 1-hour post-load glucose ≥155 mg/dl had higher fasting and 2-h post-load glucose (p < 0.0001 for all in both group s), higher HOMA-IR (p < 0.0001 in both groups), and carotid IMT (p = 0.05 in the group with HbA1c <5.7% and p = 0.03 in the group HbA1c 5.7-6.4%), as well as lower Matsuda index, insulinogenic index and disposition index (p < 0.0001 in both groups), and lower insulin - stimulated glucose disposal (p < 0.0001 in the group with HbA1c <5.7% and p = 0.03 in the group HbA1c 5.7-6.4%).

  "27457997": "Identification of a peroxisomal -targeted aldolase involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and sugar metabolism in rice Chlorophyll plays remarkable and critical roles in photosynthetic light-harvesting, energy transduction and plant development. In this study, we identified a rice Chl -deficient mutant, ygdl-1 (yellow green and droopy leaf-1), which showed yellow-green leaves throughout plant development with decreased content of Chls and carotene and an increased Chl a/b ratio. The ygdl-1 mutant also exhibited severe defects in chloroplast development, including disorganized grana stacks. Sequence analysis revealed that the mutant contained a T-DNA insertion within the promoter of a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (OsAld-Y), which dramatically reduced the OsAld-Y mRNA level, and its identity was verified by transgenic complementation. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast development were concurrently altered in the ygdl-1 mutant. The expression of OsAld-Y - GFP fusion protein in tobacco epidermal cells showed that OsAld-Y was localized to the peroxisome. In addition, the analysis of primary carbon metabolites revealed the significantly reduced levels of sucrose and fructose in the mutant leaves, while the glucose content was similar to wild-type plants. Our results suggest that the OsAld-Y participates in Chl accumulation, chloroplast development and plant growth by influencing the photosynthetic rate of leaves and the sugar metabolism of rice.",

The distribution of apelinergic fibers and receptors in the hypothalamus may suggest a role of apelin-13 on energy balance regulation, albeit the studies reporting the acute effects of apelin on feeding control are inconsistent. Considering the possible involvement of apelinergic system on hypothalamic appetite controlling network, in the present study we evaluated in the rat the effects of intrahypothalamic apelin-13 injection on food intake and the involvement of orexigenic and anorexigenic hypothalamic peptides and neurotransmitters. Eighteen rats (6 for each group of treatment) were injected into the ARC with either vehicle or apelin-13 (1-2 μg/ rat). Food intake and hypothalamic peptide and neurotransmitter levels were evaluated 2 and 24 h after injection. Compared to vehicle, apelin-13 administration increased food intake both 2 and 24 h following treatment. This effect could be related to inhibited cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) gene expression and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) synthesis and release, and increased orexin A gene expression in the hypothalamus.",

The microbial electrochemical degradation is achieved in a membraneless flow -through bioanode - biocathode setup operating at an applied voltage below the water electrolysis threshold. Laboratory wastewater treatment tests conducted through a broad range of mesophilic and psychrophilic temperatures (5-23 °C) using synthetic wastewater showed a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) removal efficiency of 90-97% and an effluent BOD5 concentration as low as 7 mg L(-1). An electricity consumption of 0.6 kWh kg(-1) of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removed was observed. Low energy consumption coupled with enhanced methane production led to a net positive energy balance in the bioelectrochemical treatment system.",

The Cardiff pain chart records the severity of pain in the form of a triangle for mild to moderate pain and a square for severe pain. Moreover, Cardiff pain chart does not allow a patient to record the severity of pain on days of menses, as she has to put the letter \"P\" in the box. These problems have been resolved in the new breast pain chart. In the new pain chart, the lady records pain severity in the form of visual linear analogue scale score on every day of menstrual cycle. She enters her menstrual experience on a separate part of chart, which allows us to visualize the full month's pain severity in an uncluttered way.",
  "28053186": "AAV9 - NPC1 significantly ameliorates Purkinje cell death and behavioral abnormalities in mouse NPC disease Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. There is no effective way to treat NPC disease. In this study, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9 (AAV9) to deliver a functional NPC1 gene systemically into NPC1(-/-) mice at postnatal day 4. One single AAV9-NPC1 injection resulted in robust NPC1 expression in various tissues, including brain, heart, and lung. Strikingly, AAV9-mediated NPC1 delivery significantly promoted Purkinje cell survival, restored locomotor activity and coordination, and increased the lifespan of NPC1(-/-) mice. Our work suggests that AAV-based gene therapy is a promising means to treat NPC disease.",
  "27575455": "Maf1 -mediated regulation of yeast RNA polymerase III is correlated with CCA addition at the 3' end of tRNA precursors In eukaryotic cells tRNA synthesis is negatively regulated by the protein Maf1, conserved from yeast to humans. Maf1 from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediates repression of trna transcription when cells are transferred from medium with glucose to medium with glycerol, a non-fermentable carbon source. The strain with deleted gene encoding Maf1 (maf1Δ) is viable but accumulates tRNA precursors. In this study tRNA precursors were analysed by RNA-Seq and Northern hybridization in wild type strain and maf1Δ mutant grown in glucose medium or upon shift to repressive conditions. A negative effect of maf1Δ mutant on the addition of the auxiliary CCA nucleotides to the 3' end of pre-tRNAs was observed in cells shifted to unfavourable growth conditions. This effect was reduced by overexpression of the yeast CCA1 gene encoding ATP(CTP):tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. The CCA sequence at the 3' end is important for export of tRNA precursors from the nucleus and essential for tRNA charging with amino acids. Data presented here indicate that CCA-addition to intron -containing end-processed tRNA precursors is a limiting step in tRNA maturation when there is no Maf1 mediated RNA polymerase III (Pol III) repression. The correlation between CCA synthesis and Pol III regulation by Maf1 could be important in coordination of tRNA transcription, processing and regulation of translation.",

Therefore the aim of the present study was to evaluate the tooth discoloration potential of a nano zinc oxide-eugenol (NZOE) sealer. In order to evaluate tooth discoloration, the pulp chamber of 60 human maxillary central and lateral incisors were filled with one of the sealers, naming AH-26 (resin-based sealer), Pulpdent sealer (ZOE -based) and a NZOE experimental sealer. Color measurements was assessed at the baseline (before placement of sealers) (T0), 24 h (T1) and 72 h (T2) h, 1- week (T3), and 1- month (T4) after the placement of sealers using the Easy Shade spectrophotometer. Data were analyzed in SPSS software using one-way ANOVA, and repeated measured ANOVA. No significant differences were observed when the paired comparison test was performed (P>0.05). The tested NZOE sealer had similar tooth discoloration potential in comparison with AH-26 and ZOE sealer.",

Thirty-six children with IN were included. Eighteen had idiopathic IN and 18 had oculocutaneous albinism. These children were divided in two training groups matched on age and diagnosis: a crowded training group (n = 18) and an uncrowded training group (n = 18). Training occurred two times per week during 5 weeks (3500 trials per training). Eleven age - matched children with normal vision were included to assess baseline differences in task performance and test-retest learning. Main outcome measures were task - specific performance, distance and near visual acuity (DVA and NVA), intensity and extent of (foveal) crowding at 5 m and 40 cm, and stereopsis. Training resulted in task - specific improvements. Both training groups also showed uncrowded and crowded DVA improvements (0.10 ± 0.02 and 0.11 ± 0.02 logMAR) and improved stereopsis (670 ± 249″). Crowded NVA improved only in the crowded training group (0.15 ± 0.02 logMAR), which was also the only group showing a reduction in near crowding intensity (0.08 ± 0.03 logMAR). Effects were not due to test-retest learning. Perceptual learning with or without distractors reduces the extent of crowding and improves visual acuity in children with IN. Training with distractors improves near vision more than training with single optotypes. Perceptual learning also transfers to DVA and NVA under uncrowded and crowded conditions and even stereopsis. Learning curves indicated that improvements may be larger after longer training.",
  "28235687": "Immodin and its immune system supportive role in paclitaxel therapy of 4T1 mouse breast cancer It is evident that standard chemotherapy agents may have an impact on both tumor and host immune system. Paclitaxel (PTX), a very potent anticancer drug from a taxane family, has achieved prominence in clinical oncology for its efficacy against a wide range of tumors including breast cancer. However, significant toxicity, such as myelosuppression, limit the effectiveness of Paclitaxel -based treatment regimens. Immodin (IM) is low molecular dialysate fraction of homogenate made from human leukocytes. It contains a mixture of substances from which so far have been described e.g. Imreg 1 and Imreg 2 formed by the dipeptide tyrosine-glycine and the tripeptide tyrosine-glycine-glycine, respectively. The aim of this study was to explore immunopharmacological activities of IM, using the strongly immunogenic 4T1 mouse breast cancer model, and evaluate its effect on the reactivity and the efficiency of PTX cancer therapy. The results highlight a potentially beneficial role for IM in alleviating PTX - induced toxicity, especially on the nonspecific immunity, during breast cancer therapy. Co-treatment exhibited an antitumor effect including reduced tumor growth, prolonged survival of tumor bearing mice, increased number of monocytes and lymphocytes in peripheral blood. In spleens, IM + PTX therapy elevated proportion of whole lymphocytes in the account of myelo-monocytic cells characteristic with low expression of CD11c+ and bearing Fc receptor (CD16 / 32) as well as T-lymphocytes, NK cells and dendritic cells. Accumulation of tumor - associated granulocytes in stroma of PTX - treated group and intensive 4T1 - necrosis / apoptosis in tumors after co-treatment were also recorded. These findings suggest the possibility of using IM alongside PTX treatment for maintaining the immune system functions and increasing patient survival.",

Its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Although extensively described in children, it is still incompletely studied in adults. Our objective was to present five adult cases with emphasis on imaging findings and long-term evolution. From 2006 to 2014, we included 5 HIV - infected patients presenting with fusiform cerebral aneurysms. Vessels abnormalities were assessed with brain computed tomography (CT) angiography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). All patients had MR assessment of the brain. Clinical and biological data were analyzed. Fusiform aneurysms of carotid terminations extending to middle and anterior cerebral arteries were bilateral in three patients and unilateral in one. More distal fusiform aneurysms were observed in four patients and saccular aneurysms in two patients, two patients suffered from ischemic lesions while none experienced hemorrhage. Unlike recent reviews, our study underlines the low hemorrhagic potential of HIV - AECV and long-term follow-up suggests a monophasic evolution under antiretroviral medication.",
  "28005982": "Depot Dependent Effects of Dexamethasone on Gene Expression in Human Omental and Abdominal Subcutaneous Adipose Tissues from Obese Women Glucocorticoids promote fat accumulation in visceral compared to subcutaneous depots, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. To identify long-term changes in gene expression that are differentially sensitive or responsive to glucocorticoids in these depots, paired samples of human omental (Om) and abdominal subcutaneous (Abdsc) adipose tissues obtained from obese women during elective surgery were cultured with the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (Dex, 0, 1, 10, 25 and 1000 nM) for 7 days. Dex regulated 32% of the 19,741 genes on the array, while 53% differed by Depot and 2.5% exhibited a Depot * Dex concentration interaction. Gene set enrichment analysis showed Dex regulation of the expected metabolic and inflammatory pathways in both depots. Cluster analysis of the 460 transcripts that exhibited an interaction of Depot and Dex concentration revealed sets of mRNAs for which the responses to Dex differed in magnitude, sensitivity or direction between the two depots as well as mRNAs that responded to Dex only in one depot. These transcripts were also clearly depot different in fresh adipose tissue and are implicated in processes that could affect adipose tissue distribution or functions (e.g. adipogenesis, triacylglycerol synthesis and storage, insulin action). Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the depot differences in the effect of Dex on the expression of specific genes and pathways that regulate adipose function may offer novel insights into understanding the biology of visceral adipose tissues and their links to metabolic health.",

  "28370605": "Metabolite mapping by consecutive nanostructure and silver-assisted mass spectrometry imaging on tissue sections Nanostructure-based mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a promising technology for molecular imaging of small molecules, without the complex chemical background typically encountered in matrix-assisted molecular imaging approaches. Here, we have enhanced these surfaces with silver (Ag) to provide a second tier of MSI data from a single sample. MSI data was acquired through the application of laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to biological samples imprinted onto desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS) substrates. Following initial analysis, ultra-thin Ag layers were overlaid onto the followed by MSI analysis (Ag-DIOS MSI). This approach was first demonstrated for fingermark small molecules including environmental contaminants and sebum components. Subsequently, this bimodal method was translated to lipids and metabolites in fore-stomach sections from a 6-bromoisatin chemopreventative murine mouse model. DIOS MSI allowed mapping of common ions in fingermarks as well as 6-bromoisatin metabolites and lipids in murine fore-stomach. Furthermore, DIOS MSI was complemented by the Ag-DIOS MSI of Ag-adductable lipids such as wax esters in fingermarks and cholesterol in murine fore-stomach. Gastrointestinal acid condensation products of 6-bromoisatin, such as the 6,6'-dibromoindirubin mapped herein, are very challenging to isolate and characterize. By re-analyzing the same tissue imprints, this metabolite was readily detected by DIOS, placed in a tissue-specific spatial context, and subsequently overlaid with additional lipid distributions acquired using Ag-DIOS MSI. The ability to place metabolite and lipid classes in a tissue-specific context makes this novel method suited to MSI analyses where the collection of additional information from the same sample maximises resource use, and also maximises the number of annotated small molecules, in particular for metabolites that are typically undetectable with traditional platforms.

  "27793507": "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen prevents trinucleotide repeat expansions by promoting repeat deletion and hairpin removal DNA base lesions and base excision repair (BER) within trinucleotide repeat (TNR) tracts modulate repeat instability through the coordination among the key BER enzymes DNA polymerase β, flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) and DNA ligase I (LIG I). However, it remains unknown whether BER cofactors can also alter TNR stability. In this study, we discovered that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cofactor of BER, promoted CAG repeat deletion and removal of a CAG repeat hairpin during BER in a duplex CAG repeat tract and CAG hairpin loop, respectively. We showed that PCNA stimulated LIG I activity on a nick across a small template loop during BER in a duplex (CAG)20 repeat tract promoting small repeat deletions. Surprisingly, we found that during BER in a hairpin loop, PCNA promoted reannealing of the upstream flap of a double-flap intermediate, thereby facilitating the formation of a downstream flap and stimulating FEN1 cleavage activity and hairpin removal. Our results indicate that PCNA plays a critical role in preventing CAG repeat expansions by modulating the structures of dynamic DNA via cooperation with BER enzymes. We provide the first evidence that PCNA prevents CAG repeat expansions during BER by promoting CAG repeat deletion and removal of a TNR hairpin.",
  "28306707": "Severity of illness index for surgical departments in a Cuban hospital: a revalidation study In the context of the evaluation of hospital services, the incorporation of severity indices allows an essential control variable for performance comparisons in time and space through risk adjustment. The severity index for surgical services was developed in 1999 and validated as a general index for surgical services. Sixteen years later the hospital context is different in many ways and a revalidation was considered necessary to guarantee its current usefulness. To evaluate the validity and reliability of the surgical services severity index to warrant its reasonable use under current conditions. A descriptive study was carried out in the General Surgery service of the \" Hermanos Ameijeiras \" Clinical Surgical Hospital of Havana, Cuba during the second half of 2010. We reviewed the medical records of 511 patients discharged from this service. Items were the same as the original index as were their weighted values. Conceptual or construct validity, criterion validity and inter-rater reliability as well as internal consistency of the proposed index were evaluated. Construct validity was expressed as a significant association between the value of the severity index for surgical services and discharge status. A significant association was also found, although weak, with length of hospital stay. Criterion validity was demonstrated through the correlation s between the severity index for surgical services and other similar indices. Regarding criterion validity, the Horn index showed a correlation of 0.722 (95% CI: 0.677-0.761) with our index. With the POSSUM score, correlation was 0.454 (95% CI: 0.388-0.514) with mortality risk and 0.539 (95% CI: 0.462-0.607) with morbidity risk. Internal consistency yielded a standardized Cronbach's alpha of 0.8; inter-rater reliability resulted in a reliability coefficient of 0.98 for the quantitative index and a weighted global Kappa coefficient of 0.87 for the ordinal surgical index of seve rity for surgical services (IGQ). The validity and reliability of the proposed index was satisfactory in all aspects evaluated.

  "27298741": "Cortical Reorganization following Injury Early in Life The brain has a remarkable capacity for reorganization following injury, especially during the first years of life. Knowledge of structural reorganization and its consequences following perinatal injury is sparse. Here we studied changes in brain tissue volume, morphology, perfusion, and integrity in children with hemiplegia compared to typically developing children, using MRI. Children with hemiplegia demonstrated reduced total cerebral volume, with increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and reduced total white matter volumes, with no differences in total gray matter volume, compared to typically developing children. An increase in cortical thickness at the hemisphere contralateral to the lesion (CLH) was detected in motor and language areas, which may reflect compensation for the gray matter loss in the lesion area or retention of ipsilateral pathways. In addition, reduced cortical thickness, perfusion, and surface area were detected in limbic areas. Increased CSF volume and precentral cortical thickness and reduced white matter volume were correlated with worse motor performance. Brain reorganization of the gray matter within the CLH, while not necessarily indicating better outcome, is suggested as a response to neuronal deficits following injury early in life.",
  "27242395": "An Efficient and Reliable Statistical Method for Estimating Functional Connectivity in Large Scale Brain Networks Using Partial Correlation Currently, network-oriented analysis of fMRI data has become an important tool for understanding brain organization and brain networks. Among the range of network modeling methods, partial correlation has shown great promises in accurately detecting true brain network connections. However, the application of partial correlation in investigating brain connectivity, especially in large-scale brain networks, has been limited so far due to the technical challenges in its estimation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable statistical method for estimating partial correlation in large-scale brain network modeling. Our method derives partial correlation based on the precision matrix estimated via Constrained L1-minimization Approach (CLIME), which is a recently developed statistical method that is more efficient and demonstrates better performance than the existing methods. To help select an appropriate tuning parameter for sparsity control in the network estimation, we propose a new Dens-based selection method that provides a more informative and flexible tool to allow the users to select the tuning parameter based on the desired sparsity level. Another appealing feature of the Dens-based method is that it is much faster than the existing methods, which provides an important advantage in neuroimaging applications. Simulation studies show that the Dens-based method demonstrates comparable or better performance with respect to the existing methods in network estimation. We applied the proposed partial correlation method to investigate resting state functional connectivity using rs-fMRI data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) study. Our results show that partial correlation analysis removed considerable between-module marginal connections identified by full correlation analysis, suggesting these connections were likely caused by global effects or common connection to other nodes. Based on partial correlation, we find that the most significant direct connections are between homologous brain locations in the left and right hemisphere. When comparing partial correlation derived under different sparse tuning parameters, an important finding is that the sparse regularization has more shrinkage effects on negative functional connections than on positive connections, which supports previous findings that many of the negative brain connections are due to non-neurophysiological effects. An R package \"DensParcorr\" can be downloaded from CRAN for implementing the proposed statistical methods.",
  "28295933": "High concordance of findings obtained from transgluteal magnetic resonance imaging - and transrectal ultrasonography - guided biopsy as compared with prostatectomy specimens To determine the utility of our transgluteal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)- guided prostate biopsy approach. A total of 960 biopsy series, taken within the period of 1 year, were evaluated, including 301 MRI-guided and 659 transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)- guided biopsies. The positivity rate and proportion of high grade cancers were significantly higher in MRI-guided than in TRUS - guided biopsies. Of 301 MRI-guided biopsies, 65.4% contained cancer while 57.2% of 659 TRUS biopsies contained cancer (P = 0.016). Gleason grade 3 + 3 = 6 disease was observed in 16.8% of 197 MRI-guided and in 36.1% of 377 TRUS - guided biopsies (P < 0.001). There was also a markedly higher quantity of cancer tissue in MRI-guided biopsies. In all cancers, the mean cancer surface area was 64.8 ± 51.6 mm(2) in MRI-guided biopsies as compared with 23.0 ± 31.4 mm(2) in non-MRI-guided biopsies (P < 0.001). With respect to the tissue quantity, superiority of MRI-guided biopsy was highest in Gleason grade 3 + 3 = 6 cancers (20.9 ± 27.9 vs 5.1 ± 10.2 mm(2); P < 0.001) and in Gleason grade 3 + 4 = 7 cancers (59.7 ± 38.0 vs 17.7 ± 18.4 mm(2); P < 0.001). Comparison of biopsy Gleason grades with findings in prostatectomy specimens was possible in 80 patients with MRI-guided and in 170 patients with non-MRI-guided biopsies. This comparison showed a very high but almost identical concordance of TRUS - and MRI-guided biopsies with the prostatectomy specimen findings. With both approaches, undetected high-risk cancers were present in ~10% of patients with low-risk biopsy results. A significant difference was observed, however, in the proportion of patients who had clinically insignificant cancers and who underwent surgery. The proportion of patients with Gleason grade 3 + 3 = 6 carcinoma in their prostatectomy specimen was 11.2% in the post - TRUS biopsy cohort, but only 2.5% in the post - MRI biopsy cohort (P = 0.021). MRI-guided transgluteal prostate biopsy has a high detection rate for high-risk carcinomas, while the risk of detecting clinically insignificant carcinomas appears to be reduced. This may by itself lead to a reduction of unnecessary prostatectomies. Overtreatment may be further avoided by better applicability of molecular testing to MRI-guided biopsies because of the excessive amount of tissue available for analysis, especially in patients with potential low-risk carcinomas.",

However, the functional role of TIPE2 in prostate cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we explored the role of TIPE2 in prostate cancer and cancer progression including the molecular mechanism that drives TIPE2 -mediated oncogenesis. Our results showed that TIPE2 was lowly expressed in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. In addition, restored TIPE2 obviously inhibits proliferation in prostate cancer cells. TIPE2 overexpression also suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and migration / invasion in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, TIPE2 overexpression obviously inhibits the phosphorylation levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt in prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, for the first time we demonstrated that TIPE2 overexpression may suppress proliferation, migration, and invasion in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, TIPE2 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for human prostate cancer.",

This prospective single-center nonrandomized controlled clinical trial included 100 adult patients undergoing surgery for Stanford type A AAD at an academic hospital in China. Fifty subjects underwent pulmonary static inflation with 50% oxygen from January 2013 to January 2014, and 50 underwent inflation with 50% xenon from January 2014 to December 2014. During CPB, the lungs were inflated with either 50% xenon (xenon group) or 50% oxygen (control group) to maintain an airway pressure of 5 cm H2O. The primary outcome was oxygenation index (OI) value after intubation, and 10 minutes and 6 hours after the operation. The second outcome was cytokine and reactive oxygen species levels after intubation and 10 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after the operation. Patients treated with xenon had lower OI levels compared to the control group before surgery (P = 0.002); however, there was no difference in postoperative values between the 2 groups. Following surgery, mean maximal OI values decreased by 18.8% and 33.8%, respectively, in the xenon and control groups. After surgery, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and thromboxane B2 decreased by 23.5%, 9.1%, and 30.2%, respectively, in the xenon group, but increased by 10.8%, 26.2%, and 26.4%, respectively, in the control group. Moreover, IL-10 levels increased by 28% in the xenon group and decreased by 7.5% in the control group. There were significant time and treatment - time interaction effects on methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (P = 0.000 and P = 0.050, respectively) and myeloperoxidase (P = 0.000 and P = 0.001 in xenon and control groups, respectively). There was no difference in hospital mortality and 1-year survival rate between the 2 groups. Pulmonary static inflation with 50% xenon during CPB could attenuate OI decreases at the end of surgery for Stanford type A AAD. Thus, xenon may function by triggering anti-inflammatory responses and suppressing pro-inflammatory and oxidative effects.",
  "27754781": "Quantification of leakage of sub-micron aerosols through surgical masks and facemasks for pediatric use Surgical respirators, surgical masks (SMs), and facemasks for pediatric use (FPUs) are routinely used in the U.S. healthcare industry as personal protective equipment (PPE) against infectious diseases. While N95s including surgical respirators have been routinely studied, SMs and FPUs have not received as much attention, particularly in the context of aerosolized threats. This is because SMs and PFUs are not designed to protect against sub-micron aerosols. However, with the possibility of new or re-emerging airborne diseases or bio-aerosol weapons lingering, combined with the limited availability of respirators and logistical issues associated with fit-testing millions, the general adult and pediatric populations may elect to wear SMs and FPUs, respectively, in the case of a pandemic or a bio-terrorist attack. When a person dons a PPE, gaps are created between the wearer's face and the PPE, and aerosols leaking through these gaps can be an important contributor to the risk of infection compared to filtered aerosols. To understand and quantify the contribution of leakage of aerosols through gaps, with particular emphasis on SMs and FPUs, this study investigated leakage of charge-neutralized, polydispersed, dried sodium-chloride aerosols across different brands of PPE. Different breathing rates, aerosol particle sizes, and gap sizes were considered. A few major findings of this study were: (a) leakage, is not a strong function of sub-micron aerosol size; (b) for the same gap size, leakage of aerosols through surgical respirators can often be higher than in SMs and FPUs; and (c) as the gap size increases, the increase in leakage through surgical respirators is higher compared for SMs and FPUs, implying that some SMs and FPUs that possess electret layers may be preferable to N95s that have not been fit-tested. The results obtained can also be used to explain conflicting findings from clinical studies on the effectiveness of SMs when compared to N95s and can be input into risk-assessment models to determine the increase in infection rate resulting from deployment of PPE under less-than-ideal conditions.",

  "27373689": "A novel, lineage - primed prestalk cell subtype involved in the morphogenesis of D. discoideum Dictyostelium morphogenesis requires the tip, which acts as an organizer and conducts orchestrated cell movement and cell differentiation. At the slug stage the tip region contains prestalk A (pstA) cells, which are usually recognized by their expression of reporter constructs that utilize a fragment of the promoter of the ecmA gene. Here, using the promoter region of the o-methyl transferase 12 gene (omt12) to drive reporter expression, we demonstrate the presence, also within the pstA region, of a novel prestalk cell subtype: the pstV(A) cells. Surprisingly, a sub-population of the vegetative cells express a pstV(A): GFP marker and, sort out to the tip, both when developing alone and when co-developed with an excess of unmarked cells. The development of such a purified GFP-marked population is greatly accelerated: by precocious cell aggregation and tip formation with accompanying precocious elevation of developmental gene transcription. We therefore suggest that the tip contains at least two prestalk cell subtypes: the developmentally - specified pstA cells and the lineage - primed pstV(A) cells. It is presumably the pstV(A) cells that play the dominant role in morphogenesis during the earlier stages of development. The basis for the lineage priming is, however, unclear because we can find no correlation between pstV(A) differentiation and nutrient status during growth or cell cycle position at the time of starvation, the two known determinants of probable cell fate.",
  "28127799": "TBL1XR1 predicts isolated tumor cells and micrometastasis in patients with TNM stage I/II colorectal cancer A considerable number of early stage colorectal cancer (CRC) patients may develop cancer relapse or metastasis after curative surgery. Isolated tumor cells (ITC) and micrometastasis in lymph nodes (LNMM), which are undetectable by conventional pathological examination, may be one primary reason. Detection of ITC / LNMM is time-consuming and cost-ineffective, we aimed to find biomarkers in primary CRC tissues to help predicting ITC / LNMM status. We enrolled 137 node-negative patients with early stage CRC in this study. Existence of ITC / LNMM was identified by immunohistological staining with cytokeratin 20 in resected lymph nodes. Expression of transducin (β)-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) in primary CRC tissues was also investigated. Chi-square test was performed to reveal the correlations between ITC / LNMM and clinicopathological characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine independent prognostic factors. Knock-down experiment together with proliferation and invasion assays were carried out to explore molecular mechanisms between TBL1XR1 and ITC / LNMM. 29.2% (40/137) patients were identified as ITC / LNMM positive and most of them (32/40 cases, 80%) showed high TBL1XR1 expression in primary CRC tissues. Both ITC / LNMM and TBL1XR1 expression were independent prognostic factors for disease relapse or metastasis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that TBL1XR1 can regulate the expression of VEGF-C and epithelial-mesenchymal transition proteins, thus mediate the process of lymph node metastasis. Identification of ITC / LNMM is significant in evaluating clinical outcome and guiding adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage CRC patients. TBL1XR1 overexpression in CRC tissues can serve as an efficient biomarker to predict the status of ITC / LNMM.",

Aim: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the short-term efficacy of a multi-component psychosocial intervention program for informal caregivers of persons with neurocognitive disorders in Alexandria, Egypt. Informal caregivers (120) were randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. The intervention group (60) participated in a multi-component program of 8 sessions, including psycho-education, group cognitive-behavioral therapy, and group social support. Program primary outcomes were assessed after program termination (post-1), and three months later (post-2). Measured outcomes included caregivers ' knowledge, depression and anxiety symptoms, and perceived burden. Caregivers ' depression, anxiety, and perceived burden demonstrated significant drop at post-1, and post-2 compared to the control group (P< 0.001). The intervention group showed significant negative absolute change on depression, anxiety, and perceived burden measures, while on the dementia -related knowledge measure, a significant positive absolute change was found at post-1, and post-2 (P< 0.001), in comparison to controls. All outcome measures recorded a large effect size; the highest was for knowledge (partial eta2 = 0.98), and the least was for perceived burden (partial eta2 = 0.71). A multi-component psychosocial intervention for caregivers of persons with neurocognitive disorders demonstrated a short-term efficacy in reducing their burden, depression, and anxiety, as well as improving caregivers ' knowledge.

  "28429775": "Fucoxanthin provides neuroprotection in models of traumatic brain injury via the Nrf2 - ARE and Nrf2 - autophagy pathways Fucoxanthin is abundant in seaweed and is considered as a powerful antioxidant. It has been proposed to possess anti-cancer, anti-obesity and anti-diabetes effects. However, its roles in brain injury models have not been fully understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the neuroprotection of fucoxanthin in models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the role of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)- antioxidant-response element (ARE) and Nrf2 - autophagy pathways in the putative neuroprotection. We found that fucoxanthin alleviated TBI -induced secondary brain injury, including neurological deficits, cerebral edema, brain lesion and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, the up-regulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were reversed by fucoxanthin treatment. Furthermore, our in vitro studies demonstrated that fucoxanthin increased the neuron survival and reduced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. In addition, fucoxanthin activated the Nrf2 - ARE pathway and autophagy both in vivo and in vitro, which was proven by the results of immunohistochemistry, western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). However, fucoxanthin failed to provide neuroprotection and activated autophagy following TBI in Nrf2 (-/-) mice. In conclusion, our studies indicated that fucoxanthin provided neuroprotective effects in models of TBI, potentially via regulation of the Nrf2 - ARE and Nrf2 - autophagy pathways.",

Human vaginal epithelial cells were transfected with HPV-11 L1 expression vector and siRNA - HPV-11 L1 vectors and a control group was transfected with scrambled siRNA. Cell proliferation in each group was analyzed using the MTT assay and the expression of apoptosis -associated proteins was measured by western blot analysis. Compared with the control group, HPV-11 L1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased following transfection with the HPV-11 L1 expression vector in cells (P<0.05), but this result was significantly reversed by silencing of HPV-11 L1 (P<0.05). In addition, cell proliferation in the HPV-11 group was lower than that in the control group; however, cell proliferation was significantly increased in cells transfected with silenced L1 compared with that in the control group (P<0.05). Furthermore, silencing of HPV-11 L1 significantly decreased caspase-3 and caspase-9 expressions in cells, whereas the expression was increased in the HPV-11 L1 group (P<0.05). The present study suggested that siRNA -mediated silencing of HPV-11 L1 may have potential therapeutic applications for treating gynecological diseases associated with HPV-11 infection.",
  "28199964": "Blockade of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibits the contractility and invasion potential of cancer stem like cells Recent studies have implicated the roles of cancer stem like cells (CSCs) in cancer metastasis. However, very limited knowledge exists at the molecular and cellular level to target CSCs for prevention of cancer metastasis. In this study, we examined the roles of contractile dynamics of CSCs in cell invasion and delineated the underlying molecular mechanisms of their distinct cell invasion potential. Using de-adhesion assay and atomic force microscopy, we show that CSCs derived from melanoma and breast cancer cell lines exhibit increased contractility compared to non-CSCs across all tumor types. In addition, CSCs possess increased ECM remodeling capacity as quantified by collagen degradation assay. More importantly, pharmacological blockade of Rho-associated protein kinase completely abolished the contractility and collagen degradation capacity of both CSCs and non-CSCs. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the importance of cell contractility in regulating invasiveness of CSCs and suggests that pharmacological targeting of ROCK pathway represents a novel strategy for targeting both CSCs and bulk population for the treatment of cancer metastasis.",
  "27809747": "MiR 221 / 222 as new players in tamoxifen resistance Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women. Despite advances in early detection and treatment, it has the second highest mortality rate after lung cancer. Around 85% of breast carcinomas are ER+; thus, antiestrogens like tamoxifen are beneficial. Although, tamoxifen is useful for many patients, plenty of patients respond poorly to initial therapy or recurrence occurs in about 30% of cases, because tamoxifen resistance happens. Drug resistance remains a major clinical obstacle to successful treatment of breast cancer and more than 90% of unsuccessful treatments are because of acquired resistance and MultiDrug Resistance (MDR) is a major contributor. MicroRNAs are members of a novel class of short noncoding RNAs. Besides to their various roles in gene expression, miRNAs are considered as important cancer therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Since 2005, when miRNA deregulation was first reported in breast cancer, more than 1000 reports have been published about miRNAs. Increasing number of studies showed the importance of miRNAs in antiestrogen therapy, especially on tamoxifen; thus, it is not surprising that these tiny molecules are involved in drug resistance. Due to the pivotal role of these known RNA molecules, in this review, we tried to illustrate the importance of the miRNAs as a new player in breast cancer pathogenesis. We have also focused on cancer drug resistance mechanisms highlighting the role of important oncomirs, miR 221 / 222, involved in cell cycle deregulation in breast cancer. The relationship between these oncomiRs with resistance to tamoxifen is also emphasized.",

However, controversy exists regarding whether AVFs are suitable for elderly patients. Single-center retrospective review to investigate the impact of age on AVF outcomes. Five hundred and twenty-five patients with AVF creation were stratified based on age <65, 65-75, and >75 years. AVF outcomes including primary failure, AVF patency (primary, secondary, and functional), and AVF complications were studied for 3 years following AVF creation. The cohort was 63% male, 44% Caucasian, and 55% had diabetes or cardiovascular disease. 39% were aged <65 years, 33% 65-75 years, and 28% were aged >75 years. No differences in rates of primary failure, loss of primary patency, complications, or need for intervention were observed between age groups. There was a significant association of age with secondary patency and functional patency, with age >75 being an independent risk factor for shortened lifespan of the fistula. For patients aged >75 years, secondary patency at 3 years was 64% compared to 75%-78% for younger patients. Functional patency at 2 years was 69% for those aged >75 years compared to 78%-81% for younger patients. We found no difference in AVF maturation, primary patency, complications, or interventions in those over the age of 75 compared to younger counterparts. While secondary and functional patency rates were significantly lower in those aged >75 years, the magnitude of difference is likely not clinically relevant. Therefore, we recommend that advanced age alone should not preclude patients from AVF creation.",
  "27733154": "Molecular profile of 5-fluorouracil pathway genes in colorectal carcinoma This study addresses involvement of major 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pathway genes in the prognosis of colorectal carcinoma patients. Testing set and two validation sets comprising paired tumor and adjacent mucosa tissue samples from 151 patients were used for transcript profiling of 15 5-FU pathway genes by quantitative real-time PCR and DNA methylation profiling by high resolution melting analysis. Intratumoral molecular profiles were correlated with clinical data of patients. Protein levels of two most relevant candidate markers were assessed by immunoblotting. Downregulation of DPYD and upregulation of PPAT, UMPS, RRM2, and SLC29A1 transcripts were found in tumors compared to adjacent mucosa in testing and validation sets of patients. Low RRM2 transcript level significantly associated with poor response to the first-line palliative 5-FU -based chemotherapy in the testing set and with poor disease-free interval of patients in the validation set irrespective of 5-FU treatment. UPP2 was strongly methylated while its transcript absent in both tumors and adjacent mucosa. DPYS methylation level was significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to adjacent mucosa samples. Low intratumoral level of UPB1 methylation was prognostic for poor disease-free interval of the patients (P = 0.0002). The rest of the studied 5-FU genes were not methylated in tumors or adjacent mucosa. The observed overexpression of several 5-FU activating genes and DPYD downregulation deduce that chemotherapy naïve colorectal tumors share favorable gene expression profile for 5-FU therapy. Low RRM2 transcript and UPB1 methylation levels present separate poor prognosis factors for colorectal carcinoma patients and should be further investigated.",

Approximately 10-20% of patients with keratoconus eventually require a corneal transplant. Corneal cross-linking (CXL) is a relatively new treatment that may help prevent the need for corneal transplantation. Here, we investigated whether the introduction of CXL has reduced the number of corneal transplants performed annually. Data regarding the transplantation procedures performed in patients under the age of 50 years were extracted from the Dutch National Organ Transplant Registry. The number of corneal transplants performed prior to (i.e. in 2005 through 2007) and following the introduction of CXL (i.e. in 2012 through 2014) were compared. Furthermore, a trend analysis on annual keratoplasties over time was performed. Approximately 25% fewer corneal transplants were performed in the 3- year period following the introduction of CXL compared to the 3- year period prior to the introduction of CXL (201 versus 269 transplants, respectively; p = 0.005). Age, gender and visual acuity were similar between the patient groups in the two time periods. Trend analysis also demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of corneal transplants (p = 0.001). Significantly fewer corneal transplants were performed for treating keratoconus following the nationwide introduction of CXL. This reduction suggests that corneal cross-linking can significantly reduce the need for corneal transplantation.",

Growing evidence has demonstrated that LDPs play important roles in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. However, the composition of liver LDPs and the role of their alterations in hepatosteatosis are not well-understood. In this study, we performed liver proteome and LD sub-proteome profiling to identify enriched proteins in LDs as LDPs, and quantified their changes in a high-fat diet (HFD)- induced fatty liver model. Among 5,000 quantified liver proteins, 101 were enriched by greater than 10-fold in the LD sub-proteome and were classified as LDPs. Differential profiling of LDPs in HFD - induced fatty liver provided a list of candidate LDPs for functional investigation. We tested the function of an upregulated LDP, S100a10, in vivo with adenovirus -mediated gene silencing and found, unexpectedly, that knockdown of S100a10 accelerated progression of HFD - induced liver steatosis. The S100A10 interactome revealed a connection between S100A10 and lipid transporting proteins, suggesting that S100A10 regulates the development and formation of LDs by transporting and trafficking. This study identified LD -enriched sub-proteome in homeostatic as well as HFD - induced fatty livers, providing a rich resource for the LDP research field.",

It can sometimes be fatal, particularly as a result of cardiac involvement such as congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to report a case of cardiogenic shock that occurred during refeeding in a patient with anorexia nervosa (AN). The cardiogenic shock was due to a previously unrecognized mechanism, namely a transient left midventricular obstruction that completely disappeared after treatment. A 46-y-old woman with AN who had followed a carbohydrate - and a fat - deficient diet for >10 y was hospitalized for dyspnea on exertion. She had severely impaired cardiac systolic function on admission and was considered high risk for refeeding syndrome. During a stepwise increase of calories, she showed no electrolyte or mineral abnormalities characteristic of refeeding syndrome. After intravenous administration of a fat emulsion, the patient suffered from cardiogenic shock due to an unexpected mechanism, namely a left midventricular obstruction caused by cardiac hypercontraction, a thickened left ventricular wall, and intravascular volume depletion. With cessation of the fat emulsion and initiation of volume repletion she recovered from shock immediately and her echocardiogram returned to normal by discharge. This case illustrated a novel cause of cardiogenic shock during refeeding and the need for caution during the intravenous administration of a fat emulsion in patients with initial left ventricular systolic dysfunction.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of low viscosity chitosan on S. epidermidis growth and biofilm formation. Methods and Results. The antibacterial and antibiofilm properties were investigated, during both planktonic growth and biofilm formation. This was performed using different concentrations in media and by coating on polystyrene surfaces. In addition, the bactericidal effect was investigated using a modified direct contact test. The results showed that low viscosity chitosan in media had both a bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect on planktonic growth and biofilm formation of S. epidermidis in a concentration dependent manner. Polystyrene discs coated with chitosan reduced both early biofilm formation (6 h) and late biofilm formation (18 h), as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The modified direct contact test showed a bactericidal effect. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that low viscosity chitosan has a bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against S. epidermidis and that the activity is dependent on the amount of chitosan added. In addition, low viscosity chitosan reduced biofilm formation both when added to media and when coated on polystyrene surfaces. Significance and Impact of Study.

Vascular mechanisms to compensate ischemia are regulated at various vascular scales with their superimposed perfusion pattern being hypothetically self-similar. Dedicated FA software (\" FraktalWandler \") has been developed. Fractal dimensions during first-pass (FDfirst-pass) and recirculation (FDrecirculation) are hypothesised to indicate the predominating pathomechanism and ischemic severity, respectively. Twenty-six patients with evidence of myocardial ischemia in 108 ischemic myocardial segments on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were analysed. The 40th and 60th percentiles of FDfirst-pass were used for pathomechanical classification, assigning lesions with FDfirst-pass ≤ 2.335 to predominating coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) and ≥2.387 to predominating coronary artery disease (CAD). Optimal classification point in ROC analysis was FDfirst-pass = 2.358. FDrecirculation correlated moderately with per cent diameter stenosis in invasive coronary angiography in lesions classified CAD (r = 0.472, p = 0.001) but not CMD (r = 0.082, p = 0.600). The ischemic transition region may provide information on pathomechanical composition and severity of myocardial ischemia. FA of this region is feasible and may improve diagnosis compared to traditional noninvasive myocardial perfusion analysis. • A novel hypothesis and method is introduced to pathophysiologically characterise myocardial ischemia. • The ischemic transition region appears a meaningful diagnostic target in perfusion imaging. • Fractal analysis may characterise pathomechanical composition and severity of myocardial ischemia.",
  "27465497": "Pivotal debates and controversies on the structure and function of the avian respiratory system: setting the record straight Among the extant air-breathing vertebrates, the avian respiratory system is structurally the most complex and functionally the most efficient gas exchanger. Having been investigated for over four centuries, some aspects of its biology have been extremely challenging and highly contentious and others still remain unresolved. Here, while assessing the most recent findings, four notable aspects of the structure and function of the avian respiratory system are examined critically to highlight the questions, speculations, controversies and debates that have arisen from past research. The innovative techniques and experiments that were performed to answer particular research questions are emphasised. The features that are outlined here concern the arrangement of the airways, the path followed by the inspired air, structural features of the lung and the air and blood capillaries, and the level of cellular defence in the avian respiratory system. Hitherto, based on association with the proven efficiency of naturally evolved and human-made counter-current exchange systems rather than on definite experimental evidence, a counter-current gas exchange system was suggested to exist in the avian respiratory system and was used to explain its exceptional efficiency. However, by means of an elegant experiment in which the direction of the air - flow in the lung was reversed, a cross-current system was shown to be in operation instead. Studies of the arrangement of the airways and the blood vessels corroborated the existence of a cross-current system in the avian lung. While the avian respiratory system is ventilated tidally, like most other invaginated gas exchangers, the lung, specifically the paleopulmonic parabronchi, is ventilated unidirectionally and continuously in a caudocranial (back-to-front) direction by synchronized actions of the air sacs. The path followed by the inspired air in the lung - air sac system is now known to be controlled by a mechanism of aerodynamic valving and not by anatomical valves or sphincters, as was previously supposed. The structural strength of the air and blood capillaries is derived from: the interdependence between the air and blood capillaries; a tethering effect between the closely entwined respiratory units; the presence of epithelial - epithelial cell connections (retinacula or cross-bridges) that join the blood capillaries while separating the air capillaries; the abundance and intricate arrangement of the connective tissue elements, i.e. collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle fibres; the presence of type-IV collagen, especially in the basement membranes of the blood-gas barrier and the epithelial - epithelial cell connections; and a putative tensegrity state in the lung. Notwithstanding the paucity of free surface pulmonary macrophages, the respiratory surface of the avian lung is well protected from pathogens and particulates by an assortment of highly efficient phagocytic cells. In commercial poultry production, instead of weak pulmonary cellular defence, stressful husbandry practices such as overcrowding, force-feeding, and intense genetic manipulation for rapid weight gain and egg production may account for the reported susceptibility of birds to aerosol - transmitted diseases.",

  "28537612": "Proline -rich antimicrobial peptides targeting protein synthesis Covering: up to 2017The innate immune system employs a broad array of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to attack invading microorganisms. While most AMPs act by permeabilizing the bacterial membrane, specific subclasses of AMPs have been identified that pass through membranes and inhibit bacterial growth by targeting fundamental intracellular processes. One such subclass is the proline -rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) that bind to the ribosome and interfere with the process of protein synthesis. A diverse range of PrAMPs have been identified in insects, such as bees, wasps and beetles, and crustaceans, such as crabs, as well as in mammals, such as cows, sheep, goats and pigs. Mechanistically, the best-characterized PrAMPs are the insect oncocins, such as Onc112, and bovine bactenecins, such as Bac7. Biochemical and structural studies have revealed that these PrAMPs bind within the ribosomal exit tunnel with a reverse orientation compared to a nascent polypeptide chain. The PrAMPs allow initiation but prevent the transition into the elongation phase of translation. Insight into the interactions of PrAMPs with their ribosomal target provides the opportunity to further develop these peptides as novel antimicrobial agents.",

We have previously shown the anti-inflammatory properties of TUDCA in an animal model of acute neuroinflammation. Here, we present a new anti-inflammatory mechanism of TUDCA through the regulation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. The bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected intravenously (iv) on TGFβ reporter mice (Smad-binding element (SBE)/Tk-Luc) to study in their brains the real-time activation profile of the TGFβ pathway in a non-invasive way. The activation of the TGFβ pathway in the brain of SBE/Tk-Luc mice increased 24 h after LPS injection, compared to control animals. This activation peak increased further in mice treated with both LPS and TUDCA than in mice treated with LPS only. The enhanced TGFβ activation in mice treated with LPS and TUDCA correlated with both an increase in TGFβ3 transcript in mouse brain and an increase in TGFβ3 immunoreactivity in microglia / macrophages, endothelial cells, and neurons. Inhibition of the TGFβ receptor with SB431542 drug reverted the effect of TUDCA on microglia / macrophages activation and on TGFβ3 immunoreactivity. Under inflammatory conditions, treatment with TUDCA enhanced further the activation of TGFβ pathway in mouse brain and increased the expression of TGFβ3. Therefore, the induction of TGFβ3 by TUDCA might act as a positive feedback, increasing the initial activation of the TGFβ pathway by the inflammatory stimulus. Our findings provide proof-of-concept that TGFβ contributes to the anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA under neuroinflammatory conditions.",

After analyzing the available literature on music festival health and safety, several major themes emerged. Principally, stakeholder groups planning in isolation from one another (ie, in silos) create fragmentation, gaps, and overlap in plans for major planned events (MPEs). The authors hypothesized that one approach to minimizing this fragmentation may be to create a framework to \"connect the dots,\" or join together the many silos of professionals responsible for safety, security, health, and emergency planning at MPEs. Adapted from the well-established literature regarding the management of cardiac arrests, both in and out of hospital, the \" chain of survival \" concept is applied to the disparate groups providing services that support event safety in the context of music festivals. The authors propose this framework for describing, understanding, coordinating and planning around the integration of safety, security, health, and emergency service for events. The adapted Event Chain of Survival contains six interdependent links, including: (1) event producers; (2) police and security; (3) festival health; (4) on-site medical services; (5) ambulance services; and (6) off-site medical services. The authors argue that adapting and applying this framework in the context of MPEs in general, and music festivals specifically, has the potential to break down the current disconnected approach to event safety, security, health, and emergency planning. It offers a means of shifting the focus from a purely reactive stance to a more proactive, collaborative, and integrated approach. Improving health outcomes for music festival attendees, reducing gaps in planning, promoting consistency, and improving efficiency by reducing duplication of services will ultimately require coordination and collaboration from the beginning of event production to post-event reporting.

  "28528555": "Development and Evaluation of the ADHD Cognitions Scale for Adults The clinical literature on ADHD in adults suggests that \" overly positive \" or optimistic cognitions may contribute to impairment and failure to use self-regulation skills in this population, yet the research literature on this topic is limited. We developed the ADHD Cognitions Scale (ACS), a brief self-report measure of ADHD -related thoughts, and evaluated its psychometric properties. We collected self-report measures, inculding the ACS, from two large community samples (Ns = 262, 304). The measure demonstrated a one-factor solution that replicated in the second sample. Evidence of good internal consistency and also convergent and divergent validity was obtained for both samples. Scores on the ACS correlated with functional impairment, time management problems, and avoidant coping strategies. With additional study, the ACS may be useful to identify and track maladaptive ADHD -related cognitions during cognitive-behavioral treatment, and to further study the role of these thoughts in ADHD -related impairment.",
  "28289109": "Minding the Gap: Factors Associated With Primary Care Coordination of Adults in 11 Countries Care coordination has been identified as a key strategy in improving the effectiveness, safety, and efficiency of the US health care system. Our objective was to determine whether population or health care system issues are associated with primary care coordination gaps in the United States and other high-income countries. We analyzed data from the 2013 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy (IHP) survey with multivariate logistic regression analysis. Respondents were adult primary care patients from 11 countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. Poor primary care coordination was defined as participants reporting at least 3 gaps in the coordination of care out of a maximum of 5. Analyses were based on 13,958 respondents. The rate of poor primary care coordination was 5.2% (724/13,958 respondents) overall and highest in the United States, at 9.8% (137/1,395 respondents). Multivariate regression analysis among all respondents found that they were less likely to experience poor primary care coordination if their primary care physician often or always knew their medical history, spent sufficient time, involved them, and explained things well (odds ratio = 0.6 for each). Poor primary care coordination was more likely to occur among patients with chronic conditions (odds ratios = 1.4-2.1 depending on number) and patients younger than 65 years (odds ratios = 1.6-2.3 depending on age-group). Among US respondents, insurance status, health status, household income, and sex were not associated with poor primary care coordination. The United States had the highest rate of poor primary care coordination among the 11 high-income countries evaluated. An established relationship with a primary care physician was significantly associated with better care coordination, whereas being chronically ill or younger was associated with poorer care coordination.",

Yet, their functions are largely uncharacterized. Current available databases lack in-depth information of ncRNA functions across spectrum of various cells / tissues. Here, we present FARNA, a knowledgebase of inferred functions of 10,289 human ncRNA transcripts (2,734 microRNA and 7,555 long ncRNA) in 119 tissues and 177 primary cells of human. Since transcription factors (TFs) and TF co-factors (TcoFs) are crucial components of regulatory machinery for activation of gene transcription, cellular processes and diseases in which TFs and TcoFs are involved suggest functions of the transcripts they regulate. In FARNA, functions of a transcript are inferred from TFs and TcoFs whose genes co-express with the transcript controlled by these TFs and TcoFs in a considered cell / tissue. Transcripts were annotated using statistically enriched GO terms, pathways and diseases across cells / tissues based on guilt-by-association principle. Expression profiles across cells / tissues based on Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) are provided. FARNA, having the most comprehensive function annotation of considered ncRNAs across widest spectrum of human cells / tissues, has a potential to greatly contribute to our understanding of ncRNA roles and their regulatory mechanisms in human.

Such a standard should improve public health without causing unintended serious consequences for sub-populations. This study evaluates the effect of progressive nicotine reduction in cigarettes on smoking behavior, toxicant exposure, and psychiatric symptoms in smokers with comorbid mood and/or anxiety disorders using a two-site, two-arm, double-blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in four phases over 34 weeks. Adult smokers (N = 200) of 5 or more cigarettes per day will be randomized across two sites (Penn State and Massachusetts General). Participants must have not had a quit attempt in the prior month, nor be planning to quit in the next 6 months, meet criteria for a current or lifetime unipolar mood and/or anxiety disorder based on the structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and must not have an unstable medical or psychiatric condition. After a week of smoking their own cigarettes, participants receive two weeks of Spectrum research cigarettes with usual nicotine content (11.6 mg). After this baseline period, participants will be randomly assigned to continue smoking Spectrum research cigarettes that contain either (a) Usual Nicotine Content (11.6 mg); or (b) Reduced Nicotine Content: the nicotine content per cigarette is progressively reduced from approximately 11.6 mg to 0.2 mg in five steps over 18 weeks. At the end of the randomization phase, participants will be offered the choice to either (a) quit smoking with assistance, (b) continue smoking free research cigarettes, or (c) return to purchasing their own cigarettes, for the final 12 weeks of the study. The primary outcome measure is blood cotinine; key secondary outcomes are: exhaled carbon monoxide, urinary total NNAL- 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol and 1-hydroxypyrene, oxidative stress biomarkers including 8-isoprostanes, measures of psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), smoking behavior and dependence (e.g., cigarette consumption, quit attempts), and health effects (e.g., blood pressure, respiratory symptoms). Results from this study will inform FDA on the potential effects of regulating the nicotine content of cigarettes and help determine whether smokers with mood and/or anxiety disorders can safely transition to significantly reduced nicotine content cigarettes.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of glycyrrhizic acid (GLA) could improve the development of lung fibrosis in irradiated animals. Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Group A rats received thoracic irradiation. Rats in group B received GLA and irradiation. Group C received GLA and no irradiation. Group D received no GLA and irradiation. GLA was administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg body weight using an intraperitoneal injection one hour before thoracic irradiation. Radiation therapy was delivered on a Cobalt-60 unit using a single fraction of 16 Gy. The animals were sacrificed at 32 weeks following thoracic irradiation. The lungs were dissected and blind histopathological evaluation was performed. Histopathologically, a decrease (statistically not significant) in the thickening of alveolar or bronchial wall, formation of fibrous bands, and superimposed collagen were noted in the animals in group B as compared to the animals in group A. In this experimental study, administration of GLA one hour before thoracic irradiation may be a protective agent against radiation-induced fibrosis in animals and this model could be used in future studies.",

It has been shown that the response of cells to OGD in the control includes two phases. The first phase was accompanied by an increase in the frequency of spontaneous synchronous Ca(2+)-oscillations (SSCO) in neurons and Ca(2+) - pulse in astrocytes. Spontaneous Ca(2+) events in astrocytes during ischemia in control experiments disappeared. The second phase started after a few minutes of OGD and looked like a sharp/avalanche, global synchronic (within 20 s) increase in [Ca(2+)]i in many cells. Within 1 h after OGD, a mass death of cells, primarily astrocytes, was observed. To study the protective action of the compounds, cells were incubated in the presence of the neuroprotective agents for 10-40 min or 24 h before ischemia. All the neuroprotective agents delayed a global [Ca(2+)]i increase during OGD or completely inhibited this process and increased cell survival.",

We undertook a skin biopsy at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after transplantation with JACE. By using electron microscopy we observed the engraftment process. In transmission electron microscope findings, we recognized the engraftment process of JACE. Keratinocytes matured gradually. Collagen fibers formed thick bundles in the dermis layer. In scanning electron microscope findings, we observed papillary dermis development on the artificial dermis. After managing wound bed preparation by using artificial dermis, we were able to recognize the good result of grafting JACE on meshed 6:1 split thickness autografts. This is because the auto dermis from autograft extended under the JACE, binding between JACE, and the dermis became strong.",

Cheeses were characterized for volatile compounds, color, mechanical variables, and sensory descriptors. Pasture type significantly affected most of the instrumental variables considered and, as a consequence, sensory properties were affected as well. Cheeses from the pasture characterized by a nutrient-rich vegetation type were higher in protein and lower in fat content. Furthermore, such cheeses, evaluated by a sensory panel, were more intense in color with a more pungent and less cow-like odor, in agreement with what found through instrumental analyses. Supplementation level resulted in less pronounced effects, limited to volatile compounds and texture properties, which were not detected by sensory analysis.

  "28495934": "How Should I Study for the Exam? Self-Regulated Learning Strategies and Achievement in Introductory Biology In college introductory science courses, students are challenged with mastering large amounts of disciplinary content while developing as autonomous and effective learners. Self-regulated learning (SRL) is the process of setting learning goals, monitoring progress toward them, and applying appropriate study strategies. SRL characterizes successful, \"expert\" learners, and develops with time and practice. In a large, undergraduate introductory biology course, we investigated: 1) what SRL strategies students reported using the most when studying for exams, 2) which strategies were associated with higher achievement and with grade improvement on exams, and 3) what study approaches students proposed to use for future exams. Higher - achieving students, and students whose exam grades improved in the first half of the semester, reported using specific cognitive and metacognitive strategies significantly more frequently than their lower - achieving peers. Lower - achieving students more frequently reported that they did not implement their planned strategies or, if they did, still did not improve their outcomes. These results suggest that many students entering introductory biology have limited knowledge of SRL strategies and/or limited ability to implement them, which can impact their achievement. Course -specific interventions that promote SRL development should be considered as integral pedagogical tools, aimed at fostering development of students ' lifelong learning skills.",

This study used ultrasonography to assess the flexor pollicis longus tendon and intermediate tissue. The study assessed 27 patients (28 wrists) who underwent removal of the volar locking plate. Before plate removal, radiography and ultrasonography were performed to assess the relation between the flexor pollicis longus tendon and the volar locking plate. Intraoperatively, the authors evaluated the intermediate tissues between the flexor pollicis longus tendon and the distal volar margin of the plate. Preoperative and intraoperative findings were compared. Intraoperative findings were strongly related to the distance between the flexor pollicis longus tendon and the volar locking plate on ultrasonography. The sensitivity of ultrasonography in detecting thin, membrane-like intermediate tissue through which the plate was visible was 95%, and the specificity was 89% if the distance between the flexor pollicis longus tendon and the plate was less than 0.7 mm. Compression of the flexor pollicis longus tendon was seen in 11 cases (39.3%), and this finding suggested the presence of thin, membrane-like intermediate tissue.

This delay is mainly attributable to thymic damage after myeloablative chemotherapy and radiotherapy METHODS: We established a model of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice and administered ghrelin (GRL) 7 days before the conditioning regimen or the day after BMT. All the GRL - treated mice, especially those administered GRL prior to the conditioning regimen, exhibited more intact thymic architecture and a more rapid restoration of CD4 T lymphocytes after BMT than those of the corresponding control mice. Moreover, the levels of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) were significantly higher in the mice treated with GRL prior to the conditioning regimen than in the control mice at 28 days after BMT.

  "27577957": "Adenosine arrests breast cancer cell motility by A3 receptor stimulation In neutrophils, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release and autocrine purinergic signaling regulate coordinated cell motility during chemotaxis. Here, we studied whether similar mechanisms regulate the motility of breast cancer cells. While neutrophils and benign human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) form a single leading edge, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells possess multiple leading edges enriched with A3 adenosine receptors. Compared to HMEC, MDA-MB-231 cells overexpress the ectonucleotidases ENPP1 and CD73, which convert extracellular ATP released by the cells to adenosine that stimulates A3 receptors and promotes cell migration with frequent directional changes. However, exogenous adenosine added to breast cancer cells or the A3 receptor agonist IB-MECA dose - dependently arrested cell motility by simultaneous stimulation of multiple leading edges, doubling cell surface areas and significantly reducing migration velocity by up to 75 %. We conclude that MDA-MB-231 cells, HMEC, and neutrophils differ in the purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate their motility patterns and that the subcellular distribution of A3 adenosine receptors in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells contributes to dysfunctional cell motility. These findings imply that purinergic signaling mechanisms may be potential therapeutic targets to interfere with the motility of breast cancer cells in order to reduce the spread of cancer cells and the risk of metastasis.",

Data at onset, three months, one, three, and five years after diagnosis and at transition, on HbA1c and clinical parameters, on 8084 patients in the Swedish pediatric quality registry, SWEDIABKIDS, were used. Of these patients, 26% had been referred to adult diabetes care by 2014. Children with HbA1c < 72 mmol/mol (8.7%) (20% of patients, low group) at diagnosis continued to have good metabolic control during childhood, in contrast to children with HbA1c > 114 mmol/mol (12.6%) (20% of patients, high group) at diagnosis, who continued to have high HbA1c at follow-up. For the individual, there was no significant correlation between high HbA1c at onset and during follow-up. During follow-up, children in the high group were more often smokers, less physically active, and more often had retinopathy than children in the low group (P < .01, .01, .03 respectively).

Within DBT, there are 6 explicitly defined validation strategies that range hierarchically from validation level (VL) 1 to VL 6. To date, there have been no studies on the frequency of use of VLs in actual DBT sessions. The aim of the current study was to explore DBT therapists ' use of VLs and examine the relationship between VLs and change in a client emotion during therapy sessions. DBT treatment sessions (n = 121) across 35 participants in a DBT training clinic were coded for therapist use of VLs. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess for change in therapist use of VLs over time and hierarchical linear modeling was used to correlate therapist use of these strategies with change in client emotion. Results indicated no significant relationship between overall frequency of VLs and change in client emotion. However, an increase in frequency of high VLs was associated with an increase in positive affect (PA) and a decrease in negative affect (NA) while an increase in frequency of low VLs was associated with a decrease in PA and no change in NA. An increase in frequency of VL 4 was associated with an increase in NA. VL 6 was associated with an increase in PA and a decrease in NA. Findings suggest that specific validation strategies may be related to session changes in affect and have implications for identifying potential mechanisms of change. (PsycINFO Database Record",

  "27754198": "JS ISH-ECCR-3 A NOVEL ALGORITHM FOR THE CASE DETECTION OF THE MOST COMMON FORM OF ENDOCRINE HYPERTENSION Primary aldosteronism (PA) involves more than 11% of patients referred to specialized hypertension centers and, therefore, is much more common than commonly held. Moreover, it causes a damage to the heart, blood vessels and kidneys, which translates into a high rate of cardiovascular events, in excess to the degree of blood pressure raise. Along with the notion that a timely diagnosis entails a fundamental step for the choice of an appropriate therapy, which can correct the arterial hypertension and the hypokalemia, this justifies efforts to search for PA in the majority of the patients with hypertension. Unfortunately, because of the lack of the classical signs, as spontaneous or drug-induced hypokalemia and related symptoms, PA deceives diagnosis in the majority of the cases .The identification of a curable form of primary aldosteronism can be beneficial particularly in some subgroups of patients, namely those with drug - resistant hypertension, who are at high risk of primary aldosteronism. An aggressive diagnostic approach is necessary in these patients, who can benefit most from an accurate diagnosis. Knowledge of the sodium intake and drug effects on the aldosterone-renin ratio is a key element for the diagnosis in these challenging cases .With the latest work-up endorsed by the Endocrine Society Guidelines and supported by the results of the AQUARR Study, the diagnostic algorithm for PA can be substantially simplified. This means skipping the so-called confirmatory tests in most cases and thus rendering the screening of PA feasible and affordable. Hence, most centers can nowadays exploit use of a cost - effective strategy to screen for patients with primary aldosteronism. At variance, the identification of primary aldosteronism subtypes, which involves adrenal vein sampling (AVS), should only be undertaken at tertiary referral centers that have experience in performing and interpreting this minimally invasive test .Overall, long-term cure biochemical cure can be consistently achieved when adrenalectomy is based on AVS - based identification of lateralized aldosterone excess. Moreover, long-term cure of hypertension, defined as no need for antihypertensive drug treatment, can be achieved in about 45% of the cases, with an additional 40% showing a marked improvement in blood pressure control. Lack of blood pressure normalization can be explained by misdiagnosis and/or concomitant essential hypertension.",

Costs related to productivity loss were estimate using data provided by the Brazilian National Health System (disability retirements) and absenteeism. Modifiable risk factors and unhealthy behaviors were assessed through interviews (physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and smoking) and clinical assessments (obesity). Smoking and physical inactivity affected significantly the amount of money lost with productivity losses related to absenteeism. The presence of obesity generated higher expenditures with disability retirement, while low back pain and sleep disorder were the most relevant confounders in multivariate models for disability retirement and absenteeism.

Between 1997 and 2000, 134 patients with non-inflammatory locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) were treated with PRT. The tumor dose was 45 Gy in 15 fractions to the breast and to regional lymph nodes over 6 weeks. Radical mastectomy was performed 6 weeks after PRT to all patients and adjuvant systemic therapy was administered as per protocol. The measures of disease outcome were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) which estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median follow-up was 74 months (range 4-216). Objective clinical tumor response after PRT was observed in 77.6% of the patients. Clinical complete tumor response (cCR) was achieved in 21.6% of the patients. Pathological CR in the breast was achieved in 15% of the patients. The 5- and 10- year OS were 55.1 and 37.8%, respectively. The 5- and 10- year DFS were 39.2 and 27%, respectively. Patients who achieved cCR had significantly longer OS in comparison with patients achieving clinical partial response (cPR) and clinical stable disease (cSD). Similarly, DFS of patients in the cCR group was longer compared with patients with cPR and cSD, yet without statistical significance. Our results showed that local control in LABC patients achieved by primary PRT, followed by radical mastectomy was comparable with the results reported in the literature. Complete pathologic response to PRT identified a subgroup of patients with a trend toward better DFS and OS.",
  "28078451": "Slower but not faster unilateral fatiguing knee extensions alter contralateral limb performance without impairment of maximal torque output The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of unilateral fatigue of the knee extensors at different movement velocities on neuromuscular performance in the fatigued and non-fatigued leg. Unilateral fatigue of the knee extensors was induced in 11 healthy young men (23.7 ± 3.8 years) at slower (60°/s; FAT60) and faster movement velocities (240°/s; FAT240) using an isokinetic dynamometer. A resting control (CON) condition was included. The fatigue protocols consisted of five sets of 15 maximal concentric knee extensions using the dominant leg. Before and after fatigue, peak isokinetic torque (PIT) and time to PIT (TTP) of the knee extensors as well as electromyographic (EMG) activity of vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and biceps femoris muscles were assessed at 60 and 240°/s movement velocities in the fatigued and non-fatigued leg. In the fatigue d leg, significantly greater PIT decrements were observed following FAT60 and FAT240 (11-19%) compared to CON (3-4%, p = .002, d = 2.3). Further, EMG activity increased in vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscle following FAT240 only (8-28%, 0.018 ≤ p ≤ .024, d = 1.8). In the non-fatigued leg, shorter TTP values were found after the FAT60 protocol (11-15%, p = .023, d = 2.4). No significant changes were found for EMG data in the non-fatigued leg. The present study revealed that both slower and faster velocity fatiguing contractions failed to show any evidence of cross-over fatigue on PIT. However, unilateral knee extensor fatigue protocols conducted at slower movement velocities (i.e., 60°/s) appear to modulate torque production on the non-fatigued side (evident in shorter TTP values).",
  "27634880": "Evidence that vitronectin is a potent migration-enhancing factor for cancer cells chaperoned by fibrinogen: a novel view of the metastasis of cancer cells to low- fibrinogen lymphatics and body cavities Diluted (1%) plasma induces migration of malignant cell lines much more strongly than potent pro-metastatic factors. To characterize the factor(s) present in diluted plasma responsible for this phenomenon we performed i) heat inactivation, ii) dialysis, iii) proteinase K treatment, and iv) molecular size filtration studies. We found that this remarkable pro-migratory activity of diluted normal plasma is associated with a ~50-100-kD protein that interacts with GαI protein-coupled receptors and activates p42/44 MAPK and AKT signaling in target cells. Since this pro-migratory activity of 1% plasma decreases at higher plasma concentrations (> 20%), but is retained in serum, we hypothesized that fibrinogen may be involved as a chaperone of the protein(s). To identify the pro-migratory protein(s) present in diluted plasma and fibrinogen -depleted serum, we performed gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We identified several putative protein candidates that were further tested in in vitro experiments. We found that this pro-migratory factor chaperoned by fibrinogen is vitronectin, which activates uPAR, and that this effect can be inhibited by fibrinogen. These results provide a novel mechanism for the metastasis of cancer cells to lymphatics and body cavities, in which the concentration of fibrinogen is low, and thus suggests that free vitronectin stimulates migration of tumor cells.",
  "28117729": "The Association between Warning Label Requirements and Cigarette Smoking Prevalence by Education-Findings from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) The Guidelines for the implementation of Article 11 of the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) require that cigarette health warning labels should include pictures and take up 50% or more of the principal display area. This study examined how the association between large pictorial warnings, those covering ≥50% of the front and back of the package, and the prevalence of cigarette smoking varies by educational attainment. We pooled individual-level tobacco use data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) in 18 countries between 2008 and 2013 and linked them with warning label requirements during the same period from the MPOWER database and reports regarding warnings. The respondents ' self-reported exposure to warnings was examined according to education. Logistic regressions were further employed to analyze education- specific associations between large pictorial warnings and smoking prevalence, and whether such association differed by education was examined using an interaction test. At the time of the survey, eight out of 18 countries had imposed graphic warning labels that covered ≥50% of the package. These warnings were associated with a 10.0% (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.97; p ≤ 0.01) lower cigarette smoking prevalence among adults with less than a secondary education or no formal education, but not among respondents with at least a secondary education. Less educated respondents were also less likely to be exposed to warnings in all 18 countries. The association between strong warnings and lower smoking prevalence among less educated respondents could be greater if their exposure to warnings increases. Prominent pictorial warning labels can potentially reduce health disparities resulting from smoking across different education levels.",

We examined factors associated with negative psychological consequences of a breast cancer diagnosis, in a diverse sample of 910 recently diagnosed patients (378 African-American, 372 White, and 160 Latina). Patients completed an in-person interview as part of the Breast Cancer Care in Chicago study within an average of four months from diagnosis. The Cockburn negative psychological consequences of breast cancer screening scale was revised to focus on a breast cancer diagnosis. Path analysis assessed predictors of psychological consequences and potential mediators between race / ethnicity and psychological consequences. Compared to White counterparts, bivariate analysis showed African-American (β = 1.4, p < 0.05) and Latina (β = 3.6, p < 0.001) women reported greater psychological consequences. Strongest predictors (P < 0.05 for all) included unmet social support (β = 0.38), and provider trust (β = 0.12), followed by stage at diagnosis (β = 0.10) and perceived neighborhood social disorder (β = 0.09).The strongest mediator between race / ethnicity and psychological consequences was unmet social support. African-American and Latina women reported greater psychological consequences related to their breast cancer diagnosis; this disparity was mediated by differences in unmet social support. Social support represents a promising point of intervention.",
  "28337281": "C-MYC - induced upregulation of lncRNA SNHG12 regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration in triple-negative breast cancer Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, with a significantly higher recurrence and mortality rate. There is an urgent need to uncover the mechanism underlying TNBC and establish therapeutic targets. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a series of biological functions and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of cancer. Based on their expression specificity and large number, lncRNAs are likely to serve as the basis for clinical applications in oncology. In our previous study, we utilized RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to explore the lncRNAs expression profiles in TNBC and identified that small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) was remarkably increased in TNBC. However, the role of SNHG12 in TNBC has not been clarified. Herein, we determine that SNHG12 is upregulated in TNBC, and its high expression is significantly correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Mechanistic investigations show that SNHG12 is a direct transcriptional target of c-MYC. Silencing SNHG12 expression inhibits TNBC cells proliferation and apoptosis promotion, whereas SNHG12 overexpression has the opposite effect. In addition, we reveal that SNHG12 may promote cells migration by regulating MMP13 expression. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report indicating that SNHG12 is involved in breast cancer. Taken together, our findings suggest that SNHG12 contributes to the oncogenic potential of TNBC and may be a promising therapeutic target.",
  "28034730": "Association between postpartum depression and the practice of exclusive breastfeeding in the first three months of life To investigate the association between postpartum depression and the occurrence of exclusive breastfeeding. This is a cross-sectional study conducted in the states of the Northeast region, during the vaccination campaign in 2010. The sample consisted of 2583 mother - child pairs, with children aged from 15 days to 3 months. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to screen for postpartum depression. The outcome was lack of exclusive breastfeeding, defined as the occurrence of this practice in the 24h preceding the interview. Postpartum depression was the explanatory variable of interest and the covariates were: socioeconomic and demographic conditions; maternal health care; prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care; and the child's biological factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to control for possible confounding factors. Exclusive breastfeeding was observed in 50.8% of the infants and 11.8% of women had symptoms of postpartum depression. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a higher chance of exclusive breastfeeding absence was found among mothers with symptoms of postpartum depression (OR=1.67; p<0.001), among younger subjects (OR=1.89; p<0.001), those who reported receiving benefits from the Bolsa Família Program (OR=1.25; p=0.016), and those started antenatal care later during pregnancy (OR=2.14; p=0.032). Postpartum depression contributed to reducing the practice of exclusive breastfeeding. Therefore, this disorder should be included in the prenatal and early postpartum support guidelines for breastfeeding, especially in low socioeconomic status women.",

In the present study, we investigated a series of PEs extracted from JCL seed kernels with methanol (MeOH), and identified more than seven components contained in the PEs. The isolation of main five components of a series of PEs was revised using a semi-preparative reversed phase HPLC analysis of ODS-3 column. The five peaks of components were successfully isolated, and peaks of J2, J3, J5, and J7 were assigned to be Jatropha factors C1, C2, C3, and C4/5, but J6 was a mixture of Jatropha factor C6 and its isomer based on the data of UV and LC-MS / MS, and J2 was identified using (1)H NMR analysis. By characterization using LC-MS / MS analysis, all components of a series of PEs were elucidated to be the 12-deoxy-16-hydroxyphorbol esters composed of isomeric form of dicarboxylic groups with same m/z value of 380.",
  "28499113": "Social and Individual-Level Predictors of Alcohol Use Initiation and Escalation: Replicating and Extending Tests of Differential Effects Although alcohol use is considered a developmental phenomenon, there is a relative dearth of studies disaggregating predictors of alcohol use initiation versus early escalation of drinking. One perspective that has emerged is that social levels of influence may be relevant for the initiation of drinking, whereas individual levels of influence may be relevant for the early escalation in level of drinking among initiators, which we refer to as the specificity hypothesis. A sample of alcohol - naive youth (n = 944; mean age = 12.16 years, SD = 0.96) was prospectively assessed for 3 years, spanning six waves of data collection. Both social (parental conflict, perceived prevalence of peer drinking) and individual-level (higher sensation seeking) variables uniquely predicted increases in the likelihood of alcohol initiation. Likewise, both social (perceived descriptive norms of peer drinking) and individual-level (lower school grades, higher sensation seeking) variables uniquely predicted escalation in level of drinking among initiators (although only marginally for sensation seeking). Overall, there was little support for the specificity hypothesis. Our findings suggest that to assume that social and individual-level processes differentially predict drinking outcomes may be a false dichotomy. Theoretical work may benefit from drawing from developmental models emphasizing the interplay between individual and environmental factors in the prediction of the early development of drinking. The emergence of drinking behaviors is likely to result from a developmental cascade of interacting variables that make the ontogeny of drinking unlikely to emerge from a single class of variables.",
  "27511456": "Quantification of intact plasma AGT consisting of oxidized and reduced conformations using a modified ELISA The pleiotropic actions of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) depend on the availability of angiotensinogen (AGT) which generates angiotensin I (ANG I) when cleaved by renin. Thus, quantification of the intact AGT (iAGT) concentrations is important to evaluate the actual renin substrate available. The iAGT conformation exists as oxidized AGT (oxi-AGT) and reduced AGT (red-AGT) in a disulfide bond, and oxi-AGT has a higher affinity for renin, which may exacerbate RAS - associated diseases. Accordingly, we determined iAGT, oxi-AGT, and red-AGT levels in plasma from rats and mice. Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture and then immediately mixed with an inhibitor solution containing a renin inhibitor. Total AGT (tAGT) levels were measured by tAGT ELISA which detects both cleaved and iAGT. iAGT levels were determined by iAGT ELISA which was found to only detect red-AGT. Thus, it was necessary to treat samples with dithiothreitol, a reducing agent, to quantify total iAGT concentration. tAGT levels in rat and mouse plasma were 1,839 ± 139 and 1,082 ± 77 ng/ml, respectively. iAGT levels were 53% of tAGT in rat plasma but only 22% in mouse plasma, probably reflecting the greater plasma renin activity in mice. The ratios of oxi-AGT and red-AGT were ∼4:1 (rat) and 16:1 (mouse). Plasma iAGT consists of oxi-AGT and red-AGT, suggesting that oxidative stress can influence ANG I generation by the AGT conformation switch. Furthermore, the lower availability of plasma iAGT in mice suggests that it may serve as a limiting factor in ANG I formation in this species.",
  "27890470": "sGC stimulators: Evidence for riociguat beyond groups 1 and 4 pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a chronic cardiopulmonary disorder that if left untreated, progresses rapidly and is ultimately fatal. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified PH into 5 distinct groups according to pathophysiology, hemodynamic characteristics, and clinical presentation. Dysfunction in the nitric oxide (NO) pathway plays a key role in the pulmonary hypertension disease process, including in WHO Groups 2 and 3 PH. PH is associated with endothelial dysfunction, impaired synthesis of NO, and insufficient stimulation of the NO-soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, which reduces cGMP production. cGMP regulates vascular tone, cellular proliferation, inflammation, and fibrosis and its depletion can lead to a variety of abnormalities, including pulmonary vasoconstriction, impaired vascular remodeling, and in situ thrombosis. This review will examine a novel class of drugs called sGC stimulators which directly stimulate sGC independently of NO, leading to increased production of cGMP.",
  "28544601": "The impact of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features on the performance of the Afirma gene expression classifier A recent revision in thyroid tumor nomenclature has resulted in a change from a malignant diagnosis (noninvasive follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma) to one that is nonmalignant (noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features [NIFTP]). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the impact of this change on the performance of the Afirma gene expression classifier (GEC). The authors retrospectively analyzed consecutive thyroid fine-needle aspiration specimens with indeterminate diagnoses on which GEC was performed. Surgical pathology material was reviewed with the reclassification of nodules into NIFTP. GEC testing was performed on 384 fine-needle aspiration specimens diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) (304 cases) and suspicious for a follicular neoplasm (SFN) (80 cases) and yielded a suspicious result in 152 of the AUS cases (50%) and 50 of the SFN cases (63%). Thyroidectomy was performed on 177 patients. After reclassifying NIFTP, the positive predictive value of GEC decreased from 42% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 39%-45%) to 24% (95% CI, 22%-26%) in the AUS group and from 23% (95% CI, 19%-27%) to 13% (95% CI, 9%-18%) in the SFN group. Total thyroidectomy was performed more frequently than a partial thyroidectomy in patients with AUS with a suspicious GEC result compared with pre-GEC controls (68% vs 49%; P = .037). Reclassification of NIFTP significantly decreases the positive predictive value of GEC in indeterminate thyroid nodules. Nevertheless, the majority of patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules with a suspicious GEC result in the study institution have undergone total thyroidectomy. This finding raises concerns over reliance on a suspicious GEC result by clinicians to justify total thyroidectomy. Cancer Cytopathol 2017. © 2017 American Cancer Society.",

We analyzed family dietary intake according to the head of household's perception of satisfaction with food consumed by the family. Households (n = 13,351) that participated in the Brazilian Household Budget Survey and the National Dietary Survey were classified as satisfied or dissatisfied with the food consumed in the home. We compared the family dietary intake of the two groups considering their socio-demographic characteristics. Satisfied families (n = 4429) reported statistically higher intake (in grams/1000 kcal) of vegetables (47.3 vs 33.7), fruits (46.9 vs 21.4), sugar-sweetened beverages (118 vs 71.7), milk and dairy (57.9 vs 34.6), and ultra-processed products (18.6 vs 9.8); and lower intake of rice (86.2 vs 112), beans (91.7 vs 136), and meat (76.5 vs 84.0) when compared to dissatisfied families (n = 1717). Among satisfied families, in the youngest group we found lower consumption of fruits and higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed products when compared to the oldest group. Also among satisfied families, those in the highest per capita income group presented higher intake of fruits and lower intake of beans than those in the lowest income group. Satisfied families in the highest income group also consumed more fruits and less beans than dissatisfied families in the same income group. Socio-demographic characteristics may influence perception of satisfaction with food consumed and potentially influence the success of public health efforts to offer nutrition guidance for families satisfied with diets that may or may not be comprised of healthy food and beverages.",

A descriptive analysis of eligibility criteria of Dutch dementia research protocols A substantial proportion of dementia patients are excluded from research participation, while for extrapolation of the study findings, it is important that the research population represents the patient population. The aim of this study is to provide an analysis of dementia research and its exclusion criteria in order to get a clearer picture whether the research participants represent the general dementia population. Dementia studies registered at ToetsingOnline.nl between 2006-2015 were analysed. Study characteristics, funding and eligibility criteria were described and analysed using a standardised score sheet. The search yielded 103 usable study protocols. The number of trials has increased over the years, and 35% of the studies were industry - financed. Alzheimer's disease was the most researched type of dementia (84%). In observational studies the most frequently observed exclusion criterion is a neurological condition, while in drug studies and other intervention studies this is a somatic condition. Of all protocols, 86% had at least one exclusion criterion concerning comorbidity. Most studies focused on mild or moderate dementia (78%). Our study has shown that the distribution of dementia research over the different subtypes of dementia does not correspond with the prevalence of these subtypes in clinical practice. The research population in the protocols is not representative of the larger patient population. A greater number of dementia patients could derive benefit from the conducted research if the research agenda were more closely aligned with disease prevalence. A better representation of all dementia patients in research will help to meet the needs of these patients.",
  "27371817": "Metabolomic analysis of glycerophospholipid signatures of inflammation treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -induced- RAW264.7 cells using (1)H NMR and U-HPLC / Q-TOF-MS Non-destructive proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy and highly sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (U-HPLC / Q-TOF-MS) coupled to data processing methods were applied to analyze the metabolic profiling changes of glycerophospholipids (GPLs) in RAW264.7 cells from inflammation to prognosis. Analysis of (1)H NMR was shown that the models were grouped successfully, illustrating that all of them had significant differences. Based on the highly simple, accurate, non-targeted and non-destructively advantages of (1)H NMR, it could be used as a new screening tool of anti-inflammatory drugs in the metabolic profiling of GPLs. 58 GPLs were identified by U-HPLC / Q-TOF-MS, and 19 components were firstly identified in this study compared with our previous results. In addition, ten potential biomarkers were proved, of which phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:0/18:1) and (18:0/18:1) changed consistently in three drug-induced groups and might be the important biomarkers. Compared with (1)H NMR, U-HPLC / Q-TOF-MS showed higher sensitivity and specificity and was more suitable for the determination of biomarkers apart from the deficiency of time-consuming sample preparation steps and unambiguous metabolite identification. Therefore, it is feasible to analyze the changes of GPLs during inflammation by combining (1)H NMR spectroscopy with U-HPLC / Q-TOF-MS. The metabolic profiling of GPLs provides valuable evidence for inflammation diagnosis and prognosis, and might unravel the mechanisms involved in inflammation progression.",
  "27848238": "A Tractable Method for Measuring Nanomaterial Risk Using Bayesian Networks While control banding has been identified as a suitable framework for the evaluation and the determination of potential human health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials (NMs), the approach currently lacks any implementation that enjoys widespread support. Large inconsistencies in characterisation data, toxicological measurements and exposure scenarios make it difficult to map and compare the risk associated with NMs based on physicochemical data, concentration and exposure route. Here we demonstrate the use of Bayesian networks as a reliable tool for NM risk estimation. This tool is tractable, accessible and scalable. Most importantly, it captures a broad span of data types, from complete, high quality data sets through to data sets with missing data and/or values with a relatively high spread of probability distribution. The tool is able to learn iteratively in order to further refine forecasts as the quality of data available improves. We demonstrate how this risk measurement approach works on NMs with varying degrees of risk potential, namely, carbon nanotubes, silver and titanium dioxide. The results afford even non-experts an accurate picture of the occupational risk probabilities associated with these NMs and, in doing so, demonstrated how NM risk can be evaluated into a tractable, quantitative risk comparator.",

The Need for Evidence -Based Oversight of Infant Nutritional Supplement Claims The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) model recognizes growth in infancy and childhood as a fundamental determinant of lifespan health. Evidence of long-term health risks among small neonates who subsequently grow rapidly poses a challenge for interventions aiming to support healthy growth, not merely drive weight gain. Defining healthy growth beyond \"getting bigger\" is essential as infant and young child feeding industries expand. Liquid -based nutritional supplements, originally formulated for undernourished children, are increasingly marketed for and consumed by children generally. Clarifying the nature of the evidentiary base on which structure/function claims promoting \" healthy growth \" are constructed is important to curb invalid generalizations. Evidence points to changing social beliefs and cultural practices surrounding supplementary feeding, raising specific concerns about the long-term health consequences of an associated altered feeding culture, including reduced dietary variety and weight gain. Reassessing the evidence for and relevance of dietary supplements' \" promoting healthy growth \" claims for otherwise healthy children is both needed in a time of global obesity and an opportunity to refine intervention approaches among small children for whom rapid subsequent growth in early life augments risk for chronic disease.

  "27908503": "Cobalt-60 Machines and Medical Linear Accelerators: Competing Technologies for External Beam Radiotherapy Medical linear accelerators (linacs) and cobalt-60 machines are both mature technologies for external beam radiotherapy. A comparison is made between these two technologies in terms of infrastructure and maintenance, dosimetry, shielding requirements, staffing, costs, security, patient throughput and clinical use. Infrastructure and maintenance are more demanding for linacs due to the complex electric componentry. In dosimetry, a higher beam energy, modulated dose rate and smaller focal spot size mean that it is easier to create an optimised treatment with a linac for conformal dose coverage of the tumour while sparing healthy organs at risk. In shielding, the requirements for a concrete bunker are similar for cobalt-60 machines and linacs but extra shielding and protection from neutrons are required for linacs. Staffing levels can be higher for linacs and more staff training is required for linacs. Life cycle costs are higher for linacs, especially multi-energy linacs. Security is more complex for cobalt-60 machines because of the high activity radioactive source. Patient throughput can be affected by source decay for cobalt-60 machines but poor maintenance and breakdowns can severely affect patient throughput for linacs. In clinical use, more complex treatment techniques are easier to achieve with linacs, and the availability of electron beams on high - energy linacs can be useful for certain treatments. In summary, there is no simple answer to the question of the choice of either cobalt-60 machines or linacs for radiotherapy in low- and middle-income countries. In fact a radiotherapy department with a combination of technologies, including orthovoltage X-ray units, may be an option. Local needs, conditions and resources will have to be factored into any decision on technology taking into account the characteristics of both forms of teletherapy, with the primary goal being the sustainability of the radiotherapy service over the useful lifetime of the equipment.",
  "28408903": "Anti-bacterial and Anti-biofilm Evaluation of Thiazolopyrimidinone Derivatives Targeting the Histidine Kinase YycG Protein of Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most important opportunistic pathogens in nosocomial infections. The main pathogenicity associated with S. epidermidis involves the formation of biofilms on implanted medical devices, biofilms dramatically decrease the efficacy of conventional antibiotics and the host immune system. This emphasizes the urgent need for designing novel anti-staphylococcal biofilm agents. Based on the findings that compound 5, targeting the histidine kinase domain of S. epidermidis YycG, possessed bactericidal activity against staphylococci, 39 derivatives of compound 5 with intact thiazolopyrimidinone core structures were newly designed, 7 derivatives were further screened to explore their anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activities. The seven derivatives strongly inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus in the minimal inhibitory concentration range of 1.56-6.25 μM. All the derivatives reduced the proportion of viable cells in mature biofilms. They all displayed low cytotoxicity on mammalian cells and were not hemolytic to human erythrocytes. The biofilm inhibition activities of four derivatives (H5-32, H5-33, H5-34, and H5-35) were further investigated under shearing forces, they all led to significant decreases in the biofilm formation of S. epidermidis. These results were suggestive that the seven derivatives of compound 5 have the potential to be developed into agents for eradicating biofilm -associated infections.",
  "28399722": "Safety and function of a prototype microprocessor -controlled knee prosthesis for low active transfemoral amputees switching from a mechanic knee prosthesis: a pilot study Aim of this pilot study was to assess safety and functioning of a microprocessor -controlled knee prosthesis (MPK) after a short familiarization time and no structured physical therapy. Five elderly, low-active transfemoral amputees who were fitted with a standard non-microprocessor controlled knee prosthesis (NMPK) performed a baseline measurement consisting of a 3 D gait analysis, functional tests and questionnaires. The first follow-up consisted of the same test procedure and was performed with the MPK after 4 to 6 weeks of familiarization. After being refitted to their standard NMPK again, the subjects undertook the second follow-up which consisted of solely questionnaires 4 weeks later. Questionnaires and functional tests showed an increase in the perception of safety. Moreover, gait analysis revealed more physiologic knee and hip extension/flexion patterns when using the MPK. Our results showed that although the Genium with Cenior-Leg ruleset-MPK (GCL-MPK) might help to improve several safety -related outcomes as well as gait biomechanics the functional potential of the GCL-MPK may have been limited without specific training and a sufficient acclimation period. Implications for Rehabilitation Elderly transfemoral amputees are often limited in their activity by safety issues as well as insufficient functioning regarding the non microprocessor -controlled knee prostheses (NMPK), thing that could be eliminated with the use of suitable microprocessor -controlled prostheses (MPK). The safety and functioning of a prototype MPK (GCL-MPK) specifically designed for the needs of older and low-active transfemoral amputees was assessed in this pilot study. The GCL-MPK showed indicators of increased safety and more natural walking patterns in older and low-active transfemoral amputees in comparison to the standard NMPK already after a short acclimatisation time and no structured physical therapy. Regarding functional performance it seems as if providing older and low-active transfemoral amputees with the GCL-MPK alone without prescribing structured prosthesis training might be insufficient to achieve improvements over the standard NMPKs.",
  "27858508": "Activation of transcription enforces the formation of distinct nuclear bodies in zebrafish embryos Nuclear bodies are cellular compartments that lack lipid bilayers and harbor specific RNAs and proteins. Recent proposals that nuclear bodies form through liquid-liquid phase separation leave the question of how different nuclear bodies maintain their distinct identities unanswered. Here we investigate Cajal bodies (CBs), histone locus bodies (HLBs) and nucleoli - involved in assembly of the splicing machinery, histone mRNA 3' end processing, and rRNA processing, respectively - in the embryos of the zebrafish, Danio rerio. We take advantage of the transcriptional silence of the 1-cell embryo and follow nuclear body appearance as zygotic transcription becomes activated. CBs are present from fertilization onwards, while HLB and nucleolar components formed foci several hours later when histone genes and rDNA became active. HLB formation was blocked by transcription inhibition, suggesting nascent histone transcripts recruit HLB components like U7 snRNP. Surprisingly, we found that U7 base-pairing with nascent histone transcripts was not required for localization to HLBs. Rather, the type of Sm ring assembled on U7 determined its targeting to HLBs or CBs; the spliceosomal Sm ring targeted snRNAs to CBs while the specialized U7 Sm-ring localized to HLBs, demonstrating the contribution of protein constituents to the distinction among nuclear bodies. Thus, nucleolar, HLB, and CB components can mix in early embryogenesis when transcription is naturally or artificially silenced. These data support a model in which transcription of specific gene loci nucleates nuclear body components with high specificity and fidelity to perform distinct regulatory functions.",
  "27639988": "Pharmacogenetic reactivation of the original engram evokes an extinguished fear memory Fear memory extinction has several characteristic behavioral features, such as spontaneous recovery, renewal, and reinstatement, suggesting that extinction training does not erase the original association between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US). However, it is unclear whether reactivation of the original physical record of memory (i.e., memory trace) is sufficient to produce conditioned fear response after extinction. Here, we performed pharmacogenetic neuronal activation using transgenic mice expressing hM3Dq DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) under the control of the activity - dependent c-fos gene promoter. Neuronal ensembles activated during fear - conditioned learning were tagged with hM3Dq and subsequently reactivated after extinction training. The mice exhibited significant freezing, even when the fear memory was no longer triggered by external CS, indicating that the artificial reactivation of a specific neuronal ensemble was sufficient to evoke the extinguished fear response. This freezing was not observed in non-fear-conditioned mice expressing hM3dq in the same brain areas. These results directly demonstrated that at least part of the original fear memory trace remains after extinction, and such residual plasticity might reflect the persistent memory.",

Generalized procrustes analysis (GPA), principal component analysis (PCA), and regression analysis were used to develop a parametric ribcage model, which can predict nodal locations of the template mesh according to age, sex, height, and body mass index (BMI). Two regression models, a quadratic model for estimating the ribcage size and a linear model for estimating the ribcage shape, were developed. The results showed that the ribcage size was dominated by the height (p=0.000) and age - sex - interaction (p=0.007) and the ribcage shape was significantly affected by the age (p=0.0005), sex (p=0.0002), height (p=0.0064) and BMI (p=0.0000). Along with proper assignment of cortical bone thickness, material properties and failure properties, this parametric ribcage model can directly serve as the mesh of finite element ribcage models for quantifying effects of human characteristics on thoracic injury risks.",

We aimed to develop and validate a 10-year mortality prediction model for older adults using data from developed and developing countries. We used data from five cohorts, including data from 16 developed and developing countries: ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Aging), HRS (Health and Retirement Study), MHAS (Mexican Health and Aging Study), SABE-Sao Paulo (The Health, Well-being and Aging), and SHARE (Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe). 35,367 older adults were split into training (two thirds) and test (one third) data sets. Baseline predictors included age, sex, comorbidities, and functional and cognitive measures. We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis using a sex-stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with time to death as the time scale. We validated the model using Harrell's C statistic (discrimination) and the estimated slope between observed and predicted 10-year mortality risk across deciles of risk (calibration). During a median of 8.6 years, 8,325 participants died. The final model included age, sex, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, cancer, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, physical activity, self-reported health, difficulty with bathing, walking several blocks, and reporting date correctly. The model showed good discrimination (Harrell's C = 0.76) and calibration (slope = 1.005). Models for developed versus developing country cohorts performed equally well when applied to data from developing countries. A parsimonious mortality prediction model using data from multiple cohorts in developed and developing countries can be used to predict mortality in older adults in both settings.",

A sample of 125 children, ranging in age from 0-17 years, among seven group homes (group A) was compared with 121 children of the general population we (group B). To evaluate nutritional status, BMI percentiles were used. Mean percentiles of both groups were compared through statistical analysis. Both nutritional and caloric daily distributions in each organization were obtained using the 24-hour recall method. A specific questionnaire was administered to evaluate Food Security. From the analysis of mean BMI -for- age (or height-for-length) percentiles, did not observe statistically significant differences between group A and group B. The average daily nutrient and calorie distribution in group homes proves to be nearly optimal with the exception of a slight excess in proteins and a slight deficiency in PUFAs. Moreover, a low intake of iron and calcium was revealed. All organizations obtained a \" High Food Security \" profile. Nutritional conditions of foster children are no worse than that of children of the general population. Foster care provides the necessary conditions to support their growth.",

Retrospective cohort study with patients serving as their own controls. Large, academic, tertiary care hospital. Forty-five patients with ADHF who had an inadequate response to high-dose loop diuretics and then received at least one dose of oral metolazone 5 mg or greater (metolazone index dose) followed by at least one dose of intravenous chlorothiazide 500 mg (chlorothiazide index dose) if the response to metolazone was considered inadequate, according to the institutional protocol, between February 4, 2013, and February 28, 2015, were included. If multiple doses of metolazone were administered, the last dose given before the chlorothiazide index dose was considered the index dose; the metolazone index dose had to have been administered more than 2 hours before the chlorothiazide index dose. Data for a total of 90 diuretic doses (45 metolazone, 45 chlorothiazide) were included in the analysis. The median dose of loop diuretic in intravenous furosemide equivalents given over the 24- hour period before the metolazone index dose was 400 mg. The average length of stay was 34.7 days, and in-hospital mortality was 35.6% (16/45 patients). The primary end point of a net-negative urine output of 500 ml or greater during the 12 hours after the index dose occurred in 42.2% (19/45 patients) and 35.5% (16/45 patients) for the chlorothiazide and metolazone doses, respectively (p=0.581). The median 12- hour urine output following administration of metolazone was 810 ml (interquartile range [IQR] 866 ml) versus 1075 ml (IQR 940 ml) following administration of chlorothiazide (p=0.363). Compared with metolazone, the chlorothiazide doses did not result in an increase in urine output of at least 500 ml during the 12 hours following the dose relative to the 12 hours before the dose (31.1% vs 22.2%, p=0.754). No significant difference in achievement of net-negative urine output of 500 ml or greater during the 12 hours following the chlorothiazide or metolazone dose was noted (42.2% for chlorothiazide vs 35.5% for metolazone, p=0.581). The addition of intravenous chlorothiazide did not result in improved diuresis in patients with ADHF determined to be refractory to loop diuretic s and adjunctive oral metolazone.",
  "27838489": "Hypoxia / reoxygenation -induced HMGB1 translocation and release promotes islet proinflammatory cytokine production and early islet graft failure through TLRs signaling High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) translocation and release, which is involved in several tissue types of ischemia-reperfusion injuries, activate innate immunity by inducing proinflammatory cytokine production through its interaction with toll-like receptors (TLRs). Our objective was to determine the role of HMGB1 and the degree of activation of TLR -related signal transduction pathways in hypoxia / reoxygenation (H / R)-induced proinflammatory cytokine production and intra-islet graft inflammation. After islets are exposed to hypoxia - reoxygenation for 24h, TLR2 / 4 expression and TLR -mediated signaling was up-regulated in islets, and HMGB1 was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and released to the extracellular space. With H / R exposure, proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-1β and TNF-α) and islet injury were significantly increased, and these effects depend on TLR2 / 4 signaling pathways. Exogenous HMGB1 also induces islet inflammation and increases the phosphorylation of STAT3, p38 and IκBα in wild-type islets. TLR2 deficiency in TLR2 - KO islets resulted in the inhibition of IL-1β production and STAT3 / p38 phosphorylation after HMGB1 exposure. TLR4 deficiency in TLR4 - KO islets resulted in the inhibition of TNF-α production and IκBα phosphorylation after HMGB1 exposure. Pre-incubation of the STAT3, p38, or NF-κB inhibitors significantly inhibited HMGB1 -induced IL-1β or TNF-α production in islets, but the effect of HMGB1 or H / R -induced islet injury was not counteracted by a separate treatment of the STAT3 inhibitor, p38 inhibitor, or NF-κB inhibitors. HMGB1 inhibition by ethyl pyruvate or blockade by neutralizing antibodies significantly decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3, p38 and IκBα, the production of IL-1β and TNF-α, and the islet injury in wild-type islets after exposure to H / R and significantly improved early islet graft failure. Thus, our results suggest that HMGB1 released from H / R induced islets works in an autocrine manner to up-regulate STAT or p38 and augment IL-1β production via TLR2, and up-regulate NF-κB and augment TNF-α production via TLR4 in intra-islet, which are associated with H / R -induced islet injury and early graft failure.",

MRSA isolates from clinical specimens obtained by the main New Zealand veterinary diagnostic laboratories between June 2012 and June 2013, were genotypically characterised by DNA microarray hybridisation analysis and spa typing. In addition, nasal or perineal skin swabs collected from a cross-sectional sample of dogs (n=361) and cats (n=225) attending 29 veterinary clinics in Auckland during the same period were analysed for MRSA by culture. Eight MRSA clinical isolates were submitted for characterisation by the participating laboratories. The isolates originated from five dogs, including two isolates from the same dog, one foal, and one isolate had no identification of the source. The strain - types identified were AK3 (ST-5 SCCmecIV t045; n=1), USA500 (ST8 SCCmecIV t064; n=1), WSPP (ST30 SCCmecIV t019; n=1), Rhine Hesse (ST5 SCCmecII t002; n=2), and EMRSA-15 (ST22 SCCmecIV t032; n=3). No MRSA were isolated from 586 cultured swabs. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were detected in 9/257 (3.5%) swabs and non-aureus staphylococci in 22/257 (8.5%) swabs. The estimated true MRSA subclinical colonisation prevalence was 0%, with an upper 95% CI boundary of 1.9% for cats and 1.4% for dogs. The modest number of MRSA isolates submitted for this study by the participating laboratories suggests clinical MRSA infection in animals in New Zealand continues to be sporadic. The wide variety of strain - types found mirrored the evolving strain - type diversity observed in humans. We cannot rule out bias due to the non-random sampling of dogs and cats, but the apparent colonisation prevalence of 0% was consistent with the low prevalence of subclinical colonisation in humans in New Zealand. These similarities indicate the epidemiology of animal and human MRSA infections are linked. In the last decade, the prevalence of human MRSA infections in New Zealand has steadily increased. This is the second published study of MRSA in animals in New Zealand. The results indicate clinical MRSA infection in animals remains sporadic, but the diversification of the strain - types may pose new therapeutic challenges to veterinarians, due to their diverse resistome.",

There is ample support for the use of technology-based self-screening to support health care delivery. We developed the VA eScreening program for veterans to directly provide self-report mental and physical health information through a veteran-facing portal that communicates with the electronic medical records system. A total of 1,372 newly enrolling veterans in 2 cohorts participated in a study to assess veteran satisfaction, determine accessibility and clinical processes, measure screening differences, and examine connection to care between eScreening and paper screening. Veterans who completed eScreening were slightly more satisfied with screening than those who completed paper screening. Accessibility, rate of screening completion, and clinical processes were significantly better with eScreening than paper screening. Except for higher alcohol use in the paper-based cohort, veterans who completed paper and eScreening were similar in the rates of positive health screens. Connection to VA services, rate and speed of vesting in the health care system, and time to document required suicide risk assessments were better with the VA eScreening program than paper screening. The VA eScreening program is a unique and promising tool that may leverage limited resources to improve screening and care for veterans. (PsycINFO Database Record",

  "28368473": "Targeting MYC as a therapeutic intervention for anaplastic thyroid cancer Recent studies showed that transcription of the MYC gene is driven by interaction of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins with acetylated histones on chromatin. A potent inhibitor, JQ1, which effectively disrupts the interaction of BET proteins with acetylated histones, preferentially suppresses transcription of the MYC gene. We recently reported that JQ1 decreased thyroid tumor growth and improved survival in a mouse model of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) by targeting MYC transcription. It remains to be elucidated on the role of MYC in human ATC and whether JQ1 could effectively target MYC as a novel treatment modality. To understand underlying molecular mechanisms of JQ1's effects on human ATC, we evaluated the efficacy of JQ1 in human ATC cell lines and xenograft models. We determined the effects of JQ1 on proliferation and invasion in cell lines and xenograft tumors. We identified key regulators critical for JQ1 -affected proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. JQ1 markedly inhibited proliferation of 4 ATC cell lines by suppression of MYC and elevation of p21and p27 to decrease phosphorylated Rb to delay cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase. JQ1 blocked cell invasion by attenuating epithelial mesenchymal transition signals. These cell-based studies were further confirmed in xenograft studies in that the size and rate of tumor growth was inhibited by JQ1 via inhibition of p21-Cyclin/CDK-Rb-E2F signaling. These results suggest targeting MYC protein could be a potential novel treatment modality for human ATC for which effective treatment options are limited.",
  "27334470": "Genomic analysis of nontypeable pneumococci causing invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa, 2003-2013 The capsular polysaccharide is the principal virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae and a target for current pneumococcal vaccines. However, some pathogenic pneumococci are serologically nontypeable [nontypeable pneumococci (NTPn)]. Due to their relative rarity, NTPn are poorly characterized, and, as such, limited data exist which describe these organisms. We aimed to describe disease and genotypically characterize NTPn causing invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa. Isolates were detected through national, laboratory - based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa and characterized by whole genome analysis. We predicted ancestral serotypes (serotypes from which NTPn may have originated) for Group I NTPn using multilocus sequence typing and capsular region sequence analyses. Antimicrobial resistance patterns and mutations potentially causing nontypeability were identified. From 2003-2013, 39 (0.1 %, 39/32,824) NTPn were reported. Twenty-two (56 %) had partial capsular genes (Group I) and 17 (44 %) had complete capsular deletion of which 15 had replacement by other genes (Group II). Seventy-nine percent (31/39) of our NTPn isolates were derived from encapsulated S. pneumoniae. Ancestral serotypes 1 (27 %, 6/22) and 8 (14 %, 3/22) were most prevalent, and 59 % (13/22) of ancestral serotypes were serotypes included in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. We identified a variety of mutations within the capsular region of Group I NTPn, some of which may be responsible for the nontypeable phenotype. Nonsusceptibility to tetracycline and erythromycin was higher in NTPn than encapsulated S. pneumoniae. NTPn are currently a rare cause of invasive pneumococcal disease in South Africa and represent a genetically diverse collection of isolates.",

They have been conventionally classified as deviations or violations, depending on their impact on the trial. A new method has been proposed by which deviations are classified in five grades from 1 to 5. A deviation of Grade 1 has no impact on the subjects' well-being or on the quality of data. At the maximum, a deviation Grade 5 leads to the death of the subject. This method of classification was applied to deviations noted in the center over the last 3 years. It was observed that most deviations were of Grades 1 and 2, with fewer falling in Grades 3 and 4. There were no deviations that led to the death of the subject (Grade 5). This method of classification would help trial managers decide on the action to be taken on the occurrence of deviations, which would be based on their impact.",

The pulsed dye lasers (PDLs) are an effective option for ETR, and the purpuragenic fluence proved to be superior until now. Given that purpura and subsequent possible postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) are occasionally unbearable in some patients, and several studies using the low nonpurpuragenic fluence were reported. To deliver the sufficient high fluence of a PDL without generating purpura, we designed the fractionation of high fluence using five passes and longer pulse duration (6 milliseconds) of a PDL in succession. A total of eight patients with ETR were enrolled in this study; all patients were treated with PDL 10 times at 2-week intervals. Erythema and telangiectasia scores, as well as improvement, were assessed by two physicians using the digital photographs. Moderate-to-marked improvement was achieved in most of the patients, and erythema and telangiectasia scores were significantly decreased. Purpura and PIH were not reported in all patients. The fractionation of high-fluence, long-pulsed 595 nm PDL is a very safe and effective treatment for ETR.",
  "27593936": "TFAP2C promotes lung tumorigenesis and aggressiveness through miR-183 - and miR-33a -mediated cell cycle regulation Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and thus new molecular targets need to be identified to improve treatment efficacy. Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ KRAS mutation -driven lung tumorigenesis is well understood, the mechanism of EGFR / KRAS -independent signal activation remains elusive. Enhanced TFAP2C (transcription factor activating enhancer-binding protein 2C) expression is associated with poor prognosis in some types of cancer patients, but little is known of its relation with the pathogenesis of lung cancer. In the present study, we found that TFAP2C overexpression was associated with cell cycle activation and NSCLC cell tumorigenesis. Interestingly, TFAP2C blocked AKAP12 -mediated cyclin D1 inhibition by inducing the overexpression of oncogenic microRNA (miRNA)-183 and simultaneously activated cyclin-dependent kinase 6 -mediated cell cycle progression by downregulating tumor-suppressive miRNA-33a. In a mouse xenograft model, TFAP2C promoted lung tumorigenesis and disease aggressiveness via the miR-183 and miR-33a pathways. The study provides a mechanism of mitogenic and oncogenic signaling via two functionally opposed miRNAs and suggests that TFAP2C -induced cell cycle hyperactivation contributes to lung tumorigenesis.",
  "27732647": "Are Eyes a Mirror of the Soul? What Eye Wrinkles Reveal about a Horse's Emotional State Finding valid indicators of emotional states is one of the biggest challenges in animal welfare science. Here, we investigated in horses whether variation in the expression of eye wrinkles caused by contraction of the inner eyebrow raiser reflects emotional valence. By confronting horses with positive and negative conditions, we aimed to induce positive and negative emotional states, hypothesising that positive emotions would reduce whereas negative emotions would increase eye wrinkle expression. Sixteen horses were individually exposed in a balanced order to two positive (grooming, food anticipation) and two negative condition s (food competition, waving a plastic bag). Each condition lasted for 60 seconds and was preceded by a 60 second control phase. Throughout both phases, pictures of the eyes were taken, and for each horse four pictures per condition and phase were randomly selected. Pictures were scored in random order and by two experimenters blind to condition and phase for six outcome measures: qualitative impression, eyelid shape, markedness of the wrinkles, presence of eye white, number of wrinkles, and the angle between the line through the eyeball and the highest wrinkle. The angle decreased during grooming and increased during food competition compared to control phase s, whereas the two phases did not differ during food anticipation and the plastic bag condition. No effects on the other outcome measures were detected. Taken together, we have defined a set of measures to assess eye wrinkle expression reliably, of which one measure was affected by the conditions the horses were exposed to. Variation in eye wrinkle expression might provide valuable information on horse welfare but further validation of specific measures across different conditions is needed.",

This study examined whether high work stress increased the risk of T2DM risk in later life, accounting also for other sources of stress outside work, such as burden from household chores. From the population -based prospective study SNAC-K, 2719 diabetes-free participants aged ≥60 years were identified and followed up for 6 years. T2DM was ascertained by glycated haemoglobin level, self-report, hypoglycaemic medication use and clinical records. Levels of job control and demands over the whole working life were assessed by a validated matrix. Household chores load was assessed by hours spent on such chores. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between job strain and T2DM. During the 6- year follow-up, 154 incident cases of T2DM were identified. High job strain was associated with T2DM occurrence amongst the 60- year - old cohort (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.27-7.77), and only amongst women (OR = 6.18, 95% CI: 1.22-31.26), but not in men. When taking into account household chores load, a more pronounced risk of T2DM was associated with high job strain in combination with heavy household chores load in women aged 60 years at baseline (OR = 9.45, 95% CI: 1.17-76.53). Work-related psychosocial stress may increase the risk of T2DM only amongst women in their early 60s. The risk can be amplified by high household chores load.",
  "28249118": "Antenatal Determinants of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia and Late Respiratory Disease in Preterm Infants Rationale/Objectives: To identify antenatal risk factors associated with increased risk for BPD and respiratory disease during early childhood after preterm birth, we performed a prospective, longitudinal study of 587 preterm infants with gestational age <34 weeks and birth weights between 500-1250 grams. Data included perinatal information and assessments during the NICU admission and longitudinal follow-up by questionnaire until 2 years of age. After adjusting for covariates, maternal smoking prior to preterm birth increased the odds of having an infant with BPD by 2-fold(p=0.02). Maternal smoking was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and respiratory support during the NICU admission. Pre-existing hypertension was associated with a 2-fold(p=0.04) increase in odds for BPD. Lower gestational age and birth weight z-scores were associated with BPD. Preterm infants who were exposed to maternal smoking had higher rates of late respiratory disease during childhood. 22% of infants diagnosed with BPD and 34% of preterm infants without BPD had no clinical signs of late respiratory disease during early childhood. We conclude that maternal smoking and hypertension increase the odds for developing BPD after preterm birth, and that maternal smoking is strongly associated with increased odds for late respiratory morbidities during early childhood. These findings suggest that in addition to the BPD diagnosis at 36 weeks, other factors modulate late respiratory outcomes during childhood. We speculate that measures to reduce maternal smoking will not only lower the risk for preterm birth but also will improve late respiratory morbidities after preterm birth.",

School-aged children with ASD (n = 28) and age-matched typically developing controls (n = 22; 7-13 years) performed a sequential match-to-sample between a solid shape (sample) and two illusory alternatives. We tracked eye gaze and behavioral performance in two task conditions: one with and one without local interference from background noise elements. While analyses revealed lower accuracy and longer reaction time in ASD in the condition with local interference only, eye tracking robustly captured ASD -related global atypicalities across both conditions. Specifically, relative to controls, children with ASD showed decreased fixations to KIC centers, indicating reduced global perception. Notably, they did not differ from controls in regard to fixations to local elements or touch response location. These results indicate impaired global perception in the absence of heightened local processing in ASD. They also underscore the utility of eye-tracking measures as objective indices of global / local visual processing strategies in ASD.

  "28545217": "A miniature bird -borne passive air sampler for monitoring halogenated flame retardants Birds have been used intensively as biomonitors of halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), and several studies have reported elevated tissue concentrations and inter- individual variability for these contaminants. While diet is known to be an important exposure pathway for HFRs in birds, it has been suggested that exposure through air may represent an underestimated source of HFRs for certain species. However, a method was not available for measuring the atmospheric exposure of individual birds to HFRs or other semi-volatile contaminants. The goal of this study was to develop a bird -borne passive air sampler (PAS) enabling the determination of individual atmospheric exposure to gas - and particle-phase HFRs using the ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) nesting in the Montreal area (QC, Canada). The new miniaturized elliptical-shaped PAS (mean weight: 2.72g) was tested using two sorbent types during three exposure periods (one, two and three weeks). Results showed that PAS using polyurethane foam (PUF) combined with a glass fiber filter collected all major polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and exhibited better performance for collecting highly hydrophobic DecaBDE mixture congeners compared to the PAS using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Emerging HFRs including hexabromobenzene, Dechlorane 604 Component B, and Dechlorane plus (DP) isomers also were sampled by the PUF -based PAS. Sampling rates for most HFRs were comparable between the three exposure periods. This novel bird -borne PAS provides valuable information on the non-dietary exposure of free-ranging birds to HFRs.",

However, studies relating changes in attentional load and task experience on a finer scale to pupil size modulations are scarce. Here, we investigated how these changes affect pupil sizes. To manipulate attentional load, participants covertly tracked between zero and five objects among several randomly moving objects on a computer screen. To investigate effects of task experience, the experiment was conducted on three consecutive days. We found that pupil sizes increased with each increment in attentional load. Across days, we found systematic pupil size reductions. We compared the model fit for predicting pupil size modulations using attentional load, task experience, and task performance as predictors. We found that a model which included attentional load and task experience as predictors had the best model fit while adding performance as a predictor to this model reduced the overall model fit. Overall, results suggest that pupillometry provides a viable metric for precisely assessing attentional load and task experience in visuospatial tasks.",

However, the level of radiation delivered by dynamic sequential scan protocol can be potentially high. The purpose of this work is to develop a pre-contrast normal-dose scan induced structure tensor total variation regularization based on the penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) criteria to improve the image quality of DMP-CT with a low-mAs CT acquisition. For simplicity, the present approach was termed as ' PWLS-ndiSTV '. Specifically, the ndiSTV regularization takes into account the spatial-temporal structure information of DMP-CT data and further exploits the higher order derivatives of the objective images to enhance denoising performance. Subsequently, an effective optimization algorithm based on the split-Bregman approach was adopted to minimize the associative objective function. Evaluations with modified dynamic XCAT phantom and preclinical porcine datasets have demonstrated that the proposed PWLS-ndiSTV approach can achieve promising gains over other existing approaches in terms of noise-induced artifacts mitigation, edge details preservation, and accurate MPHP maps calculation.",
  "28386881": "Object substitution masking and its relationship with visual crowding Object substitution masking (OSM) occurs when the perceptibility of a brief target is reduced by a trailing surround mask typically composed of four dots. Camp et al. (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 41, 940-957, 2015) found that crowding a target by adding adjacent flankers, in addition to OSM, had a more deleterious effect on performance than expected based on the combined individual effects of crowding and masking alone. The current experiments test why OSM and crowding interact in this way. In three experiments, target -flanker distance is manipulated whilst also varying mask duration in a digit identification task. The OSM effect-as indexed by the performance difference between unmasked and masked conditions -had a quadratic function with respect to target -flanker distance. Results suggest it is OSM affecting crowding rather than the converse: Masking seems to amplify crowding at intermediate target -distractor distances at the edge of the crowding interference zone. These results indicate that OSM and crowding share common mechanisms. The effect of OSM is possibly a consequence of changes to the types of feature detectors which are pooled together for target identification when that target must compete for processing with a trailing mask in addition to competition from adjacent flankers.",

The aim of this multicenter phase II study was to assess effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of protracted dual NK1-receptor and 5-HT3 antagonist prophylaxis against UA-RINV. Patients receiving fractionated radiotherapy with radiosensitizing chemotherapy received oral ondansetron 8 mg po q12 h and aprepitant 125/80/80 mg on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedules throughout radiotherapy. The primary outcome was complete response (CR) defined as no vomiting or rescue therapy during the entire observation period of radiotherapy (OP). Nausea, vomiting, and use of rescue medication were recorded in a modified version of the MASCC antiemesis tool completed twice weekly. Fifty-five patients were enrolled at 5 sites, 52 of whom were evaluable. 57.7% of patients (30/52, 95% CI 43.2-71.3%) achieved CR on study, with 73.1% (38/52, 95% CI 59.0-84.4%) who did not vomit, and 71.2% (37/52, 95% CI 56.9-82.9%) who did not use rescue medication during the OP. Overall, participants vomited or experienced significant nausea (SN) for an average of 6.8% (95% CI 11.4-21.0) and 8.4% (95% CI 4.2-12.7%) of time on study, respectively. Nausea was common with 32 (61.5%) reporting SN at any time during the OP. UA-RINV remains an important morbidity despite the advent of modern radiotherapy.

  "28043566": "Interferon-γ assay, a high-sensitivity, specific and appropriate method for detection of bovine tuberculosis in cattle Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an important zoonotic disease that is caused by Mycobacterium bovis. Eradication efforts in developed countries have reduced the prevalence of this disease significantly. TB can be difficult to diagnose based only on the clinical signs; therefore, it is usually diagnosed in the field with the tuberculin skin test and diagnostic blood tests, including the lymphocyte proliferation assay, the interferon (IFN)-γ assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The aim of this study was to compare the tuberculin and IFN-γ tests. A total of 110 animals were evaluated by tuberculin skin test (TST) and IFN-γ assay; the culture was selected as a gold standard. The animals were selected randomly from 700 cattle on dairy farms, aged 3-5 years and suspected of having TB. Ten cattle were positive using the TST and nine were positive by IFN-γ assay. All nine positive samples in the IFN-γ assay were positive in culture too. The observed errors in IFN-γ assay were less due to laboratorial tools. It is suggested that all positive samples in TST are also positive by IFN-γ too.",

The cross-sectional study involved 100 participants who were residents of a nursing home and aged older than 65 years. Fear of falling was assessed using the Falls Efficacy Scale. Functional status was assessed by four performance-based measures. Balance was assessed by the Berg Balance Scale, mobility by the Timed Up and Go test, lower limbs muscle strength by the Chair Rising Test and participants' functional ability by the motor Functional Independence Measure. There was a significant negative correlation between the Falls Efficacy Scale and Berg Balance Scale (P < 0.001), and motor Functional Independence Measure (P < 0.001) scores; and a positive correlation with the Timed Up and Go test (P < 0.001) and Chair Rising Test (P < 0.001) values. Falls Efficacy Scale score increase is associated with age, being a widower / widow and the number of falls in the previous year. Higher fear of falling is associated with an increase in the number of falls in the previous year and with a decrease in Berg Balance Scale score. The study found a significant associations between Falls Efficacy Scale score and all of the examined parameters of functional status, the number of falls in the previous year, age and marital status of widower / widow. The major finding was that poor balance and an increase in the number of falls in the previous year are independent factors significantly associated with the fear of falling.

  "28418900": "Therapeutic inhibition of USP7 - PTEN network in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a strategy to overcome TP53 mutated / deleted clones Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disorder with either indolent or aggressive clinical course. Current treatment regiments have significantly improved the overall outcomes even if higher risk subgroups - those harboring TP53 mutations or deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p) - remain highly challenging. In the present work, we identified USP7, a known de-ubiquitinase with multiple roles in cellular homeostasis, as a potential therapeutic target in CLL. We demonstrated that in primary CLL samples and in CLL cell lines USP7 is: i) over-expressed through a mechanism involving miR-338-3p and miR-181b deregulation; ii) functionally activated by Casein Kinase 2 (CK2), an upstream interactor known to be deregulated in CLL; iii) effectively targeted by the USP7 inhibitor P5091. Treatment of primary CLL samples and cell lines with P5091 induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis, through the restoration of PTEN nuclear pool, both in TP53 - wild type and - null environment. Importantly, PTEN acts as the main tumor suppressive mediator along the USP7 - PTEN axis in a p53 dispensable manner. In conclusion, we propose USP7 as a new druggable target in CLL.",

CS / PHEMA microgels were prepared by emulsifier-free emulsion polymerisation with N,N '-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) as a crosslinker. The study on drug loading, using salicylic acid (SA) as a model drug, was performed. The results showed that the encapsulation efficiency (EE) increased as drug -to- microgel ratio was increased. Higher EE can be achieved with the increase in degree of crosslinking, by increasing the amount of MBA from 0.01 g to 0.03 g. In addition, the highest EE (61.1%) was observed at pH 3. The highest release of SA (60%) was noticed at pH 2.4, while the lowest one (49.4%) was obtained at pH 7.4. Moreover, the highest release of SA was enhanced by the presence of 0.2 M NaCl. The pH - and ionic-sensitivity of CS / PHEMA could be useful as a sustained release delivery device, especially for oral delivery.",

Here we report 55 patients with HIS who were diagnosed at our institution during the past 5 years. Seven patients presented with symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea, while the others were incidentally diagnosed during screening colonoscopy. Most patients had non-specific endoscopic findings, including intestinal edema or erosion. The diagnosis of HIS was histologically confirmed via hematoxylin and eosin staining, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and/or immunohistochemistry using anti-Treponema pallidum antibody. Among the 55 patients, five were diagnosed with diseases other than HIS (amoebic colitis, three; ulcerative colitis, one). Sixteen patients were treated with either amoxicillin or metronidazole ;only metronidazole proved to be effective. The clinical significance of asymptomatic HIS remains unknown. Some case reports suggest a risk for increased severity in patients with immunodeficiency and/or sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, aggressive treatment for HIS should be considered, particularly in high-risk patients.",

Eight rats were exposed to smoke for 60 min/d for 4 weeks, and eight rats were not exposed to smoke and served as controls. The experimental group was maintained in a plexiglass cabin during exposure to smoke. At the end of 4 weeks, rats were sacrificed under high-dose ketamine anesthesia. Each vocal fold was removed. An expert pathologist blinded to the experimental group evaluated the tissues for the following: epithelial distribution, inflammation, hyperplasia, and metaplasia. Mucosal cellular activities were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for Ki67. Results taken before and after effect were compared statistically. There was a significant difference in the extent of inflammation between the experimental group and the control group. Squamous metaplasia was detected in each group, but the difference was not significant. None of the larynges in either group developed hyperplasia.

Data from 304 patients undergoing OLT between 1996 and 2010 were used to assess the association of mean serum uric acid (UA) level in the 3- months post-OLT with mortality, doubling of creatinine, and ESRD incidence. Post-OLT survival to event outcomes according to UA level and eGFR was assessed using the Kaplan Meier method and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Mean UA level among the 204 patients with an eGFR level ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) was 6.4 mg/dl compared to 7.9 mg/dl among the 100 patients with eGFR <60 (p < 0.0001). During a median of 4.6 years of follow-up, mortality rate, doubling of creatinine, and ESRD incidence were 48.9, 278.2, and 20.7 per 1000 person - years, respectively. In the first 5 years of follow-up, elevated UA was associated with mortality (Hazard Ratio, HR = 1.7; p = 0.045). However, among those with eGFR ≥ 60, UA level did not predict mortality (HR = 1.0; p = 0.95), and among those with eGFR < 60, elevated UA was a strong predictor of mortality (HR = 3.7[1.1, 12.0]; p = 0.03). UA was not associated with ESRD, but was associated with doubling of creatinine among diabetics (HR = 2.2[1.1, 4.3]; p = 0.025).

Clinical / laboratorial data and treatment were also assessed in JIA. The median current age was similar between JIA patients and controls [15(10-19) vs. 15(12-18) years, p=0.506]. Frequencies of alcohol / tobacco / illicit drug use were high and similar in both JIA and controls (43% vs. 46%, p=0.829). However, age at alcohol onset was significantly higher in those with JIA [15(11-18) vs. 14(7-18) years, p=0.032], particularly in polyarticular onset (p=0.040). High risk for substance abuse / dependence (CRAFFT score ≥2) was found in both groups (13% vs. 15%, p=1.000), likewise bullying (p=0.088).

The aim of this study was to measure TGF-β concentration in serum samples and in PHA - stimulated whole blood culture in vitro and to analyze possible associations of TGF-β1 levels with leukocyte, lymphocyte and platelets counts, the histological type of thyroid cancer, and stage of disease. TGF-β1 was measured in 22 DTC patients and 20 healthy controls using the duoSet ELISA Development kit for human TGF-β1. The concentration of TGF-β1 in serum samples from both groups correlated positively with the platelet counts. There was no statistically significant difference in the serum concentrations of TGF-β1 between DTC patients and control subjects, but PHA stimulated whole blood cultures of DTC patients produced less TGF-β1 than those from controls.

The study comprised 79 T. equigenitalis field isolates originating from ten defined breeds of German horses and revealed a spectrum of five REP (rep-E1-E4, rep-E3a) and 15 PFGE (TE-A1-A9, TE-B1-B3, TE-C, TE-E1, and TE-E2) genotypes. T. equigenitalis field isolates (n=40) obtained from Austrian Lipizzaner horses were differentiated into three REP (rep-E1, rep-E3a, and rep-E4) and three PFGE genotypes (TE-A2, TE-A5, and TE-D); those isolated from four Austrian Trotters belonged to the REP / PFGE genotype rep-E2/TE-A1. Interestingly, a T. equigenitalis isolate recovered from a Holsteiner stallion living in South Africa revealed the REP / PFGE genotype rep-E1/TE-A5 which was otherwise exclusively present in the majority of Austrian Lipizzaner horses in our study. The type strain included in this study revealed the genotype REP / PFGE rep-E1/TE-F. Six strains of T. asinigenitalis including the type strain were separated into three REP (rep-A1-A3) and six PFGE genotypes (TA-A1, TA-A2, TA-A3, TA-B, TA-C, TA-D). Overall, the generated REP and PFGE genotypes showed a good correlation, whereas REP-PCR proved to be a suitable method for molecular epidemiological screening of T. equigenitalis and T. asinigenitalis isolates that should be differentiated in detail by genotyping using PFGE.",
  "28214898": "Early Development of Parvalbumin -, Somatostatin -, and Cholecystokinin -Expressing Neurons in Rat Brain following Prenatal Immune Activation and Maternal Iron Deficiency Prenatal maternal infection and maternal iron deficiency during pregnancy are 2 early environmental insults associated with increased risk for schizophrenia in offspring. Substantial evidence suggests that abnormalities in inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneuron function, especially in the parvalbumin subtype of GABA interneuron, both developmentally and in adulthood, may contribute mechanistically to cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. This study used a rat model to test whether prenatal immune activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; at gestation days, GD, 15 and 16) or maternal iron deficiency (from GD 2 to postnatal day P7) or the combination of both insults alters major subtypes of GABAergic interneurons (parvalbumin, somatostatin, cholecystokinin) in brain regions relevant to schizophrenia (medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [PFC], hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus, ventral subiculum) in offspring at P14 or P28. Prenatal LPS treatment significantly increased the density of parvalbumin - immunoreactive neurons at P14 in the medial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and ventral subiculum of offspring born from iron-sufficient but not iron-deficient dams. Prenatal LPS also increased cholecystokinin neuron density in the medial PFC at P28, under both iron-sufficient and iron-deficient conditions. We observed a large increase in parvalbumin neuron density from P14 to P28 in the medial PFC and subiculum across all birth groups, that was not observed in other brain regions, and significant decreases in somatostatin neuron density from P14 to P28 in all brain regions examined across all birth groups, indicating differential developmental trajectories for parvalbumin and somatostatin neurons in various brain regions during this early postnatal period. Thus, it appears that the medial PFC and ventral subiculum, brain regions involved in circuitry modulating ventral tegmental dopamine and nucleus accumbens activities, may be regions vulnerable to effects of prenatal LPS on specific subpopulations of interneurons. It is known that the timing of maturation and expansion of parvalbumin neurons in early development provides threshold levels of inhibition that trigger critical periods for cortical plasticity, leading to long-term circuit consolidation. Thus, our finding of increased parvalbumin neuron density at early developmental times might suggest a mechanism by which an acute prenatal insult like LPS exposure could produce long-term changes in prefrontal cortical or subicular function.",
  "27638176": "A Characeae Cells Plasma Membrane as a Model for Selection of Bioactive Compounds and Drugs: Interaction of HAMLET-Like Complexes with Ion Channels of Chara corallina Cells Plasmalemma Interaction of a HAMLET-like La-OA cytotoxic complex (human α-lactalbumin - oleic acid) and its constituents with the excitable plasmalemma of giant Chara corallina cells was investigated. The voltage-clamp technique was used to study Ca(2+) and Cl(-) transient currents in the plasmalemma of intact cells. The action of the complex and OA on the target cell membrane has a dose-dependent character. It was found that the La-OA complex has an inhibiting effect on Ca(2+) current across the plasmalemma, while α-lactalbumin alone does not affect the electrophysiological characteristics of the cellular membrane. However, oleic acid blocks Ca(2+) current across the plasmalemma. This is accompanied by the induction of a non-selective conductivity in the cellular membrane, a decrease in the resting potential and plasma membrane resistance of algal cells. We propose that the cytotoxicity of La-OA and other HAMLET-like complexes is determined by oleic acid acting as a blocker of potential -dependent Ca(2+) channels in the plasma membrane of target cells. The presented results show that the study model of green algae C. corallina cells plasmalemma is a convenient tool for the investigation of ion channels in many animal cells.",
  "28376393": "A novel assay to measure tertiary and quaternary amines in wastewater: An indicator for NDMA wastewater precursors This study examined the potential of using a novel bulk amine assay as an approximation for the tertiary and quaternary amine load in wastewaters and surface water samples, and this approximation was compared to N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential using chloramines. An existing colorimetric method was examined and optimized for the detection of amines in environmental water samples. The method consists of liquid-liquid extraction followed by a catalyzed reaction to form a yet- undefined product that is known to be both a strong chromophore and fluorophore. Previous work verified that this reaction was effectively catalyzed by a number of compounds containing tertiary and quaternary amine moieties. Many tertiary and quaternary compounds are also efficient producers of NDMA under chloramination conditions, and a linear correlation was consequently derived from the bulk amine signals vs. NDMA formation potential in various wastewater samples (R(2) = 0.74; n = 24; p-value < 0.05). The results provide evidence that approximately 2% of the tertiary and quaternary amines measured can form NDMA and an estimated 0.01-1.3% of nitrogen in dissolved organic nitrogen originates from these bulk amines. The normalization of NDMA concentration by the amine measurement revealed that ozone effectively destroyed those tertiary and quaternary amine structures more likely to form NDMA in treated wastewater samples. This bulk amine assay illustrates that proxy measurements of tertiary and quaternary amines can be linked to the NDMA formation potential of a given sample, and this approach may prove useful as a characterizing tool for NDMA precursors in wastewater.",

In a recent report of bipolar RFA, using two expandable needle electrodes, was uneventfully performed in patients with large GCH (>10 cm). The objective of this report is to present two cases in which bipolar RFA of symptomatic GCH was complicated by acute kidney injury. In 2015 we treated two patients for very large symptomatic GCH (15.7 and 25.0 cm) with bipolar RFA during open laparotomy. In both patients the urine showed a red-brown discoloration directly after the ablation. They became anuric and presented with progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia, requiring hemodialysis for a period of 1 month in one case. Lab results revealed hemepigment - induced acute kidney. Both patients fully recovered and both showed a complete relief of symptoms at 3 months following the procedure. RFA for large GCHs can cause hemepigment - induced acute kidney injury due to massive intravascular hemolysis. The presented cases suggest that caution is warranted and advocate an upper limit regarding the volume of GCHs that can be safely ablated.",

To estimate the added effect of surgical fusion as compared to decompression surgery alone in symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis patients with spondylolisthesis. The optimal surgical management of lumbar spinal stenosis patients with spondylolisthesis remains controversial. Patients of the LSOS with confirmed DLSS and spondylolisthesis were enrolled in this study. The outcomes of this study were Spinal Stenosis Measure (SSM) symptoms (score range 1-5, best-worst) and function (1-4) over time, measured at baseline, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up. In order to quantify the effect of fusion surgery as compared to decompression alone and number of decompressed levels, we used mixed effects models and accounted for the repeated observations in main outcomes (SSM symptoms and SSM function) over time. In addition to individual patients ' random effects, we also fitted random slopes for follow-up time points and compared these two approaches with Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and the chi-squared test. Confounders were adjusted with fixed effects for age, gender, BMI, diabetes, CIRS musculoskeletal disorders and duration of symptoms. One hundred and thirty-one patients undergoing decompression surgery alone (n = 85) or decompression plus fusion surgery (n = 46) were included in this study. In the multiple mixed effects model the adjusted effect of fusion versus decompression alone surgery on SSM symptoms was 0.06 (95% confidence interval, CI: -0.16 to 0.27) and -0.07 (95% CI: -0.25 to 0.10) on SSM function, respectively. Among the patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis our study confirms that in the two groups, decompression alone and decompression plus fusion, patients distinctively benefited from surgical treatment. When adjusted for confounders, fusion surgery was not associated with a more favorable outcome in both SSM scores as compared to decompression alone surgery. 3.",
  "27860505": "Evolution of Inbreeding Avoidance and Inbreeding Preference through Mate Choice among Interacting Relatives While extensive population genetic theory predicts conditions favoring evolution of self-fertilization versus outcrossing, there is no analogous theory that predicts conditions favoring evolution of inbreeding avoidance or inbreeding preference enacted through mate choice given obligate biparental reproduction. Multiple interacting processes complicate the dynamics of alleles underlying such inbreeding strategies, including sexual conflict, distributions of kinship, genetic drift, purging of mutation load, direct costs, and restricted kin discrimination. We incorporated these processes into an individual-based model to predict conditions where selection should increase or decrease frequencies of alleles causing inbreeding avoidance or inbreeding preference when females or males controlled mating. Selection for inbreeding avoidance occurred given strong inbreeding depression when either sex chose mates, while selection for inbreeding preference occurred given very weak inbreeding depression when females chose but never occurred when males chose. Selection for both strategies was constrained by direct costs and restricted kin discrimination. Purging was negligible, but allele frequencies were strongly affected by drift in small populations, while selection for inbreeding avoidance was weak in larger populations because inbreeding risk decreased. Therefore, while selection sometimes favored alleles underlying inbreeding avoidance or preference, evolution of such strategies may be much more restricted and stochastic than is commonly presumed.",
  "28512014": "Expressional divergence of insect GOX genes: From specialist to generalist glucose oxidase Insect herbivores often secrete glucose oxidase (GOX) onto plants to counteract plant defenses and potential pathogens. Whether generalist herbivores always have significantly higher GOX activities than their specialist counterparts at any comparable stage or conditions and how this is realized remain unknown. To address these two general questions, we subjected larvae of a pair of sister species differed mainly in host range, the generalist Helicoverpa armigera and its specialist counterpart Helicoverpa assulta, to the same sets of stage, protein to digestible carbohydrate (P:C) ratio, allelochemical or host plant treatments for simultaneous analyses of GOX transcripts and activities in their labial glands. GOX activity and transcripts are upregulated concurrently with food ingestion and body growth, downregulated with stopping ingestion and wandering for pupation in both species. The three tested host plants upregulated GOX transcripts, and to a lesser extent, GOX activity in both species. There were significant differences in both GOX transcripts and activity elicited by allelochemicals, but only in GOX transcripts by P:C ratios in both species. GOX activities were higher in H. armigera than H. assulta in all the comparable treatments, but GOX transcripts were significantly higher either in generalists or in specialists, depending on the developmental stages, host plants, P:C ratio and allelochemicals they encounter. These data indicate that the greater GOX activity in generalist herbivores is not achieved by greater transcription rate, but by greater transcript stability, greater translation rate, better enzyme stability and/or their combination.",
  "27637575": "Macrophages modulate the growth and differentiation of rhesus monkey embryonic trophoblasts Immune cells within the endometrium at implantation are thought to play an important role in implantation, although their exact role is not well understood. A co-culture system of rhesus monkey embryos and maternal immune cells was established. Blastocysts obtained by in vitro fertilization were co-cultured with peripheral blood cells or decidual macrophages. Culture media were collected to assess secretions. Embryo growth was monitored, and trophoblasts were evaluated for proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Embryonic trophoblast outgrowths were visible within 6 days of culture, and the area of embryo outgrowth was reduced when blastocysts were cultured with peripheral - derived or decidual macrophages. Trophoblast proliferation was not significantly affected with macrophage co-culture while chorionic gonadotropin secretion was increased. Trophoblast expression of CDH 11 and GJA1 was increased, suggesting that macrophages accelerate differentiation of peri-implantation trophoblasts. These results indicate an important role of macrophages in placentation and pregnancy success.",
  "27508384": "Integration of Serum Protein Biomarker and Tumor Associated Autoantibody Expression Data Increases the Ability of a Blood-Based Proteomic Assay to Identify Breast Cancer Despite significant advances in breast imaging, the ability to accurately detect Breast Cancer (BC) remains a challenge. With the discovery of key biomarkers and protein signatures for BC, proteomic technologies are currently poised to serve as an ideal diagnostic adjunct to imaging. Research studies have shown that breast tumors are associated with systemic changes in levels of both serum protein biomarkers (SPB) and tumor associated autoantibodies (TAAb). However, the independent contribution of SPB and TAAb expression data for identifying BC relative to a combinatorial SPB and TAAb approach has not been fully investigated. This study evaluates these contributions using a retrospective cohort of pre - biopsy serum samples with known clinical outcomes collected from a single site, thus minimizing potential site-to-site variation and enabling direct assessment of SPB and TAAb contributions to identify BC. All serum samples (n = 210) were collected prior to biopsy. These specimens were obtained from 18 participants with no evidence of breast disease (ND), 92 participants diagnosed with Benign Breast Disease (BBD) and 100 participants diagnosed with BC, including DCIS. All BBD and BC diagnoses were based on pathology results from biopsy. Statistical models were developed to differentiate BC from non-BC (i.e., BBD and ND) using expression data from SPB alone, TAAb alone, and a combination of SPB and TAAb. When SPB data was independently used for modeling, clinical sensitivity and specificity for detection of BC were 74.7% and 77.0%, respectively. When TAAb data was independently used, clinical sensitivity and specificity for detection of BC were 72.2% and 70.8%, respectively. When modeling integrated data from both SPB and TAAb, the clinical sensitivity and specificity for detection of BC improved to 81.0% and 78.8%, respectively. These data demonstrate the benefit of the integration of SPB and TAAb data and strongly support the further development of combinatorial proteomic approaches for detecting BC.",
  "28442401": "TRIB3 downregulation enhances doxorubicin - induced cytotoxicity in gastric cancer cells TRIB3, which is a pseudokinase known to regulate multiple pro-survival pathways, appears to be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of human tumors. However, its precise role in cancer is controversial, as TRIB3 protein levels have been associated with both good and poor prognosis in cancer patients. Here, we investigated the significance of TRIB3 expression in the survival of gastric cancer cells exposed to anticancer drugs. We found that the tested anticancer drug, doxorubicin, induced cytotoxicity by decreasing TRIB3 transcription, which was followed by apoptotic cell death. Moreover, TRIB3 siRNA knockdown appeared to enhance doxorubicin - induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, concurrently with altering the expression of downstream apoptotic factors. Conversely, overexpression of TRIB3 significantly protected cells against doxorubicin - induced apoptosis. Our results indicate that downregulation of TRIB3 appears to promote cell death and enhance doxorubicin - induced apoptosis, supporting the anti-apoptotic role of TRIB3. The inductions of three classes of MAPKs failed to affect doxorubicin -mediated TRIB3 downregulation, while TRIB3 overexpression did not affect doxorubicin - induced MAPK activation. In sum, our findings indicate that TRIB3 plays an anti-apoptotic role in doxorubicin -treated gastric cancer cell lines, perhaps indicating that the status of TRIB3 expression in response to anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, irinotecan or oxaliplatin, may reflect the efficiency for cancer therapy.",
  "27545685": "Genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis of pesticide exposure and risk of Parkinson's disease Genetic factors and environmental exposures, including pesticides, contribute to the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). There have been few studies of gene and pesticide exposure interactions in PD, and all of the prior studies used a candidate gene approach. We performed the first genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis of pesticide exposure and risk of Parkinson's disease. Analyses were performed using data on >700,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 364 discordant sibling pairs. In addition to testing for SNP - pesticide interaction effects, we also performed exploratory analyses of gene- pesticide interactions at the gene level. None of the gene-environment interaction results were significant after genome-wide correction for multiple testing (α = 1.5E-07 for SNP - level tests; α = 2.1E-06 for gene - level tests). Top results in the SNP - level tests provided suggestive evidence (P < 5.0E-06) that the effect of pesticide exposure on PD risk may be modified by SNPs in the ERCC6L2 gene (P = 2.4E-06), which was also supported by suggestive evidence in the gene - level analysis (P = 4.7E-05). None of the candidate genes assessed in prior studies of gene - pesticide interactions reached statistical support in this genome-wide screen. Although no significant interactions were identified, several of the genes with suggestive evidence of gene-environment interaction effects have biological plausibility for PD risk. Further investigation of the role of those genes in PD risk, particularly in the context of pesticide exposure, in large and carefully recruited samples is warranted.",
  "27506608": "Adequacy of initial evaluation of fever in long-term care facilities Febrile residents in long-term care facilities (LTCF) might be inadequately evaluated by caregivers. The present study aimed to examine the factors associated with inadequacy of initial fever evaluations by caregivers at night in LTCF. We carried out a cross-sectional study among a convenience sample of caregivers employed at 11 LTCF in Japan using a vignette-based questionnaire. The respondents were randomly assigned to one of two scenarios describing a mild or severe febrile episode in an LTCF resident at night. The respondents ' thinking patterns were classified based on influential factors in their fever evaluation. Associations between adequacy of evaluation and respondents ' characteristics were evaluated using generalized linear mixed models. A total of 34% of fever evaluations among caregivers were considered to be inadequate regarding the necessity for examination by a physician, due in most cases to underestimating the severity of the fever. Respondents ' thinking patterns in fever evaluation were significantly associated with the adequacy of the evaluation. Caregivers who placed particular importance on the preferences of residents and families versus other factors including the resident 's febrile condition, were more likely to make an inadequate evaluation than those who did not. Our findings here suggest that eagerness to comply with residents ' preference in fever evaluation could prompt caregivers not to call for an appropriate diagnostic procedure.

The aim of this work was to develop an accurate and precise LC-MS / MS method for simultaneous quantification of all four first-line anti-TB drugs in plasma suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). To adjust for degradation and losses during sample preparation, isotopically labeled compounds were used as internal standards. Plasma samples spiked with internal standards were extracted using protein precipitation with methanol and acetonitrile. Simultaneous separation of all four drugs was accomplished with a Chromolith Reversed-Phase column and mobile phases consisting of water, methanol, ammonium acetate and formic acid with subsequent mass spectrometric quantification. The linear range of the calibration curve for isoniazid was 0.5-10 mg/L, for rifampicin 0.75-30 mg/L, for ethambutol 0.25-10 mg/L and for pyrazinamide 4-80 mg/L. The lower limit of quantification was 0.5 mg/L, 0.75 mg/L, 0.25 mg/L and 4.0 mg/L, respectively. Precision estimated by the coefficient of variation was <15% for all four drugs. The LC-MS / MS method can readily be used for simultaneous quantification of first-line anti-TB drugs in plasma and is well suited for TDM.",

Results showed larger knee power (knee extensor: K2) on the most affected leg in NW compared to NP (P=0.01). On the less affected side, larger power absorption (knee extensor: K3) was found during pre - swing (K3) compared to older adults in both NP and NW (P=0.01). NW showed longer stride length and single support time (P<0.01) compared to NP. Walking with poles improved gait spatial - temporal characteristics and power profile s at the knee joint both on the less and most affected sides in individuals with PD.

  "27699206": "Smooth versus Textured Surfaces: Feature -Based Category Selectivity in Human Visual Cortex In fMRI studies, human lateral occipital (LO) cortex is thought to respond selectively to images of objects, compared with nonobjects. However, it remains unresolved whether all objects evoke equivalent levels of activity in LO, and, if not, which image features produce stronger activation. Here, we used an unbiased parametric texture model to predict preferred versus nonpreferred stimuli in LO. Observation and psychophysical results showed that predicted preferred stimuli (both objects and nonobjects) had smooth (rather than textured) surfaces. These predictions were confirmed using fMRI, for objects and nonobjects. Similar preferences were also found in the fusiform face area (FFA). Consistent with this: (1) FFA and LO responded more strongly to nonfreckled (smooth) faces, compared with otherwise identical freckled (textured) faces; and (2) strong functional connections were found between LO and FFA. Thus, LO and FFA may be part of an information - processing stream distinguished by feature -based category selectivity (smooth > textured).",
  "27842269": "Using language for social interaction: Communication mechanisms promote recovery from chronic non-fluent aphasia Clinical research highlights the importance of massed practice in the rehabilitation of chronic post-stroke aphasia. However, while necessary, massed practice may not be sufficient for ensuring progress in speech-language therapy. Motivated by recent advances in neuroscience, it has been claimed that using language as a tool for communication and social interaction leads to synergistic effects in left perisylvian eloquent areas. Here, we conducted a crossover randomized controlled trial to determine the influence of communicative language function on the outcome of intensive aphasia therapy. Eighteen individuals with left-hemisphere lesions and chronic non-fluent aphasia each received two types of training in counterbalanced order: (i) Intensive Language-Action Therapy (ILAT, an extended form of Constraint-Induced Aphasia Therapy) embedding verbal utterances in the context of communication and social interaction, and (ii) Naming Therapy focusing on speech production per se. Both types of training were delivered with the same high intensity (3.5 h per session) and duration (six consecutive working days), with therapy materials and number of utterances matched between treatment groups. A standardized aphasia test battery revealed significantly improved language performance with ILAT, independent of when this method was administered. In contrast, Naming Therapy tended to benefit language performance only when given at the onset of the treatment, but not when applied after previous intensive training. The current results challenge the notion that massed practice alone promotes recovery from chronic post-stroke aphasia. Instead, our results demonstrate that using language for communication and social interaction increases the efficacy of intensive aphasia therapy.",

We included 37 adults who applied to our clinic for circumcision and who did not have any psychiatric or urologic disorders and age -matched 30 controls in our study. Body Cathexis Scale (BCS), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), and Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) were applied to the study group twice, once before and once three months after circumcision, and only once in the control group. Also, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was noted and premature ejaculation (PE) evaluation was done. Intra- and intergroup comparisons were performed. The two groups were similar with regard to demographic data. Comparison of preoperative BCS and LSAS scores with the scores of the control group showed significant differences (p=0.003, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively). However, postoperative scores were similar to the scores obtained in the control group (p=0.768, p>0.05, and p>0.05, respectively). Scores of all scales showed significant improvements postoperatively. Also, PEDT scores and IELT changes before and after circumcision were significant in the study group, but not when compared to the control group. Our results indicated that social anxiety and anxiety levels decreased after circumcision in adult Turkish men, and their body gratification increased. We found that not being circumcised might negatively affect individuals in adulthood when it comes to body image and sexual satisfaction, however, both improve after circumcision.",
  "27752744": "Incident fracture associated with increased risk of mortality even after adjusting for frailty status in elderly Japanese men: the Fujiwara-kyo Osteoporosis Risk in Men (FORMEN) Cohort Study Frail elderly individuals have elevated risks of both fracture and mortality. We found that incident fractures were associated with an increased risk of death even after adjusting for pre-fracture frailty status as represented by physical performance tests and laboratory tests for common geriatric diseases in community-dwelling elderly Japanese men. While fractures reportedly increase the risk of mortality, frailty may complicate this association, generating a false-positive result. We evaluated this association after adjusting for pre-fracture levels of frailty. We examined 1998 community-dwelling ambulatory men aged ≥65 years at baseline in the Fujiwara-kyo Osteoporosis Risk in Men Study for frailty status as represented by activities of daily living (ADL), physical performance tests (grip strength, one-foot standing balance with eyes open, timed 10-m walk), and laboratory sera tests. Participants were then followed for 5 years for incident clinical fractures and death. Effects of incident fracture on death were determined by Cox proportional hazards model with the first fracture during follow-up as a time-dependent predictor and with frailty status indices as covariates. We identified 111 fractures in 99 men and 138 deaths during the follow-up period (median follow-up, 4.5 years). Participants with incident fractures did not have significantly worse frailty statuses, but did show a significantly higher cumulative mortality rate than those without fractures (p = 0.0047). Age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of death for incident fracture was 3.57 (95 % confidence interval: 2.05, 6.24). When adjusted for physical performance, this decreased to 2.77 (1.51, 5.06), but remained significant. The HR showed no significant change when adjusted for laboratory test results (3.96 (2.26, 6.94)). Exclusion of deaths within the first 24 months of follow-up did not alter these results. Incident clinical fracture was associated with an elevated risk of death independently of pre-fracture levels of frailty in community-dwelling elderly men.",
  "27333594": "Proteomic analysis of docetaxel resistance in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells using the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method Docetaxel -based chemotherapy has been recommended for advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, treatment failure often occurs because of acquired drug resistance. In this study, a docetaxel - resistant NPC cell line CNE-2R was established with increasing doses of docetaxel for more than 6 months. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and ESI-Q-TOF-MS were used to compare the differential expression of docetaxel - resistance - associated proteins between human NPC CNE-2 cells and docetaxel - resistant CNE-2R cells. As a result, 24 differentially expressed proteins were identified, including 11 proteins with increased expression and 13 proteins with decreased expression. These proteins function in diverse biological processes such as metabolism, signal transduction, calcium ion binding, immune response, proteolysis, and so on. Among these, α-enolase (ENO1), significantly upregulated in CNE-2R, was selected for detailed analysis. Inhibition of ENO1 by shRNA restored CNE-2R cells ' sensitivity to docetaxel. Moreover, overexpression of ENO1 could facilitate the development of acquired resistance of docetaxel in CNE-2 cells. Western blot and reverse-transcription PCR data of clinical samples confirmed that α-enolase was upregulated in docetaxel - resistant human NPC tissues. Finding such proteins might improve interpretation of the molecular mechanisms leading to the acquisition of docetaxel chemoresistance.",

Diploid (DP) and triploid (TP) rice shows differences in morphological parameters, such as plant height, leaf length, leaf width and the physiological index of chlorophyll content. However, the underlying mechanisms determining these morphological differences are remain to be defined. To better understand the proteomic changes between DP and TP, tandem mass tags (TMT) mass spectrometry (MS) / MS was used to detect the significant changes to protein expression between DP and TP. Results indicated that both photosynthesis and metabolic pathways were highly significantly associated with proteomic alteration between DP and TP based on biological process and pathway enrichment analysis, and 13 higher abundance chloroplast proteins involving in these two pathways were identified in TP. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that 5 of the 13 chloroplast proteins ATPF, PSAA, PSAB, PSBB and RBL in TP were higher abundance compared with those in DP. This study integrates morphology, physiology and proteomic profiling alteration of DP and TP to address their underlying different molecular mechanisms. Our finding revealed that ATPF, PSAA, PSAB, PSBB and RBL can induce considerable expression changes in TP and may affect the development and growth of rice through photosynthesis and metabolic pathways.",

Because of the lack of understanding, the complex mechanisms involved in the transport process, in particular for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP / ABCG2), there is a persistent need for studies of inhibitors of ABCG2. In this study, we investigated a systematic series of 4-substituted-2-pyridylquinazolines in terms of their inhibitory potency as well as selectivity toward ABCG2. For comparison, the quinazoline scaffold was reduced to the significantly smaller 4-methylpyrimidine basic structure. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity and the ability to reverse MDR was tested with the chemotherapeutic agents SN-38 and mitoxantrone (MX). Interaction of the compounds with ABCG2 was investigated by a colorimetric ATPase assay.

However, adult hearts have limited potential for regeneration after pathological injury, partly due to the quiescent status of stem / progenitor cells. Reactivation of cardiac stem / progenitor cells to create more myocyte progeny is one of the key steps in the regeneration of a damaged heart. In this study, miR-708 was identified to be enriched in the neonatal cardiomyocytes of rats, but this has not yet been proven in adult humans. A lower level of miR-708 in c-kit(+) stem / progenitor cells was detected compared to non-progenitors. Overexpression of miR-708 induced cardiomyocyte differentiation of cardiac stem / progenitor cells. This finding strengthened the potential of applying miRNAs in the regeneration of injured hearts, and this indicates that miR-708 could be a novel candidate for treatment of heart diseases.",
  "27252904": "Comparison of the Effects of Subcutaneous Versus Continuous Infusion of Heparin on Key Inflammatory Parameters Following Sepsis Sepsis is the result of the interaction between inflammatory mediators and coagulation pathway. Unfractionated heparin may play a role as an anti-inflammatory agent beyond its anticoagulatory effect in sepsis. As a result, it may cause reduction in organ failure rate in patients with sepsis due to its impact on both inflammatory and coagulation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of heparin in sepsis. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as an inflammatory mediator and urinary necoutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as a marker of kidney injury were investigated. This prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 32- bed intensive care unit. Thirty patients with sepsis were randomized to receive heparin infusion of 500 units/hour or 5000 units of heparin three times a day, subcutaneously. The plasma level of PAI-1 and urinary level of NGAL were determined at day 0, 2 and 7. The infusion group had a lower plasma PAI-1 level compared to the subcutaneous group at day 7 (11.3 ± 1.6 vs. 16.5 ± 4.2; P = 0.003). The urinary NGAL level was lower in the infusion group at day 2 (131.3 ± 11.9 vs. 151.2 ± 20.6; P = 0.014); however, at day 7 the NGAL level was decreased in the subcutaneous group as much as the infusion group and there was no significant difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores between the two groups at day 0, 2 and 7. Low-dose heparin infusion compared to subcutaneous heparin can decrease the plasma PAI-1 and urinary NGAL levels more rapidly. It can be related to anti-inflammatory effects of heparin, which may be more prominent in infusion route.",

The teeth were divided into 3 groups. In the control group, cavities were restored with composite resin after etching and bonding (n=15). In Group 2, 500-μm thick wax was placed over the buccal, lingual and gingival walls and the cavities were restored with composite resin. Group 3 specimens were subjected to pH cycling and artificial caries were created on the buccal, lingual and gingival walls. The cavities were restored with composite. Conventional and digital photo-stimulable phosphor (PSP; Optime) radiographs and two CBCTs images (NewTom 3G and Cranex 3D) were obtained from them. Presence or absence of caries in the cavity walls was assessed on these images. Data were analyzed using Kappa statistic. The diagnostic accuracy of CBCT was significantly higher than that of digital and conventional intraoral radiography (p<0.05). The accuracy was 0.83, 0.78, 0.55 and 0.49 for CBCT Cranex 3D, CBCT NewTom 3G, conventional and digital intraoral radiography, respectively.

In the present study, 22.8% (84/369) of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates associated with various types of invasive infections were identified as HMKP, with 45.2% associated with PLA. Multivariate regression analysis showed that male patients with 41-50 years, PLA, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were independent risk factors for HMKP infections. K2 (42.9%, 36/84) was the most common capsular serotype among HMKP isolates, followed by K1 (23.8%, 20/84). Seventy-five percentage of K1 HMKP isolates were associated with PLA, while K2 HMKP isolates accounted for more types of invasive infections. The positive rates of iutA, mrkD, aerobactin, iroN, and rmpA among HMKP isolates were significantly higher than those among non-HMKP isolates (p < 0.05). There was a correlation between magA, ybtS, alls, and wcaG and K1 isolates. Interestingly, mrkD was exclusively detected among HMKP (32.1%, 27/84) and K2 isolates (65.9%, 27/41). All K1 and K2 HMKP and non-HMKP isolates were positive for rmpA. Aerobactin was found among 95.0 and 97.5% of K1 and K2 isolates. ST23 was found to be the most prevalent ST among 69 HMKP isolates with K1, K2, K5, K20, and K57 (27.5%, 19/69) and was only found among K1 isolates. ST65 was the second most prevalent ST (26.1%, 18/69) and was also only found among K2 isolates. ST23-K1 HMKP isolates (84.2%, 16/19) were associated with PLA, while ST65-K2 isolates were correlated with more types of infections relative to ST23-K1 isolates. PFGE results showed that the homology of 84 HMKP isolates was diverse. Only five PFGE clusters with more than 75% similarity accounted for more than three isolates. These five PFGE clusters only accounted for 35 (41.7%, 35/84) isolates. In conclusion, our study first found that hypertension and male patients with 41-50 years old were independent risk factors. The composition of ST types and PFGE clusters among K. pneumoniae K2 isolates was more diverse than K1 isolates. K1 and K2 HMKP isolates had respective specific profiles of virulence - associated genes.",

Moraxella nonliquefaciens is an unusual organism to be isolated from cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and there exists only one case report of M. nonliquefaciens meningitis from a neonate. Moraxella species normally exist as part of the human upper respiratory tract flora and rarely cause invasive human disease. There are only a handful of case reports implicating the organism as a cause of endocarditis, bacteraemia, septic arthritis and endophthalmitis. Identification to the species level based on routine laboratory techniques has been challenging, with final identification often made through 16S rRNA sequencing. With the use of a newer diagnostic tool, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, we were able to rapidly identify the organism and initiate appropriate treatment. Case presentation. We present a rare care of M. nonliquefaciens meningitis in a paediatric patient with an underlying cranial anatomical defect due to Crouzon syndrome. She had been admitted to hospital 3 months previously with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis and mastoiditis, and returned to the emergency department with meningismus. CSF culture grew M. nonliquefaciens. She was treated with ceftriaxone with rapid improvement and eventually was taken for endoscopic surgical repair of a right encephalocele defect. Conclusion. The use of MALDI-TOF MS allowed for the rapid identification of the organism. The patient recovered with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and eventual surgical correction. An underlying anatomical defect should be considered in all patients who present with meningitis due to this unusual organism.",

The hydrogel fibers are made from optimal combination of alginate and poly(N-iso-propylacrylamide)-poly(ethylene glycol), characteristics of double-network hydrogel, with enough stiffness and flexibility to create a variety of three dimensional structures like parallel helical and different knots without crack. Furthermore, such hydrogel fibers exhibit better compatibility as indicated by the viability, proliferation and expression of pluripotency markers of embryonic stem cells encapsulated after 4-day culture. The double-network hydrogel possesses specific quick responses to either of alginate lyase, EDTA or lower environmental temperature which facilitate the optional degradation of fibers or fibrous assemblies to release the cells encapsulated for subsequent assay or treatment.",

These techniques and methods need periodical documentation. This observational study determined the current prevalence of endodontic treatments, and investigated the relationship of various factors with the periapical status in a Lower Austrian subpopulation. One thousand orthopantomograms of first-time university adult patients radiographed at an outpatient clinic were evaluated. For each tooth, the presence of periradicular pathosis and/or endodontic treatment was recorded, as was the quality of (post-) endodontic treatment (homogeneity and length of root canal fillings; preparation failures; posts / screws; apicoectomies; coronal restorations). Two evaluators, blinded to each other, scored all teeth. In cases of disagreement, they joined for a consensus score. In all, 22,586 teeth were counted. Of these, 2,907 teeth (12.9%) had periapical pathosis, while 2,504 teeth had undergone root canal treatment. Of the endodontically treated teeth, 52% showed no radiographic signs of apical periodontitis, while 44.9% had overt apical lesions, and 3,1% revealed widened periodontal ligament space. The majority of the root canal fillings was inhomogeneous (70.4%); 75.4% were rated too short, and 3.8% too long. The presence of apical pathosis was significantly correlated (odds ratio (OR) 2.556 [confidence interval (CI) 2.076-3.146]; P<0.0001) with poor root canal fillings (length and homogeneity). Posts or screws positively affected periapical status (OR 1.853 [CI 1.219-2.819]; P = 0.004), but endodontically treated posterior teeth were infrequently restored (posts, 7.5%; screws, 2.7%). Best results were found for teeth with both appropriate endodontic treatment and adequate coronal restoration. A high prevalence of periradicular radiolucencies was observed with root canal filled teeth, along with high numbers of unmet treatment needs. Periapical health was associated with adequate root canal obturation and high-grade postendodontic restorations, and quality regarding these latter aspects is considered mandatory to promote periapical health.",
  "28082609": "Variation in the Intensity of Selection on Codon Bias over Time Causes Contrasting Patterns of Base Composition Evolution in Drosophila Four-fold degenerate coding sites form a major component of the genome, and are often used to make inferences about selection and demography, so that understanding their evolution is important. Despite previous efforts, many questions regarding the causes of base composition changes at these sites in Drosophila remain unanswered. To shed further light on this issue, we obtained a new whole-genome polymorphism data set from D. simulans. We analyzed samples from the putatively ancestral range of D. simulans, as well as an existing polymorphism data set from an African population of D. melanogaster. By using D. yakuba as an outgroup, we found clear evidence for selection on 4-fold sites along both lineages over a substantial period, with the intensity of selection increasing with GC content. Based on an explicit model of base composition evolution, we suggest that the observed AT- biased substitution pattern in both lineages is probably due to an ancestral reduction in selection intensity, and is unlikely to be the result of an increase in mutational bias towards AT alone. By using two polymorphism-based methods for estimating selection coefficients over different timescales, we show that the selection intensity on codon usage has been rather stable in D. simulans in the recent past, but the long-term estimates in D. melanogaster are much higher than the short-term ones, indicating a continuing decline in selection intensity, to such an extent that the short-term estimates suggest that selection is only active in the most GC -rich parts of the genome. Finally, we provide evidence for complex evolutionary patterns in the putatively neutral short introns, which cannot be explained by the standard GC - biased gene conversion model. These results reveal a dynamic picture of base composition evolution.",
  "28374022": "A coarse-grained model for assisting the investigation of structure and dynamics of large nucleic acids by ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry (IMS-MS) is a rapidly emerging tool for the investigation of nucleic acid structure and dynamics. IMS-MS determinations can provide valuable information regarding alternative topologies, folding intermediates, and conformational heterogeneities, which are not readily accessible to other analytical techniques. The leading strategies for data interpretation rely on computational and experimental approaches to correctly assign experimental observations to putative structures. A very effective strategy involves the application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the structure of the analyte molecule, calculate its collision cross section (CCS), and then compare this computational value with the corresponding experimental data. While this approach works well for small nucleic acid species, analyzing larger nucleic acids of biological interest is hampered by the computational cost associated with capturing their extensive structure and dynamics in all-atom detail. In this report, we describe the implementation of a coarse graining (CG) approach to reduce the cost of the computational methods employed in the data interpretation workflow. Our framework employs a five-bead model to accurately represent each nucleotide in the nucleic acid structure. The beads are appropriately parameterized to enable the direct calculation of CCS values from CG models, thus affording the ability to pursue the analysis of larger, highly dynamic constructs. The validity of this approach was successfully confirmed by the excellent correlation between the CCS values obtained in parallel by all-atom and CG workflows.",

GEnC were cultured under normal or high -glucose conditions in the presence or not of the GCN2 kinase activator, tryptophanol. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression was assessed by western blotting and reactive oxygen species (ROS) using a fluorogenic probe. Activities of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and protein kinase C (PKC) were assessed by commercial activity assays, sorbitol colorimetrically, methylglyoxal by ELISA and O-linked β-N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc)-modified proteins by western blotting. High glucose induced GLUT1 expression, increased ROS and inhibited GAPDH. Also it increased the polyol pathway product sorbitol, PKC activity, the level of the O-GlcNAc-modified proteins that produced by the hexosamine pathway and the advanced glycation endproducts' precursor methylglyoxal. Co-treatment of GEnC with tryptophanol restored the above high-glucose - induced alterations. Activation of GCN2 kinase protects GEnC from high-glucose - induced harmful molecular pathways. By inhibiting concurrently many pathways involved in DN pathogenesis, GCN2 kinase may serve as a pharmaceutical target for the treatment of DN.",
  "27659547": "The link between self-perceptions of aging, cancer view and physical and mental health of older people with cancer: A cross-sectional study Older people may suffer from stigmas linked to cancer and aging. Although some studies suggested that a negative view of cancer may increase the level of depression, such an association has never been studied in the elderly population. Similarly, even though it is established that a negative self-perception of aging has deleterious consequences on mental and physical health in normal aging, the influence in pathological contexts, such as oncology, has not been studied. The main aim of this study is thus to analyze the effect of these two stigmas on the health of elderly oncology patients. 101 patients suffering from a cancer (breast, gynecological, lung or hematological) were seen as soon as possible after their diagnosis. Their self-perception of age, cancer view and health (physical and mental) was assessed. Multiple regressions showed that patients with a more negative self-perception of aging and/or more negative cancer view reported poorer global health. We also observed that negative self-perception of aging was associated with worse physical and mental health, whereas negative cancer views were only linked to worse mental health. No interaction was observed between these two stigmas, suggesting that their action is independent. Older patients with cancer face double stigmatization, due to negative self-perception of aging and cancer, and these stigmas have impacts on global and mental health. Self-perception of aging is also linked to physical health. Longitudinal studies will be necessary to analyze the direction of the association between this double stigmatization and health.",

In this report, however, the authors describe a rare case of a 61- year -old woman with hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly (elevation of insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1]) with elevated growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) in whom an MRI demonstrated diffuse enlargement of the pituitary gland. Despite medical treatment, the patient had persistent elevation of IGF-1. She underwent a transsphenoidal biopsy, which yielded a diagnosis of DLBCL with an activated B-cell immunophenotype with somatotroph hyperplasia. After stereo-tactic radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy, she is currently in remission from her lymphoma and has normalized IGF-1 levels without medical therapy, 8 months after her histopathological diagnosis. This is the only reported case of its kind and displays the importance of a broad differential diagnosis, multidisciplinary evaluation, and critical intraoperative decision-making when treating atypical sellar lesions.",

Final results of the GIMEMA LAL 0904 study In the GIMEMA LAL 0904 protocol, adult Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were treated with chemotherapy for induction and consolidation, followed by maintenance with imatinib. The protocol was subsequently amended and imatinib was incorporated in the induction and post - remission phase together with chemotherapy. Due to the toxicity of this combined approach, the protocol was further amended to a sequential scheme based on imatinib plus steroids as induction, followed by consolidation with chemotherapy plus imatinib and, when applicable, by a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Fifty-one patients (median age: 45.9 years) were enrolled in the final sequential protocol, hereby reported. At the end of induction (day +50), 96% of evaluable patients (n=49) achieved a complete hematologic remission; after consolidation, all were in complete hematologic remission. No deaths in induction were recorded. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 60 months are 48.8% and 45.8%, respectively. At day +50 (end of the imatinib induction), a log - reduction of BCR-ABL1 levels >1.3 was associated with a significantly more prolonged disease-free survival (55.6%, C.I. 95%: 39.0-79.3 vs 20%, C.I. 95%: 5.8-69.1; p =0.03), overall survival (59.1%, C.I. 95%: 42.3-82.6 vs 20%, C.I. 95%: 5.8-69.1, p =0.02) and lower relapse incidence (20.5%, C.I. 95%: 7.2-38.6 vs 60.0%, C.I. 95%: 21.6-84.3, p =0.01). Mean BCR-ABL1 levels remained significantly higher in patients who subsequently relapsed. Finally, BCR-ABL1p190 patients showed a significantly faster molecular response than BCR-ABL1p210 patients (p =0.023). Thought the study was not powered to evaluate the role of allogeneic stem cell transplant, allografting positively impacted on overall survival and disease-free survival.

Experiments were carried out on Male Sprague-Dawley rats that were split into four groups at random: TBI - fracture group, fracture - only group, TBI - only group, and control group. In the first week, blood specimen would be drawn from rats among the groups except those of the control group at three-time points (24, 72 and 168 hours) post - damage. These rats would be assessed from the neurological perspective based on their grades of performance in a sequence of tests 24 hours before and 12 hours after brain injury. Blood samples were also taken from the control group 24 hours before the injury, and whole brain tissues in the injured groups were harvested at 72 and 168 hours post - injury. We compared the serum CGRP concentration, the distribution of CGRP, the CGRP expression, and the expression of CGRP in the hippocampus, the expression of CGRP in the hippocampus, the expression of CGRP in the hippocampus, and the expression of CGRP in the brain by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, RT - Of CGRP RNA expression levels. Neurological examinations suggested that the functions of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem showed significant differences pre - and post - injury (p < 0.001). ELISA analysis indicated a great density of CGRP in TBI - fracture group at different time points. Furthermore, in the TBI - fracture group, CGRP in both hippocampus and the whole brain showed a noticeable augment in RT-PCR and western blot analysis at 72 and 168 h post - injury, and only in this group, immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that CGRP was present in the hippocampus at 168 hours post - injury. We observed that the hippocampus and CGRP were responsible for quick bone-healing mechanisms. We suggest a role for the hippocampus in accelerated fracture healing. CGRP expression, as determined by IHC, cannot be observed in other groups, indicating that the hippocampus may be the specific component of the brain that responds to \" big stress \".",

The objective of this study was to assess predictors of provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) refusal by outpatient department (OPD) clients in Wolaita zone, Southern Ethiopia. Facility based unmatched case control study was conducted on outpatient department clients in randomly selected seven health facilities in Wolaita zone, Southern Ethiopia in February 2012. A total of 291 participants (97 cases and 194 controls) were included in our study. Cases were patients who refused HIV test while controls were patients who tested for HIV after provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) recommendation by outpatient department (OPD) clinicians. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. Pretested interviewer administered questionnaires were used to collect quantitative data by trained nurses, and in-depth interview with 14 OPD clinicians was conducted by principal investigator to supplement quantitative findings. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done to identify independent predictors of provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling refusal by OPD clients. Study participants who had stigmatizing attitude [AOR =6.09, (95 % CI: 1.70, 21.76)], who had perceived risk for HIV infection [AOR =5.23, (95 % CI: 2.22, 12.32)], who did not perceive the benefits of provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling [AOR =4.64, (95 % CI: 1.79, 12.01)], who did not get minimum recommended pretest information from their providers [AOR =2.98, (95 % CI: 1.06, 8.35)], who ever not heard of provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling service [AOR =2.41, (95 % CI: 1.14, 5.09)], and who were from urban area [AOR =2.40, (95 % CI =1.26, 4.57)] were more likely to refuse provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling service than their counterparts.

  "27296942": "Prediction of Clinically Significant Bleeding Following Wide-Field Endoscopic Resection of Large Sessile and Laterally Spreading Colorectal Lesions: A Clinical Risk Score Clinically significant bleeding (CSPEB) is the most frequent adverse event following wide-field endoscopic mucosal resection (WF-EMR) of large sessile and laterally spreading colorectal lesions (LSL). There is limited knowledge regarding accurate prediction of CSPEB. We aimed to derive a score to predict the risk of CSPEB. Data on patient and lesion characteristics and outcomes from WF-EMRs of LSL ≥20 mm at 8 referral hospitals were analyzed. The cohort was divided at random into equal sized training and test groups. Independent predictors of CSPEB in the training cohort were identified by multiple logistic regression analysis and used to develop a risk score. The performance of this score was assessed in the independent test cohort. Over 80 months to June 2015, 2,128 patients with 2,424 LSL were referred for WF-EMR. Two thousand and twelve patients were eligible for analysis. There were 135 cases of CSPEB (6.7%). In the training cohort of 1,006 patients, the independent predictors of CSPEB were lesion size >30 mm (odds ratio (OR) 2.5), proximal colonic location (OR 2.3), presence of a major comorbidity (OR 1.5), and epinephrine in injection solution (OR 0.57). The derived risk score comprised lesion size >30 mm (2 points), proximal colon (2 points), presence of major comorbidity (1 point), and absence of epinephrine use (1 point). The probabilities of CSPEB for scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥5 in the training cohort were 1.5, 2.0, 5.6, 7.8, 9.1, and 17.5% and were 0.9, 6.7, 4.9, 6.2, 9.0, and 15.7% in the test cohort. The probabilities of CSPEB in those with low (score 0-1), medium (score 2-4), and elevated (score 5-6) risk levels were 1.7, 7.1, and 17.5% in the training cohort and 3.4, 6.2, and 15.7% in the cohort. Patients at elevated risk of CSPEB can be identified using four readily available variables. This knowledge may improve the management of those undergoing WF-EMR and assist in designing studies evaluating CSPEB.",

Injectable insulin has been typically utilized for the management of this chronic disease. However, lack of patient compliance with injectable formulations has spurred the development of oral insulin formulations, which although appealing, face several delivery challenges. We have developed novel mucoadhesive intestinal patches, several hundred micrometers in dimension (micropatches) that address the challenges of oral insulin delivery. The micropatches adhere to the intestinal mucosa, release their drug load rapidly within 30 min and are effective in lowering blood glucose levels in vivo. When insulin -loaded micropatches were administered with a permeation enhancer and protease inhibitor, a peak efficacy of 34% drop in blood glucose levels was observed within 3 h. Efficacy further improved to 41% when micropatches were administered in multiple doses. Here, we describe the design of micropatches as an oral insulin formulation and report their in vivo efficacy.",

A Qualitative Study of Decision-Making, Hopes, and Realities of Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Undergoing Islet Cell Transplantation For selected individuals with type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islet transplantation (IT) prevents recurrent severe hypoglycemia and optimizes glycemia, although ongoing systemic immunosuppression is needed. Our aim was to explore candidates and recipients ' expectations of transplantation, their experience of being on the waiting list, and (for recipients) the procedure and life posttransplant. Cross-sectional qualitative research design using semistructured interviews with 16 adults (8 pretransplant, 8 posttransplant; from 4 UK centers (n = 13) and 1 Canadian center (n = 3)). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and underwent inductive thematic analysis. Interviewees were aged (mean ± SD) 52 ± 10 years (range, 30-64); duration of diabetes, 36 ± 9 years (range, 21-56); 12 (75%) were women. Narrative accounts centered on expectations, hopes, and realities; decision-making; waiting and uncertainty; the procedure, hospital stay, and follow-up. Expected benefits included fewer severe hypoglycemic episodes, reduced need for insulin, preventing onset/progression of complications and improved psychological well-being. These were realized for most, at least in the short term. Most interviewees described well-informed, shared decision-making with clinicians and family, and managing their expectations. Although life \"on the list\" could be stressful, and immunosuppressant side effects were severe, interviewees reported \" no regrets .\" Posttransplant, interviewees experienced increased confidence, through freedom from hypoglycemia and regained glycemic control, which tempered any disappointment about continued reliance on insulin. Most viewed their transplant as a success, though several reflected upon setbacks and hidden hopes for becoming \" insulin-free .\" Independently undertaken interviews demonstrated realistic and balanced expectations of IT and indicate how to optimize the process and support for future IT candidates.",
  "27503306": "Preclinical fibrinolysis in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in a rural region In the current guidelines for the treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends preclinical fibrinolysis as a reperfusion therapy if, due to long transportation times, no cardiac catheterisation is available within 90-120 min. However, there is little remaining in-depth expertise in this method because fibrinolysis is presently only rarely indicated. In a rural area in southwestern Germany, where an emergency primary percutaneous coronary intervention was not routinely available within 90-120 min, 156 STEMI patients underwent fibrinolysis with the plasminogen activator reteplase, performed by trained emergency physicians. The practicality of the treatment, as well as complications and the mortality of the patients in the preclinical phase until arrival at the hospital, were retrospectively studied. The mean time from onset of the symptoms to first medical contact was 114 ± 116 min. The mean interval to the start of fibrinolysis of 13.5 ± 6.4 min was within the 30 min mandated by the ESC. Patients with inferior STEMI represented the largest subgroup. Occurring in 39 cases (25 %), complications due to infarction were relatively common during the prehospital phase, including 15 cases (9.6 %) of cardiogenic shock, but in all cases the complications were manageable. No patient died before arrival at the hospital. As lysis - associated adverse effects, merely two uncomplicated mucosal haemorrhages and one case of mild allergic skin reactions were seen. In emergency situations with long transportation times to the nearest suitable cardiac catheterisation laboratory, preclinical fibrinolysis in STEMI still represents a workable method. Success of this strategy requires particularly strong training of the emergency physicians in ECG and lysis therapy, and co-operation with nearby cardiac centres.",

Pam3CSK4, a triacylated lipoprotein, is anchored to the extracellular domain of TLR1 and TLR2 and induces pro-inflammatory signals. Here we show that C4b binding protein (C4BP), which is a complement pathway inhibitor, is a TLR2 -associated molecule. Immunoprecipitation assay using anti-TLR2 mAb shows that C4BP binds to TLR2. In C4BP-deficient mice, Pam3CSK4 - induced IL-6 levels were increased compared with wild type mice. In C4BP - expressing cells, Pam3CSK4 - induced IL-8 production was reduced depending on the C4BP expression levels. These results reveal the important role of C4BP in negative regulation of TLR1 / 2 - dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, using a fluorescent conjugated Pam3CSK4, we show that C4BP blocks the binding of Pam3CSK4 to TLR1 / 2. Finally, we show that exogenous C4BP also inhibits Pam3CSK4 - induced signaling leading to IL-8 production. Our results indicate C4BP binding to TLR2 and consequent neutralization of its activity otherwise inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. C4BP is a negative regulator of TLR1 / 2 activity.",
  "28296885": "Oral health in transition: The Hadza foragers of Tanzania Conventional wisdom holds that a decline in oral health accompanies the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, given increased consumption of carbohydrates. This widely touted example of the mismatch between our biology and modern lifestyle has been intuited largely from the bioarchaeological record of the Neolithic Revolution in the New World. Recent studies of other populations have, however, challenged the universality of this assertion. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of oral health among a living population in transition from the bush to village life, the Hadza hunter - gatherers of Tanzania, to test the hypothesis that the shift from foraging to farming, or agricultural intensification, inevitably leads to increased periodontal disease, caries, and orthodontic disorders. Our results showed that women living in villages consuming a mostly agricultural diet exhibited more caries and periodontal disease than those living in the bush consuming a mostly wild-food diet. Furthermore, men living in the bush consuming mostly a wild-food diet had more than those living in the village consuming a mostly agricultural diet. These findings are explained by the high incidence of maize consumption in village settings, along with previously recognized variation in rate of caries between men and women. The unexpected discovery of high caries incidences for men in the bush is likely explained by heavy reliance on honey, and perhaps differential access to tobacco and marijuana. These data support the notions that mechanisms of cariogenesis are multifactorial and that the relationships between oral health and the shift from a predominantly wild-food diet to one dominated by cultigens are nuanced.",

ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered as one of the prominent clinical forms of ACS. Moreover, C-reactive protein (CRP) is an important acute phase prsotein, which may be estimated using high-sensitivity methods (hs-CRP), and its elevated level in body fluids reflects chronic inflammatory status. The circulating hs-CRP level has been proposed as a promising inflammatory marker of coronary artery disease (CAD). The present study investigated the correlation of hs-CRP level with clinical and angiographic features of STEMI, various other traditional risk factors, complications of myocardial infarction and angiographically significant CAD. Out of 190 patients with STEMI that were analyzed, the interval between symptom onset and reperfusion therapy (window period) varied from 0.5 to 24 h. The hs-CRP value was found to be higher in non-diabetic patients (0.61 mg/dl) compared with diabetic patients (0.87 mg/dl). Moreover, a significant correlation between hs-CRP and hs-troponin T was also recorded (P<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the mean hs-CRP values in patients with or without mortality. It is considered that the present study will increase the understanding of atherosclerosis in general and may also have clinical applications in the targeting of therapy for this harmful disease.",
  "27382354": "Effects of analgesics and antidepressants on TREK-2 and TRESK currents TWIK-related K(+) channel-2 (TREK-2) and TWIK-related spinal cord K(+) (TRESK) channel are members of two-pore domain K(+) channel family. They are well expressed and help to set the resting membrane potential in sensory neurons. Modulation of TREK-2 and TRESK channels are involved in the pathogenesis of pain, and specifi c activators of TREK-2 and TRESK may be benefi cial for the treatment of pain symptoms. However, the effect of commonly used analgesics on TREK-2 and TRESK channels are not known. Here, we investigated the effect of analgesics on TREK-2 and TRESK channels. The effects of analgesics were examined in HEK cells transfected with TREK-2 or TRESK. Amitriptyline, citalopram, escitalopram, and fluoxetine significantly inhibited TREK-2 and TRESK currents in HEK cells (p<0.05, n=10). Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, nabumetone, and bupropion inhibited TRESK, but had no effect on TREK-2. These results show that all analgesics tested in this study inhibit TRESK activity. Further study is needed to identify the mechanisms by which the analgesics modulate TREK-2 and TRESK differently.",
  "28351716": "Diagnosis of retinal health in digital fundus images using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and entropies Vision is paramount to humans to lead an active personal and professional life. The prevalence of ocular diseases is rising, and diseases such as glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) are the leading causes of blindness in developed countries. Identifying these diseases in mass screening programmes is time-consuming, labor -intensive and the diagnosis can be subjective. The use of an automated computer aided diagnosis system will reduce the time taken for analysis and will also reduce the inter-observer subjective variabilities in image interpretation. In this work, we propose one such system for the automatic classification of normal from abnormal (DR, AMD, glaucoma) images. We had a total of 404 normal and 1082 abnormal fundus images in our database. As the first step, 2D-Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) decomposition on the fundus images of two classes was performed. Subsequently, energy features and various entropies namely Yager, Renyi, Kapoor, Shannon, and Fuzzy were extracted from the decomposed images. Then, adaptive synthetic sampling approach was applied to balance the normal and abnormal datasets. Next, the extracted features were ranked according to the significances using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Thereupon, the ranked and selected features were used to train the random forest classifier using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Overall, the proposed system presented a performance rate of 92.48%, and a sensitivity and specificity of 89.37% and 95.58% respectively using 15 features. This novel system shows promise in detecting abnormal fundus images, and hence, could be a valuable adjunct eye health screening tool that could be employed in polyclinics, and thereby reduce the workload of specialists at hospitals.",
  "27330692": "Evaluation of the Effects of Intravenous and Percutaneous Low Level Laser Therapy in the Management of Shoulder Myofascial Pain Syndrome Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) treatment is challenging with a high recurrence rate and still lacks a clear treatment frame. Therefore research on new, more efficient and long lasting effect treatment modalities is necessary. This study looked at the effects of intravenous laser therapy (IVL) and percutaneous low level laser (PLLL) in the management of shoulder MPS. In this randomized controlled trial, 30 patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were randomly equally allocated to 3 groups, control, IVL and PLLL. Control group received 12 sessions of placebo low level laser, IVL group received 12 sessions of IVL therapy, and PLLL group received 12 sessions of PLLL therapy. All patients were trained for better body posture, body mechanics, gentle massage of trigger points, stretching exercises of affected muscle (trapezius), and received 10 mg of oral nortriptyline regimen every night for 3 months. Outcomes included pain severity, functional disability, and quality of life. Patients were assessed using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Pain Disability Index (PDI), and Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Data collected were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Mann-Whitney and t tests. The mean of PDI and maximum pain intensity during day and night significantly reduced in both PLLL and IVL groups compared to control group. Although pain severity and PDI reduction was more pronounced in IVL group compared to PLLL group, the differences were not statistically significant. Also, quality of life statistically significantly improved in both IVL and PLLL groups compared to control group was more, and although higher in IVL group, the difference was not statistically significant when compared to PLLL group. No side effects were observed in the intervention groups. Intravenous laser and PLLL therapy had a positive effect on pain severity and PDI reduction, and quality of life in this study. Also no adverse event was recorded. Thus, intravenous lasers and PLLL therapy seem to be effective complementary modalities in managing patients with shoulder MPS.",
  "28349200": "Dispersal traits may reflect dispersal distances, but dispersers may not connect populations demographically Ecological traits that reflect movement potential are often used as proxies for measured dispersal distances. Whether such traits reflect actual dispersal is often untested. Such tests are important because maximum dispersal distances may not be achieved and many dispersal events may be unsuccessful (without reproduction). For insects, many habitat patches harbour ' resident ' species that are present as larvae (sedentary) and adults (winged and dispersing), and ' itinerant ' species present only as adults that have dispersed from elsewhere and fail to reproduce. We tested whether itinerancy patterns were temporally consistent, and whether itinerant and resident species differed in wing morphology, a strong correlate of flight capability. Over 3 years and at multiple locations in a 22 km stream length, we sampled larvae and adults of caddisflies in the genus Ecnomus to categorize species as residents or itinerants. Flight capacity was measured using wing size (length and area) and shape parameters (aspect ratio and the second moment of wing area). Three species of Ecnomus were residents and three species were itinerants, and patterns were consistent over 3 years. On average, itinerant species had larger wings, suggesting a greater capacity to fly long distances. Wing shape differed between species, but did not differ systematically between residents and itinerants. Wing morphology was associated with actual but not effective dispersal of some species of Ecnomus. Morphological traits may have weak explanatory power for hypotheses regarding the demographic connectedness of populations, unless accompanied by data demonstrating which dispersers contribute new individuals to populations."
